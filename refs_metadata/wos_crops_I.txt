AB Classification and recognition of crops is an important prerequisite for crop yield estimation and crop growth monitoring. Rapid and accurate acquisition of crop type, spatial distribution and area information can provide basic basis for crop planting structure optimization and structural reform of agricultural supply side. It is of great significance to the formulation of agricultural policy, the development of social economy and the guarantee of national food security. In recent years, hyperspectral remote sensing has been able to fine classify crop types and varieties and obtain spatial distribution maps and planting structure information of crops by virtue of its many hands, abundant spectral information and sensitivity to small spectral differences among ground objects. This paper summarizes the application of hyperspectral remote sensing in crop fine classification, summarizes the hyperspectral data sources commonly used in crop fine classification at home and abroad, such as Hyperion data, environmental satellite data, CASI data and OMIS data, and analyses the applicability of various data. Meanwhile, the methods of crop fine classification using hyperspectral remote sensing are summarized, including decision tree classification, support vector machine classification, multi-classifier integration, spatial-spectral feature classification, hyperspectral data and radar data fusion classification, and the characteristics of various classification methods are analyzed. It was found that the classification accuracy of crop fine classification based on hyperspectral data was higher (better than 90%). But there are still some shortcomings: (1) At present, scholars at home and abroad focus on areas with simple planting structure. Most of the crop types in these areas are rice, wheat and other large-scale food crops, but less on cash crops such as sesame, rape, peanut and so on. (2) Hyperspectral remote sensing has high classification accuracy for regions with fewer crop types, but the classification accuracy needs to be improved in regions with many crop types. (3) Hyperspectral data has a high dimension and a large amount of data processing workload, which is not suitable for fine classification of crops in large-scale areas. Future research directions: (1) Expanding the scope of hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring objects, mainly cash crops. (2) Selecting areas with complex planting structure, fragmented plots, fluctuating topography and various crop types for fine classification of crops. (3) Attaching importance to the essential features of hyperspectral remote sensing fine classification and finding a stable classifier which is generally suitable for crop fine classification. (4) The mechanism of crop fine classification using hyperspectral remote sensing and the method of multi-source data fusion need to be further studied.

AB Due to the increasing demand for the monitoring of crop conditions and food production, it is a challenging and meaningful task to identify crops from remote sensing images. The state-of the-art crop classification models are mostly built on supervised classification models such as support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long- and short-term memory neural networks (LSTM). Meanwhile, as an unsupervised generative model, the adversarial generative network (GAN) is rarely used to complete classification tasks for agricultural applications. In this work, we propose a new method that combines GAN, CNN, and LSTM models to classify crops of corn and soybeans from remote sensing time-series images, in which GAN's discriminator was used as the final classifier. The method is feasible on the condition that the training samples are small, and it fully takes advantage of spectral, spatial, and phenology features of crops from satellite data. The classification experiments were conducted on crops of corn, soybeans, and others. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparisons with models of SVM, SegNet, CNN, LSTM, and different combinations were also conducted. The results show that our method achieved the best classification results, with the Kappa coefficient of 0.7933 and overall accuracy of 0.86. Experiments in other study areas also demonstrate the extensibility of the proposed method.

AB Analysis and simulation of watershed-scale processes requires spatial characterization of land use, including differentiation among crop types. If this crop type information could be obtained accurately from remote sensing data, the effort required would be significantly reduced, especially for large watersheds. The objective of this study was to compare two methods using multiple satellite remote sensing datasets to differentiate land cover, including crop type, for the Salt River/Mark Twain Lake basin in northeast Missouri. Method I involved unsupervised classification of Landsat visible and near-infrared satellite images obtained at multiple dates in the growing season, followed by traditional, manual class identification. Method 2, developed in this research, employed the same unsupervised classification but also used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps obtained on a 16-day cycle from MODIS satellite images as ancillary data to derive seasonal NDVI trends for each class in the classification map. Tree analysis was applied to the NDVI trend data to group similar classes into clusters, and crop type for each cluster was determined from ground-truth data. Additional ground-truth data were used to assess the accuracy of the procedure, and crop acreage estimates were compared to county-level statistics. The overall classification accuracy of Method 2 was 3% higher than that of Method 1. Method 2 was also more efficient in terms of analyst time and ground-truth data requirements. Therefore, this method, employing variations in seasonal NDVI trends, is suggested for differentiation of crop type. The 30-m resolution crop type maps developed using this process will be useful as input data to environmental analysis models.

AB Deep learning technology such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) has achieved outstanding results in the field of crops classification for remote sensing images. The way of land cover or crop types remote sensing classification using CNN is mainly pixel-based classification which is often affected by the phenomenon of "salt and pepper". In order to reduce this effect, an object-oriented crops classification method based on CNN is proposed in this paper. By combining image segmentation technology and CNN model, we use this method to obtain the results of crops classification from Sentinel-2A multi-spectral remote sensing images in Yuanyang County, Henan Province, China. The experiment show that, compared with the pixel level classification based on CNN which only consider the spectral and temporal characteristics of the crops, the method we proposed comprehensively utilizes more detailed information such as spectral feature, texture feature, spatial relationship, and color space. Thus, it gains a better discriminability for some specific crop and achieves higher classification accuracy.

AB Deep learning (DL) is a powerful state-of-the-art technique for image processing including remote sensing (RS) images. This letter describes a multilevel DL architecture that targets land cover and crop type classification from multitemporal multisource satellite imagery. The pillars of the architecture are unsupervised neural network (NN) that is used for optical imagery segmentation and missing data restoration due to clouds and shadows, and an ensemble of supervised NNs. As basic supervised NN architecture, we use a traditional fully connected multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the most commonly used approach in RS community random forest, and compare them with convolutional NNs (CNNs). Experiments are carried out for the joint experiment of crop assessment and monitoring test site in Ukraine for classification of crops in a heterogeneous environment using nineteen multitemporal scenes acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A RS satellites. The architecture with an ensemble of CNNs outperforms the one with MLPs allowing us to better discriminate certain summer crop types, in particular maize and soybeans, and yielding the target accuracies more than 85% for all major crops (wheat, maize, sunflower, soybeans, and sugar beet).

AB Recently, there has been a remarkable growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the development of efficient AI models and high-power computational resources for processing complex datasets. There have been a growing number of applications of machine learning in satellite remote sensing image data processing. In India, agriculture has a huge impact on the national economy and most of the critical decisions are dependent on agricultural statistics. In this work, machine learning models have been applied for crop classification of Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data. Guntur district region of Andhra Pradesh, India has been used as the study area. The main reasons for selecting this region are the diversity of agricultural crops and the availability of ground truth. The performance of machine learning models Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been evaluated for crop classification. Classification accuracies are generally evaluated by using test data. In most cases the classification accuracy from test data is not commensurate to estimated crop areas from the classified image. Such methods limit the estimated crop areas acceptance for official purposes. The uniqueness of this work is the classification accuracy is evaluated by estimated crop areas. The results show that SVM has the best F1 score of 0.99 and estimated major crop areas have 95.9% agreement with the ground surveyed crop area.

AB Plants are a major source of food stuff, medicine and industry. However it is an important and difficult task to recognize species of crop on earth. Therefore it is pertinent to design an appropriate recognition system of crops. As the frontier of space technology is progressed rapidly, remote sensing provides very convenient resource for development in agriculture. In this paper, we proposed a new method for crop classification from satellite imagery. In this method, first of all, we assembled satellite imagery database of different crops and then extract Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features from each crop and then classify them by different individual classifiers. At the end we described analysis of different classifiers that which classifier performed best. Various techniques have been compared against our proposed model for determining the supremacy of our model and results have shown significant improvement in accuracy and reliability.

However, in the field of agriculture, there are few application of crops classification from multi-spectral remote sensing images based on deep learning. In this context, we compared the classification methods of CNN and support vector machines (SVM) in extracting the spatial distribution of crops planting area from Sentineal-2A multi-spectral remote sensing images in Yuanyang county, China. For the region of study, both methods obtained reasonable spatial distribution of different crops, the verification results show that the overall accuracy of CNN is 95.6% which is superior to SVM.

AB Land use and land cover classification from a remote sensing image is a long standing research problem. It ranges from simple classifications like mapping water bodies to complex classifications like crop and forest strands. Crop image classification is complex because of various stages of growth of the same crop, same spectral values for various crops, an other multitude of problems. Crop image classification is very essential for agriculture monitoring, crop yield production, global food security, etc. A new unsupervised algorithm, Spherical Contact Distribution Classification Algorithm (SCDCA) is proposed in this paper which uses mathematical morphology, spherical contact distributions, and first order statistics. Later SCDCA is compared with linear contact distribution classification algorithm (LCDCA). Quantitative analyses prove the efficiency of the algorithm and present that the complexity of SCDCA is very much less when compared to that of LCDCA.(c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Increasing world population, global climate change and environmental deteriorations force food and agriculture sector to increase production under difficult conditions. Crop monitoring and precision agriculture are significant legs in this process and crop classification is usually the first step. Remote sensing provides a less costly and more practical way compared to conventional methods in crop classification. In this study, contribution of spatial information provided by morphological opening and closing profiles to crop classification performances of time series SAR and electro-optical satellite data are assessed separately. In both, significant improvements are observed in overall classification accuracies; however, SAR benefited more from it. In nine-class classification problem, overall classification performance reached around 90% for both sensors.

TI DOCC: Deep one-class crop classification via positive and unlabeled

AB Large-scale crop mapping is an important task in agricultural resource monitoring, but it does usually require the ground-truth labels of all the land-cover types in the remotely sensed imagery. However, labeling each land cover type is time-consuming and labor-intensive. One-class classification, which only needs samples of the class of interest, can solve the problem of redundant labeling. However, the traditional one-class classifiers require well-designed features to realize fine classification, and are thus difficult to apply to complex multi modal remote sensing data, i.e., optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this paper, a deep one-class crop (DOCC) framework that includes a deep one-class crop extraction module and a one-class crop extraction loss module is proposed for large-scale one-class crop mapping. The DOCC framework takes only the samples of one target class as the input to extract the crop of interest by positive and unlabeled learning and can automatically extract the features for one-class crop mapping, without requiring a large amount of labeling for all the land-cover type or feature design based on prior expert knowledge. Experiments conducted on multi-modal remote sensing data, i.e., Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral satellite data, Sentinel-2 multispectral time-series satellite data and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite data, illustrate that DOCC can automatically extract the effective features for one-class classification from multi-modal satellite imagery and reaches the highest F1 accuracy compared with other methods on respective satellite imagery. The results also reveal the different performance of multi-modal satellite imagery when they are used to extract different crop types. Meanwhile, the feasibility of DOCC for multi-modal data can be beneficial for large-scale mapping under different conditions when the samples of multi-class are difficult to obtain.

AB Agriculture department plays vital role on forecasting crop production and acreage estimation in the State. Commodity market estimates crop production on the basis of crop mass arrival in market and field prediction from authorized sources like Crop Advisory Boards. However, it is obvious that estimates from such board and government are often remains unmatched due to non-qualitative and unreliable approaches. The timely and accurate acreage estimation of crop is the pre-requisite for the purpose of better management upon crop production estimation. The conventional methods of gathering information on crop acreage are cumbersome, costly, and protracted, especially when the extent of work is whole county. The crop acreage statistics proves more crucial in event of natural calamity for taking strategic decisions like compensations to farmers based on losses they come up with. In a nutshell, non-availibity of accurate and finely estimated forecast necessitates the formation of coherent policy on fixing up agricultural commodity prices. Finally, soft classification approaches proved to be an alternative to error prone crop statistics by virtue of machine learning algorithms that applied on remote sensing images, a third eye technology which never lies. This paper conferred about gamut of machine learning algorithms for satellite data applications and envisages future trends that would be a magnet for researchers in upcoming years.

AB Accurate crop classification is the basis of agricultural research, and remote sensing is the only effective measuring technique to classify crops over large areas. Optical remote sensing is effective in regions with good illumination; however, it usually fails to meet requirements for highly accurate crop classification in cloud-covered areas and rainy regions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can achieve active data acquisition by transmitting signals; thus, it has strong resistance to cloud and rain interference. In this study, we designed an improved crop planting structure mapping framework for cloudy and rainy regions by combining optical data and SAR data, and we revealed the synchronous-response relationship of these two data types. First, we extracted geo-parcels from optical images with high spatial resolution. Second, we built a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifier suitable for remote sensing images on the geo-parcel scale. Third, we classified crops based on the two datasets and established the network. Fourth, we analyzed the synchronous response relationships of crops based on the results of the two classification schemes. This work is the basis for the application of remote sensing data for the fine mapping and growth monitoring of crop planting structures in cloudy and rainy areas in the future.

AB Remote sensing provides a lucid and effective means for crop coverage identification. Crop coverage identification is a very important technique, as it provides vital information on the type and extent of crop cultivated in a particular area. This information has immense potential in the planning for further cultivation activities and for optimal usage of the available fertile land. As the frontiers of space technology advance, the knowledge derived from the satellite data has also grown in sophistication. Further, image classification forms the core of the solution to the crop coverage identification problem. No single classifier can prove to satisfactorily classify all the basic crop cover mapping problems of a cultivated region. We present in this paper the experimental results of multiple classification techniques for the problem of crop cover mapping of a cultivated region. A detailed comparison of the algorithms inspired by social behaviour of insects and conventional statistical method for crop classification is presented in this paper. These include the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) techniques. The high resolution satellite image has been used for the experiments.

AB Crop area information can provide decision support for agricultural production management, and it is an important basis for formulating grain policy and economic plan. Remote sensing has an irreplaceable role in large-scale agricultural monitoring, in which optical remote sensing is greatly influenced by cloud and rain weather. It is often unable to obtain clear and clear optical remote sensing images in the critical period of crop growth, which seriously images the accuracy and timeliness of the classification of crop remote sensing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capable of monitoring ground objects throughout the day and all weather, Polarimetric SAR data also include scattering matrix, geometric details and permittivity information, it is sensitive to the geometry and height of vegetation, which can make up for the lack of optical remote sensing and has unique advantages in crop identification and monitoring. So full polarization SAR has wide application demand and great potential in crop remote sensing monitoring. The effective use of full polarimetric SAR data to classify crops is of great academic and practical value for promoting the greater role of radar technology in national agricultural remote sensing monitoring and agricultural supply side structural reform. This paper summarizes the different data types and polarization decomposition methods of polarization SAR used in crop identification. According to the current research, there are the following deficiencies: first, most of the research subjects are rice, and dry land crops are less studied. Secondly, the identification of dry land crops is not accurate enough, and the average recognition accuracy is less than 85%. Finally, there are few researches on the scattering mechanism, which leads to poor rationality and poor universality. First, determine the scattering mechanism of dry land crops, and use scattering mechanism to improve the accuracy and universality of remote sensing recognition of dryland crops. Second, how to make use of the special imaging method of SAR to optimize the design is applicable to polarimetric SAR classification algorithm. Third, how to better integrate with optical remote sensing and other multi -source data, these three points will become the key problem to be solved in polarimetric SAR crop classification in the future.

AB The precise classification of crop types is an important basis of agricultural monitoring and crop protection. With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery with high spatial resolution has become the ideal data source for the precise classification of crops. For precise classification of crops with a wide variety of classes and varied spectra, the traditional spectral-based classification method has difficulty in mining large-scale spatial information and maintaining the detailed features of the classes. Therefore, a precise crop classification method using spectral-spatial-location fusion based on conditional random fields (SSLF-CRF) for UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is proposed in this paper. The proposed method integrates the spectral information, the spatial context, the spatial features, and the spatial location information in the conditional random field model by the probabilistic potentials, providing complementary information for the crop discrimination from different perspectives. The experimental results obtained with two UAV-borne high spatial resolution hyperspectral images confirm that the proposed method can solve the problems of large-scale spatial information modeling and spectral variability, improving the classification accuracy for each crop type. This method has important significance for the precise classification of crops in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.

AB Although efforts and progress have been made in crop classification using optical remote sensing images, it is still necessary to make full use of the high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions of remote sensing images. However, with the increasing volume of remote sensing data, a key emerging issue in the field of crop classification is how to find useful information from massive data to balance classification accuracy and processing time. To address this challenge, we developed a novel crop classification method, combining optimal feature selection (OFSM) with hybrid convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) networks for multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. This research used 234 features including spectral, segmentation, color, and texture features from three scenes of Sentinel-2 images to identify crop types in the Jilin province of northeast China. To effectively extract the effective features of remote sensing data with lower time requirements, the use of OFSM was proposed with the results compared with two traditional feature selection methods (TFSM): random forest feature importance selection (RF-FI) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE). Although the time required for OFSM was 26.05 s, which was between RF-FI with 1.97 s and RF-RFE with 132.54 s, OFSM outperformed RF-FI and RF-RFE in terms of the overall accuracy (OA) of crop classification by 4% and 0.3%, respectively. On the basis of obtaining effective feature information, to further improve the accuracy of crop classification we designed two hybrid CNN-RF networks to leverage the advantages of one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG) with random forest (RF), respectively. Based on the selected optimal features using OFSM, four networks were tested for comparison: Conv1D-RF, VGG-RF, Conv1D, and VGG. Conv1D-RF achieved the highest OA at 94.27% as compared with VGG-RF (93.23%), Conv1D (92.59%), and VGG (91.89%), indicating that the Conv1D-RF method with optimal feature input provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation for multi-temporal crop-type classification.

AB Crop classification is one of the foremost and most challenging applications of remote sensing. Crops exhibit both high intra-class variance across geographical locations, as well as low inter-class variance especially across seasons. As such, they require both spectral and temporal input, both of which are provided by the Sentinel 2 satellites. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of our multispectral and multitemporal crop classification analysis, on a region-wide scale, encompassing multiple climatological conditions and a high number of crop types. We have experimented using the ground-truth provided by the Farmer Registration System, with both well-known spectral and spatial shallow features and classifiers, at both pixel and field level, as well as with state of the art 3D convolutional neural networks. Our results show that Sentinel 2 imagery exhibit a strong potential as input for a systematic crop classification infrastructure.

AB Vegetation monitoring and mapping based on multi-temporal imagery has recently received much attention due to the plethora of medium-high spatial resolution satellites and the improved classification accuracies attained compared to uni-temporal approaches. Efficient image processing strategies are needed to exploit the phenological information present in temporal image sequences and to limit data redundancy and computational complexity. Within this framework, we implement the theory of Hidden Markov Models in crop classification, based on the time-series analysis of phenological states, inferred by a sequence of remote sensing observations. More specifically, we model the dynamics of vegetation over an agricultural area of Greece, characterized by spatio-temporal heterogeneity and small-sized fields, using RapidEye and Landsat ETM+ imagery. In addition, the classification performance of image sequences with variable spatial and temporal characteristics is evaluated and compared. The classification model considering one RapidEye and four pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+ images was found superior, resulting in a conditional kappa from 0.77 to 0.94 per class and an overall accuracy of 89.7%. The results highlight the potential of the method for operational crop mapping in Euro-Mediterranean areas and provide some hints for optimal image acquisition windows regarding major crop types in Greece.

AB The increase in performance, availability, and coverage of multispectral satellite sensor constellations has led to a drastic increase in data volume and data rate. Multi-decadal remote sensing datasets at the petabyte scale are now available in commercial clouds, with new satellite constellations generating petabytes/year of daily high-resolution global coverage imagery. The data analysis capability, however, has lagged behind storage and compute developments, and has traditionally focused on individual scene processing. We present results from an ongoing effort to develop satellite imagery analysis tools that aggregate temporal, spatial, and spectral information and can scale with the high-rate and dimensionality of imagery being collected. We investigate and compare the performance of pixel-level crop identification using tree-based classifiers and its dependence on both temporal and spectral features. Classification performance is assessed using as ground-truth Cropland Data Layer (CDL) crop masks generated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The CDL maps contain 30m spatial resolution, pixel-level labels for around 200 categories of land cover, but are however only available post-growing season. The analysis focuses on McCook county in South Dakota and shows crop classification using a temporal stack of Landsat 8 (L8) imagery over the growing season, from April through October. Specifically, we consider the temporal L8 stack depth, as well as different normalized band difference indices, and evaluate their contribution to crop identification. We also show an extension of our algorithm to map corn and soy crops in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil.

AB In this paper, we envision the use of satellite images coupled with GIS to obtain location specific crop type information in order to disseminate crop specific advises to the farmers. In our ongoing mKRISHI (R) project, the accurate information about the field level crop type and acreage will help in the agro-advisory services and supply chain planning and management. The key contribution of this paper is the field level crop classification using multi temporal images of Landsat-8 acquired during November 2013 to April 2014. The study area chosen is Vani, Maharashtra, India, from where the field level ground truth information for various crops such as grape, wheat, onion, soybean, tomato, along with fodder and fallow fields has been collected using the mobile application. The ground truth information includes crop type, crop stage and GPS location for 104 farms in the study area with approximate area of 42 hectares. The seven multi-temporal images of the Landsat-8 were used to compute the vegetation indices namely: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR) and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) for the study area. The vegetation indices values of the pixels within a field were then averaged to obtain the field level vegetation indices. For each crop, binary classification has been carried out using the feed forward neural network operating on the field level vegetation indices. The classification accuracy for the individual crop was in the range of 74.5% to 97.5% and the overall classification accuracy was found to be 88.49%.

AB The fine classification of crops is critical for food security and agricultural management. There are many different species of crops, some of which have similar spectral curves. As a result, the precise classification of crops is a difficult task. Although the classification methods that incorporate spatial information can reduce the noise and improve the classification accuracy, to a certain extent, the problem is far from solved. Therefore, in this paper, the method of spatial-spectral fusion based on conditional random fields (SSF-CRF) for the fine classification of crops in UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is presented. The proposed method designs suitable potential functions in a pairwise conditional random field model, fusing the spectral and spatial features to reduce the spectral variation within the homogenous regions and accurately identify the crops. The experiments on hyperspectral datasets of the cities of Hanchuan and Honghu in China showed that, compared with the traditional methods, the proposed classification method can effectively improve the classification accuracy, protect the edges and shapes of the features, and relieve excessive smoothing, while retaining detailed information. This method has important significance for the fine classification of crops in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.

AB The demand for new tools for mass remote sensing of crops, combined with the open and free availability of satellite imagery, has prompted the development of new methods for crop classification. Because this classification is frequently required to be completed within a specific time frame, performance is also essential. In this work, we propose a new method that creates synthetic images by extracting satellite data at the pixel level, processing all available bands, as well as their data distributed over time considering images from multiple dates. With this approach, data from images of Sentinel-2 are used by a deep convolutional network system, which will extract the necessary information to discern between different types of crops over a year after being trained with data from previous years. Following the proposed methodology, it is possible to classify crops and distinguish between several crop classes while also being computationally low-cost. A software system that implements this method has been used in an area of Extremadura (Spain) as a complementary monitoring tool for the subsidies supported by the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union.

AB Due to increasing global population, the need of focusing on land cover and land uses by human beings is felt. Nowadays, most of the researchers and scientists are found showing much attention in agricultural landscapes because the effectual land-cover (LC) mapping provides the correct information regarding the land uses and land cover. Crop classification is one of the essential issues in the agriculture field because it affects the government and private agencies economically. The number of methodologies exist to classify the crop images from the remotely sensed image, but the traditional methodologies do not perform well due to some factors, like blurring effect, noise, etc. We have proposed an Adaptive Fuzzy-Centred Denoising Filter (AFDF) and Extended Elman Neural Network ((EN2)-N-2) to enhance visualization of crop image to crop classification in order to overcome traditional techniques RSI. The remote-sensing crop images have been considered in the proposed work, and the AFDF preprocesses the image to eradicate the noise. After that, the Jaccard Coefficient-based Shared Nearest Neighbour (JCSNN) segments the object as preprocessed images. The LTrP, DWT, GLCM, and shape features are extracted as the optimal features chosen by Enhanced Elephant Herding Optimization ((EHO)-H-2). Lastly, the crop is classified using the (EN2)-N-2 classifier. The high-resolution images were utilized for the experiments to validate the proposed work. At last, various techniques have been compared against the proposed system, and outcomes have shown significant enhancement in accuracy and reliability. The proposed system obtains 88.01% F-measure, 95.2% accuracy with lesser FPR values that are greater when analogized to all prevalent methods. The advantage of using proposed effective protocols, like Adaptive Fuzzy-centred Denoising Filter and also (EN2)-N-2 classifier, boost-up the crop images' visualization and also crop categorization in remote-sensing images.

Therefore, it is important to determine whether multisource sensors can obtain high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data for the target sensor with the help of the spatiotemporal fusion method. In this study, we employed three different sensor datasets to obtain one normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series dataset with a 5.8-m spatial resolution using a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). We studied the effectiveness of using multisource remote sensing data to extract crop classifications and analyzed whether the increase in the NDVI time series density could significantly improve the accuracy of the crop classification. The results indicated that multisource sensor data could be used for crop classification after spatiotemporal fusion and that the data source was not limited by the sensor platform. With the increase in the number of NDVI phases, the classification accuracy of the support vector machine (SVM) and the random forest (RF) classifier gradually improved. If the added NDVI phases were not in the optimal time period for wheat recognition, the classification accuracy was not greatly improved. Under the same conditions, the classification accuracy of the RF classifier was higher than that of the SVM. In addition, this study can serve as a good reference for the selection of the optimal time range for base image pairs in the spatiotemporal fusion method for high accuracy mapping of crops, and help avoid excessive data collection and processing.

AB Crop classification maps based on high resolution remote sensing data are essential for supporting sustainable land management. The most challenging problems for their producing are collecting of ground based training and validation datasets, non-regular satellite data acquisition and cloudiness. To increase the efficiency of ground data utilization it is important to develop classifiers able to be trained on the data collected in the previous year. In this study, we propose new deep learning method for providing crop classification maps using in-situ data that has been collected in the previous year. Main idea of the study is to utilize deep learning approach based on sparse autoencoder. At the first stage it is trained on satellite data only and then neural network fine-tuning is conducted based on in-situ data form the previous year. Taking into account that collecting ground truth data is very time consuming and challenging task, the proposed approach allows us to avoid necessity for annual collecting in-situ data for the same territory. Experimental results for the territory of Ukraine show that this technique is rather efficient and provides reliable crop classification maps with overall accuracy higher than 85.9%.

AB Food crops monitoring in developing countries such as Indonesia plays an essential role to support national goals in food security and self-sufficiency. One of the fundamental challenges is plant phase classification task which could help to estimate yield before harvest. In contrast to the conventional field survey method which required a large amount of human and capital resources, we explore a more scalable, inexpensive and real-time method using publicly available remote sensing data, i. e. Landsat-8 satellite. Landsat-8 provides rich spatiotemporal features which could support the detection of numerous vegetation and crop-related indices. However, to accurately classify the plant phase, the existing features require additional spectral pattern from different seasons. We found out the existence of temporal autocorrelation among features of food crops plant phase. The aim of this study is to propose a supervised random forest for features engineering to select the best multitemporal features for the classification of rice plant phase. In this study, we focus on the rice plant phase classification in Banyuwangi Regency, Indonesia as a case study. The ground truth data are the monthly kerangka sampel area (KSA) of average rice plant phase at the regency level which officially released by BPS-Statistics Indonesia. The experimental result shows the accuracy of 0.573 with one temporal feature. Furthermore, incorporating four consecutive temporal features gives higher accuracy gain to 0.727 which shows the temporal autocorrelation. Based on the extensive evaluations, our findings and contributions in this study include: (1) insight to capture the temporal autocorrelation to increase the model accuracy (2) a machine learning classification model which is not sensitive to multicollinearity. Our proposed method provides the potential benefit for the government and statistical agencies towards a more scalable agricultural survey.

AB The acquisition of data through remote sensing has become of great importance in precision agriculture, as it covers large geographical areas faster and cheaper than ground inspections. The challenge is to develop technical solutions that can benefit from both huge amounts of raw data extracted from satellite images, but also from the robust amount of knowledge refined during centuries of agricultural practice. Aiming to accurately classify crops from satellite images, we developed a hybrid intelligent system that can exploit both agricultural expert knowledge and machine learning algorithms. As the crop raw data is characterized by heterogeneity, we drive our attention to ensemble learners, while expert knowledge is encapsulated within a rule-based system. Vote-based methods for solving conflicts between ensemble's base learners have difficulties in classifying exceptional cases correctly and also to give the rationale behind their decision. The conceptual research question is on conflict resolution in ensemble learning. To deal with debatable cases in ensemble learning and to increase transparency in such debatable decisions, our hypothesis is that argumentation could be more effective than voting-based methods. The main contribution is that voting system in ensemble learning is substituted by an argumentation-base conflict resolutor. Prospective decisions of base classifiers are presented to an argumentative system based on defeasible logic that performs dialectical reasoning on pros and cons against a classification decision. The system computes a recommendation considering both the rules extracted from base learners and the available expert knowledge. The investigated case study deals with crop classification into four classes: corn, soybean, cotton, and rice. The test site used for the experiment is an area of 20 square kilometers in the New Madrid County, southeast of the Missouri State, USA. The results show that our approach increases classification accuracy compared to the voting-based method for conflict resolution in an ensemble learner comprising of three base classifiers: a decision tree, a neural network, and a support vector machine algorithm. We also argue that combining ensemble learning and argumentation fits the decision patterns of human agents, who first collect various opinions and then perform dialectical reasoning on these opinions. We think that the people who can benefit from the conceptual instrumentation presented in this work are decision makers in domains characterized by high data availability, robust expert knowledge, and a need for justifying the rationale behind decisions. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Information about agricultural activities and spatial land use data is one of the key input parameter for the agricultural modelling. To access and manage crop information accurately, crop rotation and production risk reduction is additionally needed. Production risk can be reduced by adopting is related to multiple interaction between phenological information and crops management techniques. We address these issues by integrating remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System through three different methods (1). Differentiation of major crop types on an annual basis using village database, (2). Classification of RS data for a time periods (May to December), which are able to differentiate the certain stages of crops and (3). Combination of multispectral multi-temporal classification results in a sequential way for analysis strategy. Crop mapping for three different seasons were mapped for three consecutive years (2016-2018) by smoothing and integrating into a single vector layer for mapping of crop rotations. The use of phonological database in our classification method shows an improvement in a classification results. The obtained database shows information about the crop rotation which is extremely heterogeneous and contains large amount of crop sequences.

AB This study investigates the potential of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) for efficient modeling of temporal information in crop classification using multitemporal remote sensing images. Unlike unidirectional LSTM models that consider only either forward or backward states, Bi-LSTM could account for temporal dependency of time-series images in both forward and backward directions. This property of Bi-LSTM can be effectively applied to crop classification when it is difficult to obtain full time-series images covering the entire growth cycle of crops. The classification performance of the Bi-LSTM is compared with that of two unidirectional LSTM architectures (forward and backward) with respect to different input image combinations via a case study of crop classification in Anbadegi, Korea. When full time-series images were used as inputs for classification, the Bi-LSTM outperformed the other unidirectional LSTM architectures; however, the difference in classification accuracy from unidirectional LSTM was not substantial. On the contrary, when using multitemporal images that did not include useful information for the discrimination of crops, the Bi-LSTM could compensate for the information deficiency by including temporal information from both forward and backward states, thereby achieving the best classification accuracy, compared with the unidirectional LSTM. These case study results indicate the efficiency of the Bi-LSTM for crop classification, particularly when limited input images are available.

AB Mapping the spatial distribution of crops has become a fundamental input for agricultural production monitoring using remote sensing. However, the multi-temporality that is often necessary to accurately identify crops and to monitor crop growth generally comes at the expense of coarser observation supports, and can lead to increasingly erroneous class allocations caused by mixed pixels. For a given application like crop classification, the spatial resolution requirement (e. g. in terms of a maximum tolerable pixel size) differs considerably over different landscapes. To analyse the spatial resolution requirements for accurate crop identification via image classification, this study builds upon and extends a conceptual framework established in a previous work1. This framework allows defining quantitatively the spatial resolution requirements for crop monitoring based on simulating how agricultural landscapes, and more specifically the fields covered by a crop of interest, are seen by instruments with increasingly coarser resolving power. The concept of crop specific pixel purity, defined as the degree of homogeneity of the signal encoded in a pixel with respect to the target crop type, is used to analyse how mixed the pixels can be (as they become coarser), without undermining their capacity to describe the desired surface properties. In this case, this framework has been steered towards answering the question: "What is the spatial resolution requirement for crop identification via supervised image classification, in particular minimum and coarsest acceptable pixel sizes, and how do these requirements change over different landscapes?" The framework is applied over four contrasting agro-ecological landscapes in Middle Asia. Inputs to the experiment were eight multi-temporal images from the RapidEye sensor, the simulated pixel sizes range from 6.5 m to 396.5 m. Constraining parameters for crop identification were defined by setting thresholds for classification accuracy and uncertainty. Different types of crops display marked individuality regarding the pixel size requirements, depending on the spatial structures and cropping pattern in the sites. The coarsest acceptable pixel sizes and corresponding purities for the same type of crop were found to vary from site to site, and some crops could not be identified using pixels coarser than 200 m.

AB Reliable and accurate crop classification maps are an important data source for agricultural monitoring and food security assessment studies. For many years, crop type classification and monitoring were focused on single-source optical satellite data classification. With advancements in sensor technologies and processing capabilities, the potential of multi-source satellite imagery has gained increasing attention. The combination of optical and radar data is particularly promising in the context of crop type classification as it allows explaining the advantages of both sensor types with respect to e.g. vegetation structure and biochemical properties. This review article gives a comprehensive overview of studies on crop type classification using optical and radar data fusion approaches. A structured review of fusion approaches, classification strategies and potential for mapping specific crop types is provided. Finally, the partially untapped potential of radar-optical fusion approaches, research gaps and challenges for upcoming future studies are highlighted and discussed.

AB Spectral library search is emerging as an automated method for exploiting finer spectral details available in hyperspectral remote sensing data. We report on the potential of transferring independent crop spectral libraries for classifying various agricultural crops using airborne hyperspectral image. Spectral libraries constructed from multi-season field reflectance measurements for five agricultural crops (alfalfa, winter barley, winter rape, winter rye, and winter wheat) are used for the per-pixel and per-field classification of HyMAP airborne hyperspectral image by the spectral library search method. Results obtained from this method are compared with the results obtained from the per-field object-oriented, and per-pixel support vector machines (SVM) supervised image classification using image-based training data. Results from the spectral library search approach (best overall accuracy: 82%) exhibit strong correlation with the results obtained from both the object-oriented and SVM-supervised classification approach. However, per-field object-oriented classification shows moderate increase in the classification performance. In spite of significant reduction in the overall accuracy, the resultant overall accuracy of about 82% obtained from the spectral library search is fairly high, given the large spatial and temporal differences maintained between the image data and the field reflectance measurements. Results indicate the existence of a meaningful spectral matching between image and reflectance library spectra for some of the crops considered, showing their potential for transferring reflectance spectral libraries for image classification. Incomplete library coverage and phenological variations are found to be the key issues that influence the prospect of transferring spectral libraries for image classification. (C) 2011 IAgrE.

AB Accurate and timely identification of crop types has significant economic, agricultural, policy, and environmental applications. The existing remote sensing methods to identify crop types rely on remotely sensed images of high temporal frequency in order to utilize phenological changes in crop reflectance characteristics. However, these image sets generally have relatively low spatial resolution. This tradeoff makes it difficult to classify remotely sensed images in fragmented landscapes where field sizes are smaller than the resolution of imaging sensor. Here, we develop a method for combining high spatial resolution (high-resolution) data with images with low spatial resolution but with high time frequency to achieve a superior classification of crop types. The solution is implemented and tested on both synthetic and real data sets as a proof of concept. We show that, by incorporating high-temporal-frequency but low spatial resolution data into the classification process, up to 20% of improvement in classification accuracy can be achieved even if very few high-resolution images are available for a location. This boost in accuracy is roughly equivalent to including an additional high-resolution image to the temporal stack during the classification process. The limitations of the current algorithm include computational performance and the need for ideal crop curves. Nevertheless, the resulting boost in accuracy can help researchers create superior crop type classification maps, thereby creating the opportunity to make more informed decisions.

AB Sugarcane crop identification and crop distribution information provides an important basis for crop acreage and yield estimation. In this study three methods i.e. object-based classification, multi-date supervised classification and knowledge-based classification methods were used for the analysis of multi-temporal LISS-III and single date LISS-IV image of Resourcesat-2A satellite. The comparison of classification results showed that planted sugarcane area overlapping was ranging from 79.30% to 91.66% and ratoon sugarcane area overlapping was ranging from 61.17% to 79.44%. Further, the classification results for planted and ratoon sugarcane at pixel levels were integrated to increase the reliability of results using the decision tree method. The integration of all the three classification results increased the overall accuracy that was 86.15% with kappa coefficient of 0.73. The use of remote sensing techniques to extract the sugarcane field information is an economically effective method that can be further used for modelling crop production in the region, forecast crop production and management of resources.

ID LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; TIME-SERIES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD
AB Precise crop classification from multi-temporal remote sensing images has important applications such as yield estimation and food transportation planning. However, the mainstream convolutional neural networks based on 2D convolution collapse the time series information. In this study, a 3D fully convolutional neural network (FCN) embedded with a global pooling module and channel attention modules is proposed to extract discriminative spatiotemporal presentations of different types of crops from multi-temporal high-resolution satellite images. Firstly, a novel 3D FCN structure is introduced to replace 2D FCNs as well as to improve current 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by providing a mean to learn distinctive spatiotemporal representations of each crop type from the reshaped multi-temporal images. Secondly, to strengthen the learning significance of the spatiotemporal representations, our approach includes 3D channel attention modules, which regulate the between-channel consistency of the features from the encoder and the decoder, and a 3D global pooling module, which selects the most distinctive features at the top of the encoder. Experiments were conducted using two data sets with different types of crops and time spans. Our results show that our method outperformed in both accuracy and efficiency, several mainstream 2D FCNs as well as a recent 3D CNN designed for crop classification. The experimental data and source code are made openly available at http://study.rsgis.whu.edu.cn/pages/download/..

AB In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical classification for winter crop mapping based on satellite imagery. A hierarchical classification is a classifier that maps input data into defined subsumptive output categories. This classification method can reduce mixed pixel effects and improve classification performance. The methodology are illustrated focus on winter crops in Gimje city, Jeonbuk with Landsat-8 imagery. First, agriculture fields were extracted from Landsat-8 imagery using Smart Farm Map. And then winter crop fields were extracted from agriculture fields using temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Finally, winter crop fields were then classified into wheat, barley, IRG, whole crop barley and mixed crop fields using signature from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The results indicate that hierarchical classifier could effectively identify winter crop fields with an overall classification accuracy of 98.99%. Thus, it is expected that the proposed classification method would be effectively used for crop mapping.

AB Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) has been widely used in the remote sensing of agricultural crops. However, issues related to image segmentation, data redundancy and performance of different classification algorithms with GEOBIA have not been properly addressed in previous studies, thereby compromising the accuracy of subsequent thematic products. It is in this regard that the current study investigates the optimal scale parameter (SP) in multi-resolution segmentation, feature subset, and classification algorithm for use in GEOBIA based on multisource satellite imagery. For this purpose, a novel supervised optimal SP selection method was proposed based on information gain ratio, and was then compared with a preexisting unsupervised optimal SP selection method. Additionally, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) and enhanced RFE (EnRFE) algorithms were modified to generate an improved EnRFE (iEnRFE) algorithm, which was then compared with its precursors in the selection of optimal classification features. Based on the above, random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to segmented objects for crop classification. The results indicated that the supervised optimal SP selection method is more suitable for application in heterogeneous land cover, whereas the unsupervised method proved more efficient as it does not require reference segmentation objects. The proposed iEnRFE method outperformed the preexisting EnRFE and RFE methods in optimal feature subset selection as it recorded the highest accuracy and less processing time. The RF, GBDT, and SVM algorithms achieved overall classification accuracies of 91.8%, 92.4%, and 90.5%, respectively. GBDT and RF recorded higher classification accuracies and utilized much less computational time than SVM and are, therefore, considered more suitable for crop classification requiring large numbers of image features. These results have shown that the proposed object-based crop classification scheme could provide a valuable reference for relevant applications of GEOBIA in crop recognition using multisource satellite imagery.

AB Basic scientific research of land cover in Suqian is fundamental to ensure the sustainability of land resource management. The major study is to monitor the confusable land cover types according to the remote sensing, and the integrated information. It supplies a new direction for integrating date sets and improves the monitor on land cover. It presents a simple fusion approach for integrating time series of the MODIS Vegetation Index products and Land-sat TM data. The fusion supplies the prior probability to distinguish forest with crop for guiding supervised classification which served in monitoring forest quantities-increasing in future. The entire operation just uses primarily the fusion method from the fuzzy mathematics to achieve various kinds of information with some simple parameters. However, the fusion is a spatial feature classification conduced remote sensing training mask data blending the advantages of the phonological information, the feature characteristics and the spatial-temporal data.

AB Deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) is popular as being widely used for classification of unstructured data. Land use land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data can be used for crop identification also. Present study aims to examine the use of deep learning CNN for LULC classification on Indian Pines dataset and for crop identification on our study area dataset. In the present work, AVIRIS sensor's Indian Pines standard dataset has been used for LULC classification. Study area from Phulambri, Aurangabad, MH, India, has been used for crop classification. Data have been gathered from EO-1 Hyperion sensor. The accuracy of CNN model depends on optimizer, activation function, filter size, learning rate and batch size. Deep learning CNN is evaluated by changing these parameters. It has been observed that deep learning CNN using optimized combination of parameters has provided 97.58% accuracy for the Indian Pines dataset, while 79.43% accuracy for our study area dataset. The empirical results demonstrate that CNN works well in practice for unstructured data as well as for small size dataset.

AB Intensive agricultural production contributes to environmental changes by acting on different factors. Protected cultivation, in particular, could be considered as a driving force that exerts pressure on the environment as the economic activity connected to it leads to changes in the state of the territory. To analyze the environmental effects of crop shelters using, for instance, causal chain frameworks as well as to adopt methodologies and tools oriented to reduce the negative effects of protected cultivation, knowledge of location and planimetric extent of crop shelters as well as their spread over time are required. This knowledge can be acquired by using and analyzing suitable thematic cartography that, if available, is often difficult to update because of the temporary character of crop shelters. Experts engaged by local authorities to carry out the visual recognition of large territories could take advantage of pattern recognition methods to reduce time-consuming operations. In this regard, methodologies for automatic acquisition of crop-shelter coverage from remote-sensing images have been proposed in some studies. Knowledge of location and planimetric area of crop shelters as well as their spread in a region is much more relevant when there are no planning tools concerning the setting of crop-shelter cultivation, and no specific regulations regarding materials and building techniques. In this paper findings of experiences on the definition and implementation of image processing methodologies based on per-pixel methods for crop-shelter classification applied to high resolution multi-spectral satellite images were analyzed and discussed. The spectral information contained into these images was analyzed and mapped through indices. The results showed that improvements of crop-shelter classification could be achieved by using this information in comparison to RGB spectral information.

AB Local parameters for climate modelling are highly dependent on crop types and their phenological growth stage. The land cover change of agricultural areas during the growing season provides important information to distinguish crop types. The presented progressive classification algorithm identifies crop types based on their phenological development and their corresponding reflectance characteristics in multitemporal satellite images of the four sensors Landsat-7 and -8, Sentinel-2A and RapidEye. It distinguishes crop types not only retrospectively, but progressively during the growing season starting in early spring. Binary fuzzy c-means clustering differentiates seven crop types in eight decisions at particular time periods. These decisions are based on expert knowledge about plant characteristics in different phenological stages. The unsupervised classification approach and previously defined decisions enable the algorithm to work independently of training data. The fuzzy approach provides certainties of crop-type existence and generates first results in early spring. The accuracy and reliability of the classification results improve with increasing time. The method is developed at the German Durable Environmental Multidisciplinary Monitoring Information Network (DEMMIN). The study area is an official test site of the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) and is located in an intensely agricultural used area in Northern Germany. Classification results were produced for the growing seasons 2015 and 2016. The overall accuracy in 2015 amounted to 89.49%. A challenge remains the distinct separation of wheat and rye, whereas barley, rapeseed, potato, corn and sugar beet are classified with high accuracies. The overall accuracy in 2016 was lower (77.19%) due to unfavourable weather conditions.

AB Many applied problems arising in agricultural monitoring and food security require reliable crop maps at national or global scale. Large scale crop mapping requires processing andmanagement of large amount of heterogeneous satellite imagery acquired by various sensors that consequently leads to a "Big Data" problem. The main objective of this study is to explore efficiency of using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform when classifying multi-temporal satellite imagery with potential to apply the platform for a larger scale (e.g., country level) and multiple sensors (e.g., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). In particular, multiple state-of-the-art classifiers available in the GEE platformare compared to produce a high resolution (30 m) crop classification map for a large territory (similar to 28,100 km(2) and 1.0 M ha of cropland). Though this study does not involve large volumes of data, it does address efficiency of the GEE platform to effectively execute complex workflows of satellite data processing required with large scale applications such as crop mapping. The study discusses strengths and weaknesses of classifiers, assesses accuracies that can be achieved with different classifiers for the Ukrainian landscape, and compares them to the benchmark classifier using a neural network approach that was developed in our previous studies. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that GEE provides very good performance in terms of enabling access to the remote sensing products through the cloud platform and providing pre-processing; however, in terms of classification accuracy, the neural network based approach outperformed support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forest classifiers available in GEE.

AB High temporal revisit frequency over vast geographic areas is necessary to properly use satellite earth observation for monitoring agricultural production. However, this often limits the spatial resolution that can be used. The challenge of discriminating pixels that correspond to a particular crop type, a prerequisite for crop specific monitoring remains daunting when the signal encoded in pixels stems from several land uses (mixed pixels). Naturally, the concept of spatial scale arises but the issue of selecting a proper class legend (the categorical scale) should not be neglected. A framework is presented that addresses these issues and that can be used to quantitatively define pixel size requirements for crop identification and to assess the effect of categorical scale. The framework was applied over two agricultural landscapes. It was demonstrated that there was no unique spatial resolution that provided the best classification result for all classes at once at a given categorical scale. The suitability of pixel populations characterized by pixel size and purity differed for identifying specific crops within tested landscapes, and for one crop there were large differences among the landscapes. In the context of agricultural crop growth monitoring the framework described above can be used to draw guidelines for selecting appropriate imagery, e.g. suitable pixel sizes, and for selecting class legends suitable for accurate crop classification when the interest is only on pixels covering arable land as a prerequisite for crop specific monitoring. The framework could be used to plot the suitability (or accuracy) of pixels as a function of their purity to provide a spatial assessment of classification performance.

AB In the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado River Accounting System (LCRAS), crop classifications derived from remote sensing are used to calculate regional estimates of crop evapotranspiration for water monitoring and management activities on the lower Colorado River basin. The LCRAS accuracy assessment was designed to quantify the impact of crop classification error on annual total crop evapotranspiration (ETc), as calculated from the Penman-Monteith method using the map crop classification as input. The accuracy assessment data were also used to generate a sample-based estimate of total ETc using the crop type identified by direct ground observation of each sample field. A stratified random sampling design was implemented using field size as the stratification variable. The stratified design did not markedly improve precision for the accuracy assessment objective, but it was highly effective for the objective of estimating ETc derived from the ground-ob served crop types. The sampling design and analysis methodology developed for LCRAS demonstrates the utility of a multi-purpose approach that satisfies the accuracy assessment objectives, but also allows for rigorous, sample-based estimates of other collective properties of a region (e.g., total ETc in this study). We discuss key elements of this multi-purpose sampling strategy and the planning process used to implement such a strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Crop type classification with satellite imageries is widely applied in support of crop production management and food security strategy. The abundant supply of these satellite data is accelerating and blooming the application of crop classification as satellite data at 10 m to 30 m spatial resolution have been made accessible easily, widely and free of charge, including optical sensors, the wide field of viewer (WFV) onboard the GaoFen (GF, high resolution in English) series from China, the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel 2 (S2) from Europe and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 (L8) from USA, thanks to the implementation of the open data policy. There are more options in using the satellite data as these three data sources are available. This paper explored the different capability of these three data sources for the crop type mapping in the same area and within the same growing season. The study was executed in a flat and irrigated area in Northwest China. Nine types of crop were classified using these three kinds of time series of data sources in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The same suites of the training samples and validation samples were applied for each of the data sources. Random Forest (RF) was used as the classifier for the crop type classification. The confusion error matrix with the OA, Kappa and F1-score was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifications. The result shows that GF-1 relatively has the lowest accuracy as a consequence of the limited spectral bands, but the accuracy is at 93-94%, which is still excellent and acceptable for crop type classification. S2 achieved the highest accuracy of 96-98%, with 10 available bands for the crop type classification at either 10 m or 20 m. The accuracy of 97-98% for L8 is in the middle but the difference is small in comparison with S2. Any of these satellite data may be used for the crop type classification within the growing season, with a very good accuracy if the training datasets were well tuned.

AB The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations predicts that in order to meet the needs of the expected 3 billion population growth by 2050, food production has to increase by 60%. Therefore, monitoring and mapping crops accurately is essential for estimating food production during each crop growing season across the globe. Traditionally, multispectral remote sensing imagery has been widely used for mapping crops worldwide. However, single date imagery does not capture temporal characteristics (phenology) of growing crops, leading to imprecise crop maps and food estimates. On the other hand, purely temporal classification approaches also produce inaccurate crop maps as they do not account for spatial autocorrelations. In this paper, we present a multimodal deep learning solution that jointly exploits spatial-spectral and phenological properties to identify major crop types. Using a two stream architecture, spatial characteristics are captured via a spatial stream consisting of very high resolution images (single date, 1m, 3-spectral bands, USDA NAIP) with a CNN and the phenological characteristics via a temporal stream images (biweekly, 250m, MODIS NDVI) with an LSTM. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal solution reduces prediction error by 60%.

AB Satellite images are highly utilized for detecting land usage, while in recent years a finer-grade crop classification has become important in the context of precision agriculture. However, such classification brings new challenges, which aside from multi-spectral images require exploitation of their multi-temporal properties as well, with pixel-based analysis and larger number of classes. In this paper, we apply several machine learning algorithms on multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite images and derive crop classification models. The models are applied only on agricultural fields, which can be singled out with the existing land usage classification models. Results show that the random forest outperforms other algorithms with accuracy score of 0.8420 and Kappa score of 0.8157. Detailed analysis of recall and precision scores is given for each crop separately, followed by a comprehensive discussion.

AB This study measures the effect of lossy image compression on the digital classification of crops and forest areas. A hybrid classification method using satellite images and other variables has been used. The results contribute interesting new data on the influence of compression on the quality of the produced cartography, both from a "by pixel" perspective and regarding the homogeneity of the obtained polygons. The classified area in classifications only carried out with radiometric variables or with NDVI and humidity (for crops) increases as image compression increases, although the increase is smaller for JPEG2000 formats and for crops. On the other hand, the classified area decreases in classifications which also take into account topoclimatic variables (for forests). Overall image accuracy diminishes at high compression ratios (CR), although the point of inflection occurs at different CR depending on the compression format. As a rule, the JPEG2000 format gives better results quantitatively for forests (accuracy and classified area) and visually (images with less "salt and pepper" effect) for both land covers.

AB A problem of crop plants classification for three regions of Ukraine with an area of 78.500 km(2) is considered. Classification is carried out using not a single satellite but a time series of satellite images. The used satellite data are characterized by different spatial resolution and temporal characteristics. By example of this problem we assessed the efficiency of different classification algorithms (neural networks, decision trees and support vector machines) for substantially different data levels (of training and testing samples) both for extremely large data sets and under the condition of their lack (absence).

AB fNowadays, Satellite images have become a major source of data for many aspects of development. Laud and crops classification using satellite images is a recent important subject. From the other side, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) is a powerful technique for understanding images. This paper describes a pixel based crops and land cover classification originating from one source satellite imagery represented by Sentinel satellite and based on several dates li)r the same agricultural season. We propose a DCNN architecture based on multi-temporal data that was fed to a one-dimension (1-I) DCNN). The proposed architecture is compared with other methods of satellite image classification algorithms; such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RI's) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NNs). Experiments are conducted for the mutual experiment of major crops and land cover classification for Al-Fayoutn governorate in Egypt. The 1-D DCNN achieves about 89% accuracy using 10 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery database tiff the area of interest. The proposed architecture although it outperforms other methods, needs further research to optimize the memory usage.

AB While annual crop rotations play a crucial role for agricultural optimization, they have been largely ignored for automated crop type mapping. In this paper, we take advantage of the increasing quantity of annotated satellite data to propose to model simultaneously the inter- and intra-annual agricultural dynamics of yearly parcel classification with a deep learning approach. Along with simple training adjustments, our model provides an improvement of over 6.3% mIoU over the current state-of-the-art of crop classification, and a reduction of over 21% of the error rate. Furthermore, we release the first large-scale multi-year agricultural dataset with over 300,000 annotated parcels.

AB Accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution of crops is of great significance to precision agriculture and food security. Many cropland mapping methods using satellite image time series are based on expert knowledge to extract phenological features to identify crops. It is still a challenge to automatically obtain meaningful features from time-series data for crop classification. In this study, we developed an automated method based on satellite image time series to map the spatial distribution of three major crops including maize, rice, and soybean in northeastern China. The core method used is the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. However, the existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique cannot handle missing data, and it is not designed for subsequent classification tasks. Therefore, the nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm Landmark-Isometric feature mapping (L-ISOMAP) is improved. The advantage of the improved L-ISOMAP is that it does not need to reconstruct time series for missing data, and it can automatically obtain meaningful featured metrics for classification. The improved L-ISOMAP was applied to Landsat 8 full-band time-series data during the crop-growing season in the three northeastern provinces of China; then, the dimensionality reduction bands were inputted into a random forest classifier to complete a crop distribution map. The results show that the area of crops mapped is consistent with official statistics. The 2015 crop distribution map was evaluated through the collected reference dataset, and the overall classification accuracy and Kappa index were 83.68% and 0.7519, respectively. The geographical characteristics of major crops in three provinces in northeast China were analyzed. This study demonstrated that the improved L-ISOMAP method can be used to automatically extract features for crop classification. For future work, there is great potential for applying automatic mapping algorithms to other data or classification tasks.

AB Real-time monitoring of agricultural crops is an important exercise because of it's huge impact on agri-business and agricultural policy management. Identification of crops during multiple crop growth stages can help formulate better agricultural policies and management strategies. In this context, the objective of this article is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery in crop classification for an Indian region. A multi-class classification algorithm based on the support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the temporal features extracted from the above mentioned satellite data sets. The experiments are conducted for Kharif and Rabi crop cycles with major crops in the region. The experiments suggest that the joint use of optical and radar imagery results in better classification accuracy compared to using them individually. An overall accuracy of 89% and 96% is obtained for Kharif and Rabi crops, respectively.

AB The HJ satellite constellation, characterized as high temporal resolution (4 day revisit frequency), has high potential to obtain cloud-free images covering all cruel periods for crop classification during growing season. In this paper, three HJ images (in May, July and September) were acquired, the performances of different multi-spectral HJ CCD data combinations for crop classification in Kashgar, Xinjiang were estimated using library for Support Vector Machine (LIBSVM), and ground reference
   data obtained in 2011 field work were used as training and validation samples. The result showed that multi-temporal HJ data has a potential to classify crops with an overall classification accuracy of 93.77%. Among the three time periods utilized in this research, the image acquired in July achieved the highest overall accuracy (86.98%) because all summer crops were under dense canopy closure. Cotton could be accurately extracted in May image (both user and produce accuracy are above 90%) because of its lower canopy closure compared with spring, the rotate crop (wheat_maize) and winter crop (wheat) at the time period. Then, the July and September combination performed as good as that of all three-time-period combination, which indicated that images obtained at cruel time periods are enough to identify crops, and the additional images improve little on classification accuracy. In addition, multi-temporal NDVI in cruel time periods of the growing season is testified efficient to classify crops with significant phenonlogical variances since they achieved similar overall accuracy to that of multi-temporal multi-spectral combination.

AB Field-scale crop monitoring is essential for agricultural management and policy making for food security and sustainability. Automating crop classification process while elaborating a workflow is a key step for reliable and precise crop mapping. This study aims to develop an approach for crop classification in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, following the specific goals of i) evaluating spatial satellite-based features to guide crop data collection; ii) testing transfer learning model with subsequent growing season data; iii) examining accuracy in early-season prediction model; and lastly, iv) developing a crop classification model for estimating large scale crop area. As main data inputs, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation data were used to extract features to input in the Random Forest classifier. Spatial variability of satellite features was evaluated using Moran's I Index and cluster k-means. Crop area prediction data were obtained at municipality level to compare with census data (standard method). A crop summer map layer was generated for three major crops: soybeans (Glycine max L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The crop classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.95. Model performance was influenced by sample size and spatial variability of the samples. The random forest model was transferred to the next growing season with 0.89 and 0.91 overall accuracy for 250 and 750 samples, respectively. However, overall accuracy increased from 0.93 to 0.95 when 50 to 250 samples of same-year data was aggregated to the model. Similar accuracy was obtained for predictions done with data until March relative to when the entire season was considered, until May. When data for more growing seasons were aggregated, the model produced more accurate early season predictions (January and February). Soybean prediction area obtained the highest performance (R-2 = 0.94), relative to rice (R-2 = 0.90) and corn (R-2 = 0.37). The rice prediction area presented a high precision, but the crop area was overestimated due to errors with wetland target relative to other class.

AB Classification methods based on Gaussian Markov Measure Field Models and other probabilistic approaches have to face the problem of construction of the likelihood. Typically, in these methods, the likelihood is computed from 1D or 3D histograms. However, when the number of information sources grows, as in the case of satellite images, the histogram construction becomes more difficult due to the high dimensionality of the feature space. In this work, we propose a generalization of Gaussian Markov Measure Field Models and provide a probabilistic segmentation scheme, which fuses multiple information sources for image segmentation. In particular, we apply the general model to classify types of crops in satellite images. The proposed method allows us to combine several feature spaces. For this purpose, the method requires prior information for building a 3D histogram for each considered feature space. Based on previous histograms, we can compute the likelihood of each site of the image to belong to a class. The computed likelihoods are the main input of the proposed algorithm and are combined in the proposed model using a contrast criteria. Different feature spaces are analyzed, among them are 6 spectral bands from LANDSAT 5 TM, 3 principal components from PCA on 6 spectral bands and 3 principal components from PCA applied on 10 vegetation indices. The proposed algorithm was applied to a real image and obtained excellent results in comparison to different classification algorithms used in crop classification.

AB Crop-type classification has been attracting a lot of attention in recent years. In particular since the launch of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite which combines a large amount of spectral and spatial information, compared to previous satellite generations. In the literature, several methods exist that perform crop classification in time series, but most of them: i) work at pixel level; ii) perform single-data analysis; and/or iii) consider a single feature. This results in low performance of state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents an approach that works at object-level and exploits both spatial and temporal information coded in NDVI time series and phenological parameters and takes advantage of a semi-supervised paradigm by combining a new hierarchical correlation clustering with an artificial neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was corroborated over an intensive cultivated area located in Barrax, Spain. Crop-type classification was compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB To provide reliable crop maps for the same territory each year, it is necessary to collect in-situ data for each year independently. Collecting ground truth data is a very time consuming and challenging task. At present, unfortunately, there is no an adopted approach, how to utilize in-situ and satellite data from previous years for crop mapping in the subsequent years. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning approach using sparse autoencoder based on only satellite data, and a further procedure of neural network fine-tuning based on in-situ data. The possibility of utilizing this deep learning architecture based on translating all available satellite data into the unified hyperspace. The study is carried out for the central part of Ukraine. Obtained results show that this technique is feasible and provides reliable crop classification maps with overall accuracy (OA) of 91.0% and 85.9% for two different experiments. The use of the proposed approach makes it possible to avoid, or decrease, the necessity for collecting in-situ data for each year and for each part of large territory.

AB The monitoring of cultivated crops and the types of different land covers is a relevant environmental and economic issue for agricultural lands management and crop yield prediction. In this context, this paper aims to use and evaluate the contribution of multisensors classification based on machine learning classifiers to crop-type identification in a semiarid area of Morocco. It is a very heterogeneous zone characterized by mixed crops (tree crops with annual crops, same crop with different phenological states during the same agricultural season, crop rotation, etc.). Therefore, such heterogeneity made the crop-type discrimination more complicated. To overcome these challenges, the present work is the first study in this area which used the fusion of high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images for land use and land cover mapping. Three machine learning classifier algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML), were applied to identify and map crop types in irrigated perimeter. In situ observations of the year 2018, for the R3 perimeter of Haouz plain in central Morocco, were used with satellite data of the same year to perform this work. The results showed that combined images acquired in C-band and the optical range improved clearly the crop-type classification performance (overall accuracy = 89%; Kappa = 0.85) compared to the classification results of optical or SAR data alone.

AB Recent access to Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) Satellite Images allows vegetation monitoring at metric and sub-metric scale, with individual trees now detectable. Therefore, it discloses new applications in precision agriculture for orchards and other tree crops.
   In this paper, we present some methodological directions for classification, and extraction of specific agricultural information from these images. Aims are tree crop detection, plot mapping, species identification, and cropping-system characterization. This latter includes for instance row management (e. g. grid vs. line pattern, width of rows and inter-rows, row orientation), crown shape, and crown size estimation.
   In this paper, we skip the segmentation step and consider that we have got a precise delimitation of plots that have a homogeneous content. To classify these plots, we have used expert knowledge in agronomy combined with image information in a decision tree.
   Classification criteria were based on parameters resulting from the Fourier transform analysis or vegetation indices, derived as one single descriptor for the whole plot.
   As a conclusion, the proposed methodology was found capable of classification and characterization of tree crops, provided the trees are clearly seen from above, and their planting is regular enough to give a response with Fourier analysis.

AB In this paper, a study on classification targeting a main production area of garlic and onion was carried out in order to figure out the applicability of multi-temporal high-resolution satellite imagery for field crop classification. After collecting satellite imagery in accordance with the growth cycle of garlic and onion, classifications using each sing date imagery and various combinations of multi-temporal dataset were conducted. In the case of single date imagery, high classification accuracy was obtained in December when the planting was completed and March when garlic and onion started to grow vigorously. Meanwhile, higher classification accuracy was obtained when using multi-temporal dataset rather than single date imagery. However, more images did not guarantee higher classification accuracy. Rather, the imagery at the planting season or right after planting reduced classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy was obtained when using the combination of March, April and May data corresponding the growth season of garlic and onion. Therefore, it is recommended to secure imagery at main growth season in order to classify garlic and onion field using multi-temporal satellite imagery.

Both optical (EO-1/ALI) and SAR (RADARSAT-2) images are used in order to assess impact adding SAR images for classification purposes. Three different classifiers, in particular neural networks, support vector machine and decision trees, are applied with neural networks giving the best overall accuracy. It is found that major impact of using SAR images is for sunflower and sugar beet classes while there was no gain for other crops (maize and soybeans).

Annual monitoring and crop classification will be used to calculate the nutrient balance on field level. To avoid ecological risks it is necesary to calculate nutrient balance in consideration to landscape properties. Therefore, it will be shown how satellite remote sensing can improve risk assessment of enlarged regions, when it is interpreted with a balance model using GIS. The results of balance models supported by remote sensed imagery gives a spatial base to land information and planning systems on regional scale.

AB This paper presents a review of the conducted research in the field of multitemporal classification methods used for the automatic identification of crops and arable land using optical satellite images. The review and systematization of these methods in terms of the effectiveness of the obtained results and their accuracy allows for the planning towards further development in this area. The state of the art analysis concerns various methodological approaches, including selection of data in terms of spatial resolution, selection of algorithms, as well as external conditions related to arable land use, especially the structure of crops. The results achieved with use of various approaches and classifiers and subsequently reported in the literature vary depending on the crops and area of analysis and the sources of satellite data. Hence, their review and systematic conclusions are needed, especially in the context of the growing interest in automatic processes of identifying crops for statistical purposes or monitoring changes in arable land. The results of this study show no significant difference between the accuracy achieved from different machine learning algorithms, yet on average artificial neural network classifiers have results that are better by a few percent than others. For very fragmented regions, better results were achieved using Sentinel-2, SPOT-5 rather than Landsat images, but the level of accuracy can still be improved.

AB Image classification is one of the crucial techniques in detecting the crops from remotely sensed data. Crop identification and discrimination provide an important basis for many agricultural applications with various purposes, such as cropping pattern analysis, acreage estimation, and yield estimation. Accurate and faster estimation of crop area is very essential for projecting yearly agriculture production for deciding agriculture policies. Remote sensing is a technique that allows mapping of large areas in a fast and economical way. In many applications of remote sensing, a user is often interested in identifying the specific crop only while other classes may be of no interest. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) LISS IV sensor image of spatial resolution 5.8 m has been used to identify the sugarcane crop for the Chhapar village of Muzaffarnagar District, India. Classification of satellite data is one of the primary steps for information extraction for crop land identification. In recent years, decision tree approach to image analysis has been developed for the assessment and improvement of traditional statistically based image classification. In this study, ISODATA, MLC, and vegetation indices based decision tree approaches are used for classifying LISS IV imagery. The 11 vegetation index images have been generated for decision tree classification. All the three methods are compared and it is found that the best performance is given by the decision tree method. Vegetation indices based decision tree method for sugarcane classification, the user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient were found 88.17, 86.59, and 87.93% and 0.86 respectively.

AB Recent satellite missions have provided new perspectives by offering high spatial resolution, a variety of spectral properties, and fast revisit rates to the same regions. In this study, we examined the utility of both broadband red-edge spectral information and texture features for classifying paddy rice crops in South Korea into three different growth stages. The rice grown in South Korea can be grouped into early-maturing, medium-maturing, and medium-late-maturing cultivars, and each cultivar is known to have a minimum and maximum productivity. Therefore, the accurate classification of paddy rice crops into a certain time line enables pre-estimation of the expected rice yields. For the analysis, two seasons of RapidEye satellite image data were used. The results showed that the broadband red-edge information slightly improved the classification accuracy of the paddy rice crops, particularly when single-season image data were used. In contrast, texture information resulted in only minor improvement or even a slight decline in accuracy, although it is known to be advantageous for object-based classification. This was due to the homogeneous nature of paddy rice fields, as different rice cultivars are similar in terms of their morphology. Based on these results, we conclude that the additional spectral information such as the red-edge band is more useful than the texture features to detect different crop conditions in relatively homogeneous rice paddy environments. We therefore confirm the potential of broadband red-edge information to improve the classification of paddy rice crops. However, there is still a need to examine the relationship between textural properties and paddy rice crop parameters in greater depth.

AB The HJ satellite constellation is designed for environment and disaster monitoring by the Chinese government. This paper investigates the performance of multitemporal multispectral charge-coupled device (CCD) data on board HJ-1-A and HJ-1-B for crop classification in the North China Plain. Support vector machine classifier is selected for the classification using different combinations of multitemporal HJ multispectral data. The results indicate that multitemporal HJ CCD data could effectively identify wheat fields with an overall classification accuracy of 91.7%. Considering only single temporal data, 88.2% is the best classification accuracy achieved using the data acquired at the flowering time of wheat. The performance of the combination of two temporal data acquired at the jointing and flowering times of wheat is almost as well as using all three temporal data, indicating that two appropriate temporal data are enough for wheat classification, and much more data have little effect on improving the classification accuracy. Moreover, two temporal data acquired over a larger time interval achieves better results than that over a smaller interval. However, the field borders and smaller cotton fields cannot be identified effectively by HJ multispectral data, and misclassification phenomenon exists because of the relatively coarse spatial resolution.

AB A timely inventory of agricultural areas and crop types is an essential requirement for ensuring global food security and allowing early crop monitoring practices. Satellite remote sensing has proven to be an increasingly more reliable tool to identify crop types. With the Copernicus program and its Sentinel satellites, a growing source of satellite remote sensing data is publicly available at no charge. Here, we used joint Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to create a crop map for Belgium. To ensure homogenous radar and optical inputs across the country, Sentinel-1 12-day backscatter mosaics were created after incidence angle normalization, and Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were smoothed to yield 10-daily cloud-free mosaics. An optimized random forest classifier predicted the eight crop types with a maximum accuracy of 82% and a kappa coefficient of 0.77. We found that a combination of radar and optical imagery always outperformed a classification based on single-sensor inputs, and that classification performance increased throughout the season until July, when differences between crop types were largest. Furthermore, we showed that the concept of classification confidence derived from the random forest classifier provided insight into the reliability of the predicted class for each pixel, clearly showing that parcel borders have a lower classification confidence. We concluded that the synergistic use of radar and optical data for crop classification led to richer information increasing classification accuracies compared to optical-only classification. Further work should focus on object-level classification and crop monitoring to exploit the rich potential of combined radar and optical observations.

AB We developed and tested an operational methodology to map agricultural crops from the classification of RADARSAT and Landsat TM spectral and texture data in southeast Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The main crops of interest were wheat (in winter) and corn, sunflower and potato (in summer). The crops rotate with pasture for livestock every 4-5 years, creating a high spatial heterogeneity in the land use and land cover characteristics. Me used RADARSAT data (SGF W2 Ascending, 10 July, and 7 November 1997) and textural derivatives obtained from co-occurrence matrices in combination with optical satellite data (Landsat TM - bands 3, 4 and 5, 27 November 1997). Standard methods for georectification, backscatter calculation and texture calculation were employed. Training and test areas were selected based on field surveys, and a supervised classification was performed using the maximum likelihood decision rule. The mapping results indicate that RADARSAT tone and texture data provide a superior classification result (approximately 10% better) when compared to the use of Landsat TM data alone in the decision rule. The overall classification accuracy was approximately 62% correct (95% Confidence Interval = 57.8% - 66.5%). Of principal interest was the wheat class, which was determined to be approximately 81% correct.

AB Forecasting of crop production is one of the most important aspects of agricultural statistics system. Crop production forecasting comprises crop identification, area estimation and predicting the yield of the crop. Crop acreages are estimated using current season's Indian Remote Sensing Satellite data. Stratified Random Sampling approach and supervised classification of Satellite digital data has been adopted for district-level acreage estimation. In this procedure, using ground based observations collected synchronous to satellite passes, the various crops along with other vegetation classes are identified on the satellite data and spectral signatures are generated for supervised classification. The sample segments are classified using these spectral signatures and crop acreages in the district are estimated using standard statistical aggregation procedures. The Quality Assessment (QA) of district-level acreage estimates is evaluated based on the ground truth data collected in the sample segments. To estimate wheat yields in the study districts, zonal spectral-trend-agrometeorological (agromet) model has been generated using the statistical method of factor analysis. The study has been conducted for zone-II comprising of Karnal, Kaithal, Jind, Panipat, Sonipat and Rohtak districts of Haryana state. Remote sensing based wheat acreage and model predicted yields have been compared with Department of Agriculture (DOA) estimates by computing percent relative deviation. Zonal model developed on the basis of time series data from 1978-79 to 2000-01 has been used to predict the wheat yields for the period 2001-02 to 2007-08. The overall results indicate that the integration of remote sensing data with trend based yield and weather variables provides an immense scope to improve the efficiency and reliability of wheat yield forecasts. Zonal yield models provided considerable improvement in the district-level yield forecasts by showing good agreement with the real time data.

AB Accuracy assessment procedures are usually recommended in land-use/land-cover change studies to ascertain the quality of thematic maps produced by means of automated image classification methods. In this regard, the error matrix and accompanying accuracy measures (AMs) are widely used. Concerning thematic maps of crop-shelter coverage (CSC), high-resolution remote sensing images have been found to be suitable for the automated classification of greenhouses and several methodologies have been developed. However, methods to report the thematic map accuracy derived from these classifications still need to be standardized. Therefore, this study was undertaken with the aim to provide guidelines for determining a set of AMs suitable to report the accuracy of CSC thematic maps produced at local scale. In the case study, QuickBird RGB-band layers were combined with textural information computed on degraded QuickBird panchromatic layer to perform CSC supervised classifications in a study area located in South-Eastern Sicily (Italy) where protected cultivation is widespread. Statistical tests were performed on a number of AMs computed on the error matrices obtained from the automated image classifications of three different areas selected within the study area. The results of this study showed that user's accuracy was not influenced by the area selection and, therefore, can be used to report the accuracy of CSC thematic maps obtained by automated image classifications of other areas located within the study area. All the obtained classifications differed from a random one; and the use of textural information generally improved classifications' accuracy in comparison to that obtained by using only ROB-band layers.

AB The monitoring of agricultural areas in Cyprus provides important data for efficient water supply plans and for avoiding unnecessary water lost due to inefficient irrigation. In this context, satellite remote sensing techniques may be useful as an efficient tool for monitoring agricultural areas. The objective of this study is to present the overall methodology for monitoring agricultural areas and estimating the irrigation demand in Cyprus using satellite remote sensing, irrigation models and other auxiliary data. Field spectro-radiometric measurements using SVC-HR 1024 and GER 1500 were undertaken to determine the spectral signature of different types of crops so as to assist our classification techniques. Final crop maps using Landsat TM and ETM+ can be produced and the optimal amount of irrigation demand required for certain types of crops can be determined in order to avoid any non-effective water management. This paper presents the overall methodology of the proposed research study designed to enable the implementation of an integrated approach by combining satellite remote sensing, irrigation models, micro-sensor technology and in-situ spectroradiometric measurements to determine the irrigation demand and finally to validate our results.

AB Ukraine is one of the most developed agricultural countries in the world. For many applications, it is extremely important to provide reliable crop maps taking into account diversity of cropping systems used in Ukraine. The use of optical imagery only is limited due to cloud cover, and previous studies showed particular difficulties in discriminating summer crops in Ukraine such as maize, soybeans, sunflower, and sugar beet. This paper focuses on exploring feasibility and assessing efficiency of using multitemporal satellite synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) acquired in C-band and optical images for crop classification in Ukraine. Both optical (Landsat-8/OLI) and SAR (Radarsat-2) images are used to assess the impact of adding backscattering intensity from SAR images for classification purposes. SAR intensity information is very important due to availability of Sentinel-1 imagery over Ukraine starting March 2015. Different combinations of optical and SAR images, as well as SAR modes and polarizations, are assessed for better discrimination of crops. A committee of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is used to improve classification accuracy compared to several standard classifiers. It is found that using backscatter coefficients from SAR images alone provides the same performance for winter crops (wheat and rapeseed) as surface reflectance from optical images. Considering the summer crops, the major impact of adding backscatter intensity information from SAR images is in better separation of sunflower, soybeans, and maize.

AB The spatial distribution of crops is an important agricultural parameter, which is used to derive important information about crop productivity and food security. However, crop mapping on a large scale is challenging due to the low spatio-temporal information of satellite data, sparse sampling, and poor computational efficiency for massive data. To alleviate these problems, this study proposes a method based on discrete grids with machine learning to integrate GaoFen-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. First, the proposed method fuses multi-source satellite data with similar observation characteristics to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of satellites. Second, a data augmentation technique based on a discrete grid framework was proposed to solve the problem of sparse samples. Finally, a machine learning algorithm in a discrete grid was introduced to improve processing efficiency and ensure the crop classification precision of large-scale remote sensing images. An experiment in the Sanjiang Plain area (approximately 108900 km2) of Northeast China showed that the proposed scheme benefited from a high spatio-temporal multi-source dataset and achieved good performance. Compared with a single data source, the accuracy of crop mapping using multi-source optical remote sensing data is higher, attaining up to 86 and 88 % in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Furthermore, the advantages of machine learning in discrete grids over largescale areas are validated by evaluating the accuracy of different classifiers, which indicates the suitability of discrete grids in data augmentation and large-scale crop mapping. Finally, discrete grid technology offers a possibility for crop mapping over large-scale areas, and improves the processing efficiency of remote sensing big data. The findings in this study can contribute to studies on large-scale crop classification and serve as a reference to them.

AB The study of agriculture and agricultural production is an important part of planning for allocation of resources and economic forecasting. The prediction of crop output requires collecting accurate crop data through-out the growing season, in locations with a wide range of climatic conditions. To ensure the accurate estimation for forecasting the harvests and crop insurance; the type of crop and area should be regularly measured all through the year. Moreover, crop classification by remote sensing data is becoming more important. With the help of Satellite image time series (SITS) and number of classification approaches there are more chances of efficient crop classification. This proposal intends to rectify some of the issues like crop similarity, salt and pepper noise that obtained in crop classification process.

AB Hailstorms cause enormous physical damage in agriculture, often result in disasters leading to widespread, sudden loss in harvestable produce, and at times entire loss to grownup orchards. Accurate area-wide crop damage assessment is a challenging task to provide timely relief to farmers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multispectral satellite data for mapping crop-damaged area, identification of hailstreaks, their ground track attributes using NDVI difference of pre and post-hailstorm events. Crop classification within hailstreak was performed using a multispectral, high resolution LISS-IV satellite data from IRS-Resourcesat-2. Six hailstorm-damaged streaks were examined in the study area, varying in width ranging from 3 to 8 km, and length ranging from 6 to 33 km. Maximum area damaged was in grapes, followed by sugarcane and papaya. Changes in NDVI profile of different crops in the study area was recorded, and a model was developed for estimating changes in NDVI due to hail damage. The crop classification error matrix indicated Kappa Coefficient (0.55) with an overall classification accuracy of 69.6%. This study discusses the potential of high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data for crop damage assessment in the aftermath of the hailstorms.

AB This paper presents a new hierarchical clustering algorithm for crop stage classification using hyperspectral satellite image. Amongst the multiple benefits and uses of remote sensing, one of the important application is to solve the problem of crop stage classification. Modern commercial imaging satellites, owing to their large volume of satellite imagery, offer greater opportunities for automated image analysis. Hence, we propose a unsupervised algorithm namely Hierarchical Artificial Immune System (HAIS) of two steps: splitting the cluster centers and merging them. The high dimensionality of the data has been reduced with the help of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The classification results have been compared with K-means and Artificial Immune System algorithms. From the results obtained, we conclude that the proposed hierarchical clustering algorithm is accurate.

AB Feed and fodder comprises about 65% of the cost of milk production of a dairy industry. It is a crucial input for enhancing the milk production. To address the issue of fodder availability at first, its assessment is required. Thus, we have implemented remote sensing technique for fodder crop assessment at state level to create a baseline for fodder crop availability for dairy managers to plan for its procurement during deficit and for better management purposes during its excess. We have devised a technique for remote sensing-based fodder crop assessment based on spectral pattern of growth, i.e. normalised difference vegetation index profile and land surface wetness index profile of series of IRS LISS-III satellite data taken during the crop growth cycle for a hybrid method of crop classification. Second objective to address the issue of mitigating the deficit of fodder crops, we have demonstrated the satellite derived intersection of probable high soil wetness area and available current fallows during a crop growing season which can be utilised for growing fodder crops. For macro-level planning in a state for developing new fodder-growing areas, we have demonstrated the availability of soil wetness factor from SMAP data. Fallow land available between two cropping seasons can be identified through remote sensing for growing short duration fast growing fodder crops. This project has been a demonstration project for AMUL in Gujarat to implement it subsequently at national level.

AB Satellite imagery data have been used for over two decades for monitoring agricultural condition, progress and productivity at global, regional and local scales. Applications derived from medium spatial resolution (<80m) remotely sensed data could be used to assess field-level crop conditions and productivity throughout the growing season. The development of these applications depends on the ability to accurately separate and classify various crop types. However, the accuracy obtained using conventional statistical classification technique, which allocates each image pixel to a particular land cover class, is often unsatisfactory when remote sensing data contains mixed pixels. Fuzzy logic can represent geographical phenomena better than conventional statistical technique, by allocating a pixel to all land cover classes with a grade of membership. Multi-temporal imagery can greatly improve crop type classification because differences in the phenological development state of each crop are more apparent in later periods, thus allowing for more accurate classification of different crop types. This article evaluates the use of fuzzy classification technique, Penalized Fuzzy c-means algorithm, using multi-temporal satellite imagery to classify paddy, semi-dry and sugarcane crops in Bhadra command area, Karnataka, India. Using a multi-date classification, paddy and semi-dry crops are classified with 91% and 95% accuracies, respectively. Perennial crop, sugarcane, is also discriminated from the other crops by using multi date NDVI imageries.

AB Accurate land use / land cover classification (LU/LC) of agricultural crops still represents a major challenge for multispectral remote sensing. In order to obtain reliable classification accuracies on the basis of multispectral satellite data, merging crop classes in rather broad classes is often necessary. With regard to the rising availability and the improving spatial resolution of satellite data, multitemporal analyses become increasingly important for remote sensing investigations. For the separation of spectrally similar crops, multidate satellite images include different growth characteristics during the phenological period. The present study aims at investigating a way to perform highly accurate classifications with numerous agricultural classes using multitemporal Rapid Eye data. The Jeffries-Matusita separability (JM) was used for applying a pre-procedure in order to find the best multitemporal setting of all available images within one crop cycle, consisting of two cultivation periods P1 with 16 agricultural classes and P2 with 27 agricultural classes. Only one critical class pairing occurred for both PI and P2 taking into account the best multitemporal dataset. The maximum likelihood (ML) classifier and the support vector machine (SVM) were compared using the most suitable multitemporal images. Both algorithms achieved very high overall accuracies (OAA) of over 90%. SVM was slightly better with a classification accuracy of P1-OAA = 96.13% and P2-OAA = 94.01%. ML provided a result of OAA = 94.83% correctly classified pixels for P1 and OAA = 93.28% for P2. The processing time of ML, however, was significantly shorter compared to SVM, in fact by a factor of five.

AB Accurate crop-type maps are urgently needed as input data for various applications, leading to improved planning and more sustainable use of resources. Satellite remote sensing is the optimal tool to provide such data. Images from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensors are preferably used as they work regardless of cloud coverage during image acquisition. However, processing of SAR is more complicated and the sensors have development potential. Dealing with such a complexity, current studies should aim to be reproducible, open, and built upon free and open-source software (FOSS). Thereby, the data can be reused to develop and validate new algorithms or improve the ones already in use. This paper presents a case study of crop classification from microwave remote sensing, relying on open data and open software only. We used 70 multitemporal microwave remote sensing images from the Sentinel-1 satellite. A high-resolution, high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) assisted the preprocessing. The multi-data approach (MDA) was used as a framework enabling to demonstrate the benefits of including external cadastral data. It was used to identify the agricultural area prior to the classification and to create land use/land cover (LULC) maps which also include the annually changing crop types that are usually missing in official geodata. All the software used in this study is open-source, such as the Sentinel Application Toolbox (SNAP), Orfeo Toolbox, R, and QGIS. The produced geodata, all input data, and several intermediate data are openly shared in a research database. Validation using an independent validation dataset showed a high overall accuracy of 96.7% with differentiation into 11 different crop-classes.

AB Crop type classification using remote sensing data plays a vital role in planning cultivation activities and for optimal usage of the available fertile land. Thus a reliable and precise classification of agricultural crops can help improve agricultural productivity. Hence in this paper a gene expression programming based fuzzy logic approach for multiclass crop classification using Multispectral satellite image is proposed. The purpose of this work is to utilize the optimization capabilities of GEP for tuning the fuzzy membership functions. The capabilities of GEP as a classifier is also studied. The proposed method is compared to Bayesian and Maximum likelihood classifier in terms of performance evaluation. From the results we can conclude that the proposed method is effective for classification.

AB Crop planting area and spatial distribution information have important practical significance for food security, global change, and sustainable agricultural development. How to efficiently and accurately identify crops in a timely manner by remote sensing in order to determine the crop planting area and its temporal-spatial dynamic change information is a core issue of monitoring crop growth and estimating regional crop yields. Based on hundreds of relevant documents from the past 25 years, in this paper, we summarize research progress in relation to farmland vegetation identification and classification by remote sensing. The classification and identification of farmland vegetation includes classification based on vegetation index, spectral bands, multi-source data fusion, artificial intelligence learning, and drone remote sensing. Representative studies of remote sensing methods are collated, the main content of each technology is summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Current problems related to crop remote sensing identification are then identified and future development directions are proposed.

AB Image classification is a compulsory step in any remote sensing research. Classification uses the spectral information represented by the digital numbers in one or more spectral bands and attempts to classify each individual pixel based on this spectral information. Crop classification is the main concern of remote sensing applications for developing sustainable agriculture system. Vegetation indices computed from satellite images gives a good indication of the presence of vegetation. It is an indicator that describes the greenness, density and health of vegetation. Texture is also an important characteristics which is used to identifying objects or region of interest is an image. This paper illustrate the use of decision tree method to classify the land in to crop land and non-crop land and to classify different crops. In this paper we evaluate the possibility of crop classification using an integrated approach methods based on texture property with different vegetation indices for single date LISS IV sensor 5.8 meter high spatial resolution data. Eleven vegetation indices (NDVI, DVI, GEMI, GNDVI, MSAVI2, NDWI, NG, NR, NNIR, OSAVI and VI green) has been generated using green, red and NIR band and then image is classified using decision tree method. The other approach is used integration of texture feature (mean, variance, kurtosis and skewness) with these vegetation indices. A comparison has been done between these two methods. The results indicate that inclusion of textural feature with vegetation indices can be effectively implemented to produce classified maps with 8.33% higher accuracy for Indian satellite IRS-P6, LISS IV sensor images.

AB Earth observation (EO) data is effective in monitoring agricultural cropping activity over large areas. An example of such an application is the GeoTerraImage crop type classification for the South African Crop Estimates Committee (CEC). The satellite based classification of crop types in South Africa provides a large scale, spatial and historical record of agricultural practices in the main crop growing areas. The results from these classifications provides data for the analysis of trends over time, in order to extract valuable information that can aid decision making in the agricultural sector. Crop cultivation practices change over time as farmers adapt to demand, exchange rate and new technology. Through the use of remote sensing, grain crop types have been identified at field level since 2008, providing a historical data set of cropping activity for the three most important grain producing provinces of Mpumalanga, Freestate and North West province in South Africa. This historical information allows the analysis of farm management practices to identify changes and trends in crop rotation and irrigation practices. Analysis of crop type classification over time highlighted practices such as: frequency of cultivation of the same crop on a field, intensified cultivation on centre pivot irrigated fields with double cropping of a winter grain followed by a summer grain in the same year and increasing cultivation of certain types of crops over time such as soyabeans. All these practices can be analysed in a quantitative spatial and temporal manner through the use of the remote sensing based crop type classifications.

DE ENVISAT; ASAR; rice crop identification; object oriented classifier
AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is anticipated to be the dominant high-resolution remote sensing data source for agricultural applications in tropical and subtropical regions due to its independent from cloud cover. ENVISAT-I ASAR is the most advanced satellite radar-imaging instrument, its capabilities include beam steering for acquiring images with different incidence angle:3, duel polarization and wide swath coverage. Agricultural crop inventory based on remote sensed data will be improved greatly by ASAR's new capabilities. In this paper, multi-temporal ASAR alternative polarization data are used for the identification of rice crop in Fujian province. A procedure has been developed using multi-date ASAR data for rice crop identification. The procedure comprises two parts: data preprocessing and classification of multi-date data for rice field. Some novel methods are applied in image preprocessing such as correlation matching for image co-registration and multi-channel filtering for speckle suppression. Object-oriented classifier was used for classification. By adopting the procedure, classification accuracy of 90% was achieved in the test sites with multi-temporal Envisat ASAR data.

AB Italy is considered one of the developed country in the field of agriculture in Europe. For many reasons, reliable classification of crops and mapping plays an important role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Increasing availability, improving spatial resolution and high revisit time of sentinel-2 satellite become more useful and play an important role in analyses for land cover, crop classification and other remote sensing applications. Most of the Crops with similar spectral characteristics can be distinguished by accumulating spectral information of different phenological stages. In literature, many solutions have been proposed to classify crops using multitemporal images acquired from various satellites equipped with multispectral imagery sensors. However, features and images selection from multispectral, multitemporal images still needs improvement. In this paper, crops phenological cycles are investigated using temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) patterns and major crop phenological information are used to select best multitemporal images for the input of random forest (RF) classifier to classify land cover and crops.

AB Garlic and winter wheat are major economic and grain crops in China, and their boundaries have increased substantially in recent decades. Updated and accurate garlic and winter wheat maps are critical for assessing their impacts on society and the environment. Remote sensing imagery can be used to monitor spatial and temporal changes in croplands such as winter wheat and maize. However, to our knowledge, few studies are focusing on garlic area mapping. Here, we proposed a method for coupling active and passive satellite imagery for the identification of both garlic and winter wheat in Northern China. First, we used passive satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images) to extract winter crops (garlic and winter wheat) with high accuracy. Second, we applied active satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 images) to distinguish garlic from winter wheat. Third, we generated a map of the garlic and winter wheat by coupling the above two classification results. For the evaluation of classification, the overall accuracy was 95.97%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.94 by eighteen validation quadrats (3 km by 3 km). The user's and producer's accuracies of garlic are 95.83% and 95.85%, respectively; and for the winter wheat, these two accuracies are 97.20% and 97.45%, respectively. This study provides a practical exploration of targeted crop identification in mixed planting areas using multisource remote sensing data.

AB One of the approaches of estimating crop evapotranspiration over large areas using remote sensing is the use of canopy reflectance (vegetation indices) derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery to estimate and update evapotranspiration crop coefficients. When this method is applied after the irrigation season is over, a spectral crop classification using one or more of the images can be conducted to produce a crop type map of the entire area, allowing the application of the appropriate crop coefficients on a field-by-field basis. However, if the application is to be run in real-time during an irrigation season using satellite images as they become available, a different classification scheme is required as early season images might not be optimally suited for a traditional spectral classification. This paper presents a real-time method of classification based on a combination of spectral classification and logic using the prior knowledge of the crop types and growth curves in the region. The method is applied to images acquired every two weeks over the 2004 irrigation season at the Lebrija Irrigation District on the Guadalquivir River in Southern Spain. Ground truth information was provided by the local irrigation district.

AB The multitemporal observation capability of remote sensing satellites is of increasing importance in crop monitoring. Nowadays we can obtain dense multitemporal data more easily because more and more Earth observation satellites are put into use. Multiband images derived from different satellite sensors usually have different spatial resolutions, and how to utilize different spatial resolution information of multisensors in multitemporal sequence is of great significance. In this paper, we propose a crop classification network based on interleaved group convolution for multitemporal multisensor data. Firstly, we selected the Central Valley of California as research area with rich crop categories. And multitemporal sequence of length 65 in this region was obtained from satellites Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8. Then, to coordinate the sensors with different spatialspectral acquisition parameters, we convolve different bands of sensors to perform multiresolution fusion, and then further align the spectral dimensions. The interleaved group convolution, which has comparable model performance and fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than regular convolution, is introduced to reduce network parameters and reduce the computational complexity of multitemporal classification. Experimental results on our proposed multitemporal multisensor dataset have proved that our method has better performance in crop classification compared with traditional methods. And compared with regular convolution, our method can achieve roughly equivalent classification accuracy.

AB This study used archived remote sensing images to depict the history of changes in soil salinity in the Hetao Irrigation District in Inner Mongolia, China, with the purpose of linking these changes with land and water management practices and to draw lessons for salinity control. Most data came from LANDSAT satellite images taken in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006. In these years salt-affected areas were detected using a normal supervised classification method. Corresponding cropped areas were detected from NVDI ( Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values using an unsupervised method. Field samples and agricultural statistics were used to estimate the accuracy of the classification. Historical data concerning irrigation/drainage and the groundwater table were used to analyze the relation between changes in soil salinity and land and water management practices. Results showed that: (1) the overall accuracy of remote sensing in detecting soil salinity was 90.2%, and in detecting cropped area, 98%; (2) the installation/innovation of the drainage system did help to control salinity; and (3) a low ratio of cropped land helped control salinity in the Hetao Irrigation District. These findings suggest that remote sensing is a useful tool to detect soil salinity and has potential in evaluating and improving land and water management practices.

AB Among the multiple advantages and applications of remote sensing, one of the most important uses is to solve the problem of crop classification, i.e., differentiating between various crop types. Satellite images are a reliable source for investigating the temporal changes in crop cultivated areas. In this letter, we propose a novel bat algorithm (BA)-based clustering approach for solving crop type classification problems using a multispectral satellite image. The proposed partitional clustering algorithm is used to extract information in the form of optimal cluster centers from training samples. The extracted cluster centers are then validated on test samples. A real-time multispectral satellite image and one benchmark data set from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository are used to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The performance of the BA is compared with two other nature-inspired metaheuristic techniques, namely, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The performance is also compared with the existing hybrid approach such as the BA with K-means. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the BA can be successfully applied to solve crop type classification problems.

AB Remote sensing image scene classification is one of the hottest topics in high spatial resolution remote sensing image understanding.The complexity of spatial distribution and structure patterns of objects in high resolution remote sensing images make the problem challenging.Deep learning methods represented by convolutional neural networks have powerful feature learning capabilities and perform well in scene classification tasks of remote sensing images. Inspired by spatial transformer network (STN), this paper proposes an effective remote sensing image scene classification network the Spatial Transformer Fusion Network (STFN), which applies the spatial transformer network to remote sensing image scene classification task.The structure of STFN uses spatial transformer network to crop remote sensing images to extract the attention areas.Then, STFN extracts features of original images and the cropped images and finally fuse them.Experiments and evaluations are performed on two public remote sensing image datasets: the UC Merced Land-Use dataset with 21 scene categories and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset with 45 scene categories.Results of experiments show that the proposed method has a relatively simple network structure and can produce competitive classification performance.

AB Accurate pesticide exposure estimation is integral to epidemiologic studies elucidating the role of pesticides in human health. Humans can be exposed to pesticides via residential proximity to agricultural pesticide applications (drift). We present an improved geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing method, the Landsat method, to estimate agricultural pesticide exposure through matching pesticide applications to crops classified from temporally concurrent Landsat satellite remote sensing images in California. The image classification method utilizes Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in a combined maximum likelihood classification and per-field (using segments) approach. Pesticide exposure is estimated according to pesticide-treated crop fields intersecting 500 m buffers around geocoded locations (e.g., residences) in a GIS. Study results demonstrate that the Landsat method can improve GIS-based pesticide exposure estimation by matching more pesticide applications to crops (especially temporary crops) classified using temporally concurrent Landsat images compared to the standard method that relies on infrequently updated land use survey (WS) crop data, The Landsat method can be used in epidemiologic studies to reconstruct past individual-level exposure to specific pesticides according to where individuals are located.

AB For the most population in the world, it is very important to estimate the yield of crops in China on Remote Sensing by satellite. For the complicated natural condition in China, there are many different crops and cultivation systems. We must divide it into different regions. On the base of regionalisation, we chose sample spots, monitored on spot, and compared with satellite images of NOAA, Landsat TM, and SPOT. We gain crops areas by fuzzy supervision classification, and gain yield by unitage yield model. Considered the influence of disaster (flood, drought, and typhoon), we can forecast the crop yields in 3 or 4 weeks before harvesting.
   In China crop yield estimation has been done for 10 years. We had formed a running system for wheat. Its precision is reached 98%. The corn is distributed in north provinces, its estimation precision is reached 90%, and the corn system will be run in whole country. The rice is distributed in south provinces. We can forecast the yield of the provinces of Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei. For many mountains and cloudy in Sichuan province, we must do more works for it. The system of Chinese crop yield estimation on remote sensing has done many works for management of national crops product, crop transportation, and crops future market. We also do some work for circumjacent country.

AB This paper mainly, discusses a specific classification which is used to acquire the agricultural crop layout with the remote sensing data. The remote sensing image classification is the key technique to advance the precision of acquiring the information. We proposed that the precision of the classification and the speed of calculation can be improved by the Back Propagation Neural Network Model, and the advanced model can be used to acquire the agricultural crop layout with the remote sensing information as well. The experiment result presents that, compared with general methods, this new classification can effectively advance the precision of acquire agricuftural crop layout, and it can partially resolve the problem of the different crop types with the same spectrums or the same type with different spectrum.

AB Monitoring changes in paddy area is important for economic and environment research since rice is staple food in Asia, and paddy agriculture is a major cropping system in Asia. Recently, remote sensing is used actively to observe the change of paddy area. However, monitoring paddy area by remote sensing is difficult due to the temporal changes of paddy and difference of spatiotemporal characteristics of paddy agriculture between countries or regions. In our previous research using MLP and spatiotemporal satellite sensor data, the proposed classifier yielded 90.8% correct classification rate. In this paper, we proposed a cooperative learning method using PSO as the global search method and MLP as the local search method in order to improve the classification accuracy for practical use.

AB With increased use of precision agriculture techniques, information concerning within-field crop yield variability is becoming increasingly important for effective crop management. Despite the commercial availability of yield monitors, many crop harvesters are not equipped with them. Moreover, yield monitor data can only be collected at harvest and used for after-season management. On the other hand, remote sensing imagery obtained during the growing season can be used to generate yield maps for both within-season and after-season management. This paper gives an overview on the use of airborne multispectral and hyperspectral imagery and high-resolution satellite imagery for assessing crop growth and yield variability. The methodologies for image acquisition and processing and for the integration and analysis of image and yield data are discussed. Five application examples are provided to illustrate how airborne multispectral and hyperspectral imagery and high-resolution satellite imagery have been used for mapping crop yield variability. Image processing techniques including vegetation indices, unsupervised classification, correlation and regression analysis, principal component analysis, and supervised and unsupervised linear spectral unmixing are used in these examples. Some of the advantages and limitations on the use of different types of remote sensing imagery and analysis techniques for yield mapping are also discussed.

AB Accurate classification and mapping of crops is essential for supporting sustainable land management. Such maps can be created based on satellite remote sensing; however, the selection of input data and optimal classifier algorithm still needs to be addressed especially for areas where field data is scarce. We exploited the intra-annual variation of temporal signatures of remotely sensed observations and used prior knowledge of crop calendars for the development of a two-step processing chain for crop classification. First, Landsat-based time-series metrics capturing within-season phenological variation were preprocessed and analyzed using Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The developmental stage of each crop was modeled by fitting harmonic function. The model's output was further used for the automatic generation of training samples. Second, several classification methods (support vector machines, random forest, decision fusion) were tested. As input data for crop classification, composites based on Sentinel-1 and Landsat images were used. Overall classification accuracies exceeded 80% when the seasonal composites were used. Winter cereals were the most accurately classified, while we observed misclassifications among summer crops. The proposed approach offers a potential to accurately map crops in the areas where in situ field data are scarce or unavailable.

DE Crop Classification; Remote Sensing; Soft Computing; Fuzzy Logic
AB Image classification is one of the crucial techniques in detecting the crops from remotely sensed data as mapping of crops is a complex activity which in turn is an important parameter for planning and management of irrigation command area. Classifying remotely sensed data into a thematic map remains a challenge because many factors, such as the complexity of the landscape in a study area, selected remotely sensed data, and image-processing and classification approaches, may affect the success of a classification. Up-to-date and accurate classification results are required for analyses, which provide basis for deciding and implementing policies and plans for management of agricultural crops in local, regional and global scale. Successful identification of crops requires knowledge of the developmental stages and appearance of each crop in the area to be inventoried. The crops thus identified from the remote sensing data can be utilized to estimate crop water requirements for irrigation planning and management. Supervised and unsupervised classifications have been in common use in remote sensing for many years which are known as hard classification. Supervised and unsupervised classifications rely on classical set theory in assigning pixels into discrete classes based on training sets and some statistically determined criteria. Conventional classification methods such as Supervised and Unsupervised classification techniques are often incapable of performing satisfactorily in the presence of mixed pixels, the pixels which are not completely occupied by a single homogeneous category. Soft computing techniques are useful for tackling these real-world problems based on fuzzy systems, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms. These techniques are widely used nowadays by researchers. Nevertheless, each model has its own advantages and disadvantages.
   Contrary to hard classifiers, fuzzy classifier does not make a definitive decision about the land cover class to which each pixel belongs. Rather, they develop statements of the degree to which each pixel belongs to each of the land cover classes being considered. It is achieved by applying a function called "membership function" on remotely sensed images. Artificial Neural Networks are computer programs that are designed to simulate human-learning processes through establishment and reinforcement of linkages between input data and output data. Artificial neural network is used as a powerful tool for pattern classification and have been found to be accurate in the classification of remotely sensed data. The paper reviews application of different soft computing classification techniques for crop mapping which is necessary for estimating crop water requirements with the help of satellite images.

AB Using satellite remote sensing has become a mainstream approach for extracting crop spatial distribution. Making edges finer is a challenge, while simultaneously extracting crop spatial distribution information from high-resolution remote sensing images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on the characteristics of the crop area in the Gaofen 2 (GF-2) images, this paper proposes an improved CNN to extract fine crop areas. The CNN comprises a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor employs a spectral feature extraction unit to generate spectral features, and five coding-decoding-pair units to generate five level features. A linear model is used to fuse features of different levels, and the fusion results are up-sampled to obtain a feature map consistent with the structure of the input image. This feature map is used by the classifier to perform pixel-by-pixel classification. In this study, the SegNet and RefineNet models and 21 GF-2 images of Feicheng County, Shandong Province, China, were chosen for comparison experiment. Our approach had an accuracy of 93.26%, which is higher than those of the existing SegNet (78.12%) and RefineNet (86.54%) models. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in extracting crop spatial distribution information from GF-2 remote sensing images.

AB Remote sensing has been increasingly used in monitoring and analyzing agricultural activities. Crop identification based on analysis of individual pixel response, without considering neighboring pixels, may lead to poor results. In this paper, we investigate the use of superpixels generated by the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to delineate homogeneous regions in images to help crop identification. The proposed classification strategy consists of combining pixel-level classification probabilities, estimated using the pixel spectral response, with pooled probability values of the pixels located inside superpixels. Weighting both probability contributions produce a hybrid classification. We test this idea to map the interim-harvest of corn and cotton in an agricultural area in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, characterized by the presence of large farms. For this, we use a cloudfree multispectral image captured by the wide-field imaging camera onboard the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 4 (CBERS-4), that acquires four bands in the visible and near-infrared with a pixel spatial resolution of 64 m/pixel. The two main crops in our study area where identified with an overall accuracy of about 85%. Encouraging results suggest that the proposed method may be used as part of a remote sensing-based crop identification system.

AB Mapping and detecting stress at both local and regional scales are very important in site specific management. Launching the first generation of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing satellite at the beginning of the 21st century provided the opportunity to have better understanding of crop stress and the extent of stress in a specific environment. This work was carried out to assess the ability of hyperspectral and high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery to detect stress in wheat in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A field work visit was made during winter season of 2007, in March, (5-30: wheat) to collect ground reference data including soil samples, vegetation samples, water samples, chlorophyll estimates, reflectance measurements and GPS coordinates. The work visit was timed to coincide with the acquisition of QuickBird satellite imagery (April 7, 2007). The results further showed that the QuickBird image successfully detected stress within the field and local scales, and therefore can be a robust tool in identifying issues of crop management at a local scale. A strong linear relationship existed between RVI derived from in situ and RVI derived from satellite data (R = 0.75; p = 0.000). The results further showed that MLC was an effective classification algorithm for differentiating different crops within the study area.

AB Feature plays a vital role in classification task. In this context, feature selection and feature extraction is an essential module for the classification of any kind of data, namely textual database, image database consisting of simple images or complex images like remote sensing images collected through satellites. Use of particular features is domain and problem specific. For instance, very specific features different from others might be needed for classifying agricultural areas or crops within agricultural fields. Identification of such specific features pertaining to satellite images exhibiting its agriculture coverage is a challenging problem. Therefore features related to satellite images are studied and different methods or techniques used for optimal feature selection have also been studied and analyzed.

To this end, C-band AirSAR and European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) data collected on the Flevoland site, extracted from the European RAdar-Optical Research Assemblage (ERA-ORA) library, have been used. The results obtained in classifying seven types of crops are discussed on the basis of the computed confusion matrices. The effect of increasing the number of polarizations and/or measurements dates are discussed and a scheme of interyear dynamic classification of five crop types is considered.

ID SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; ACCURACY
AB Satellite remote sensing is an invaluable tool to assess the status and changes of irrigated agricultural systems. Agricultural sites are among the most heterogeneous sites at the landscape level: spatial pattern of agricultural fields, within-field heterogeneity, crop phenology and crop management practices vary significantly. Highly dynamic objects (crops and crop rotations) result in large temporal variability of surface spatial heterogeneity. Technological advances have opened the possibility to monitor agricultural sites combining satellite images with both high spatial resolution and high revisit frequency, which could overcome these constraints. Yet depending on the field sizes and crop phenology of the agricultural system observed, requisites in terms of the instrument's spatial resolution and optimal timing of crop observation will be different. The overall goal is to quantitatively define region specific satellite observation support requirements in order to perform land use classification at the field basis. The main aspect studied here is the influence of spatial resolution on the accuracy of land use classification over a variety of different irrigated agricultural landscapes. This will guide in identifying an appropriate spatial resolution and input parameters for classification. The study will be performed over distinct locations in irrigated agro-ecosystems in Central Asia, where reliable information on agricultural crops and crop rotations is needed for sustainable land and water management.

AB CropWatch is a monitoring system developed and operated by the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (Chinese Academy of Sciences) to provide global-scale crop information. Now in its 15th year of operation, CropWatch was modified several times to be a timely, comprehensive and independent global agricultural monitoring system using advanced remote sensing technology. Currently CropWatch is being upgraded with new indicators based on new sensors, especially those on board of China Environmental Satellite (HJ-1 CCD), the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) on Chinese meteorological satellite (FY-3A) and cloud classification products of FY-2. With new satellite data, CropWatch will generate new indicators such as fallow land ratio (FLR), crop condition for irrigated (CCI) and non-irrigated (CCNI) areas separately, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency for the photosynthetically active radiation (RUEPAR) and cropping index (CI) with crop rotation information (CRI). In this paper, the methods for monitoring the new indicators are applied to the North China Plain which is one of the major grain producing areas in China. This paper shows the preliminary results of the new indicators and methods; they still need to be thoroughly validated before being incorporated into the operational CropWatch system. In the future, the new and improved indicators will help us to better understand the global situation of food security.

AB The application of remote sensory images in crop monitoring has been increasing in the recent years due to its high classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel parallel classification methodology is proposed using a new clustering and classification concept. A novel neural network model with the Bs-Lion training algorithm is developed by integrating the Bayesian regularization training with the Lion Algorithm. Here, two levels of parallel processing are performed, namely parallel WLI-Fuzzy clustering and parallel BS-Lion neural network classification. The experimentation of the proposed parallel methodology is carried out using satellite images obtained from the Indian remote sensing satellite IRS-P6. The performance of the proposed system is compared with the existing techniques using validation measures accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The experimentations resulted in promising results with an accuracy of 0.8994, sensitivity of 0.8682 and specificity of 0.8739, which favour the performance of the proposed parallel architecture in the classification.

AB Measurement of crop residue cover over large areas is useful for monitoring conservation tillage adoption, assessing carbon sequestration potential and erosion modeling. This study was designed to test the accuracy of crop residue estimates in current Tillage Transect Surveys, and to test the feasibility of predicting crop residue cover based on data recorded by Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite scenes. A total of 468 corn and/or soybean fields in 11 Minnesota counties were characterized for residue cover in the course of three sampling campaigns coinciding in time with satellite scene acquisition. Results showed that Tillage Transect Survey estimates were correct for 49 percent to 74 percent of fields when either five or two categories were used in classification respectively. Regression analysis showed a strong positive relationship between percent soybean residue cover and ETM+ bands 1, 3, and 7 (r(2) = 0.66) and between percent corn residue and ETM+ bands 4, 5 and 7 (r(2) = 0.44). Three additional indices based on satellite digital numbers, the Soil Tillage Index, Normalized Difference Index, and Normalized Difference Tillage Index had coefficients of determination between 0.02 and 0.56 for corn and soybean residues. The Crop Residue Index Multiband model, a more physically based model, correctly predicted residue cover categories for 30 to 64 percent of fields when five or two categories were used in classification respectively. We conclude that remote-sensing techniques had accuracy as good or better than Tillage Transect Surveys estimates when residue cover classifications were decreased to two categories (0 to 30 percent, and >30 percent). Since residue cover information is primarily needed to assess the extent of two categories, conservation and conventional tillage, remote sensing with Landsat imagery provides a means of sampling every field with an efficient, economical and uniform methodology.

These characteristics are fundamental for monitoring strategic agricultural crops in Brazil, such as sugarcane. Data mining is a promising approach to enhance remote sensing data analysis. The objective of this work was to apply the decision tree induction technique to classify sugarcane crop in Sao Paulo, Brazil, by using MODIS data. A classification model with a good accuracy has been obtained. Furthermore, such an induction technique allowed for knowledge discovery through decision rules that are relevant for specialists. The results revealed the adherence of data mining techniques to satellite image classification problems.

Most existing crop-specific cover products based on remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms cannot serve large agriculture production areas as a result of poor model transfer capabilities. Developing a generalizable crop classification model for spatial transfer across regions is greatly needed. A deep learning approach, named DeepCropMapping (DCM), has been developed based on long short-term memory structure with attention mechanisms through integrating multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing data for large-scale dynamic corn and soybean mapping. Full cross validation of classification experiments were conducted in six sites each covering 2,890,000 pixels at 30 m resolution in the U.S. corn belt from Year 2015 to 2018. Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were adopted as the input satellite observations and ground reference, respectively. Transformer, Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were built for comparison. The DCM model produced a mean kappa score of 85.8% in base sites and a mean average kappa score of 82.0% in transfer sites at the end of the growing season. It yielded a comparable performance to Transformer and better than RF and MLP at the local test. The DCM model significantly outperformed other three models with a 95% confidence interval in the spatial transfer analysis. The results demonstrated the capability of learning generalizable features by the DCM model from ARD time series. The computational complexity analysis suggested that the DCM model required a shorter training time than Transformer but longer than MLP and RF. The results of the in-season classification experiment indicated the DCM model captured critical information from key growth phases and achieved higher accuracy than other models after the beginning of July. By monitoring the classification confidence in each time step, the results showed that the increased length of seasonal remote sensing time series would reduce the classification uncertainty in all sites. This study provided a viable option toward large-scale dynamic crop mapping through the integration of deep learning and remote sensing time series.

AB Crop mapping is essential for agricultural management, economic development planning, and ecological conservation. Remote sensing with a large field of view provides us with a potential technique for large-scale crop mapping. However, most of the previous studies have focused on multi-temporal crop mapping, requiring multiple imaging over a period of time, which is impossible in the cloudy season due to the absence of clear atmospheric windows. Recently, with the progress of spaceborne hyperspectral imaging technology, wide-width hyperspectral satellite images, which provide abundant spectral and spatial structure information, have made the precision crop mapping of large areas possible. This paper focuses on deep learning based crop mapping using one-shot hyperspectral satellite imagery, where three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, i.e., 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 3D-CNN models, are applied for end-to-end crop mapping. In addition, a manifold learning based visualization approach, i.e., t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), is introduced to illustrate the discriminative ability of the deep semantic features extracted by the different CNN models. To demonstrate the advantages of one-shot hyperspectral satellite images, an experiment was designed to compare the crop mapping performance of different remote sensing data sources, where both mono-temporal and multi-temporal multispectral images (MSIs) of the same research area were introduced for a systematic comparison. The classification accuracy when using hyperspectral satellite images was found to reach more than 94%, which was much better than that when using mono-temporal MSIs, and was comparable to the result when using multi-temporal MSIs. These findings will be important for the application of hyperspectral data when mapping large-area crop landscapes, and they confirm the potential of CNN models, particularly 3D-CNN models, for crop recognition.

AB Accurate information about land use patterns is crucial for a sustainable and economical use of water in agricultural systems. Water demand estimation, yield modeling and agrarian policy are only a few applications addressed by land use classifications based on remote sensing imagery. In Central Asia, where fields are traditionally large and state order crops dominate the area, small units of fields are often separated for the additional cultivation of income crops for the farmers. Traditional object based land use classifications on multi-temporal satellite imagery using field boundaries show low classification accuracies on these separated fields, expressed by a high uncertainty of the final class labels. Although segmentation of smaller subfields was shown to be suitable for improving the classification result, the extraction of subfields is still a time-consuming and error-prone process.
   In this study, energy based Graph-Cut segmentation technique is used to enhance the segmentation process and finally to improve the classification result. The interactive segmentation technique was successfully adopted from bio-medical image analysis to fit remote sensing imagery in the spatial and in the temporal domain. A set of rules was developed to perform the image segmentation procedure on pixels of single satellite datasets and on objects representing time series of a vegetation index. An ensemble classifier based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machines was used to receive information about classification uncertainty before and after applying the segmentation.
   It is demonstrated that subfield extraction based on Graph Cuts outperforms traditional image segmentation approaches in simplicity and reduces the risk of under-and over-segmentation significantly. Classification uncertainty decreased using the derived subfields as object boundaries instead of original field boundaries. The segmentation technique performs well on several multi-temporal satellite images without changing parameters and may be used to refine object based land use classifications to subfield level.

AB Satellite crop detection technologies are focused on the detection of different types of crops in fields. The information of crop-type area is more useful for food security than the earlier phenology stage is. Currently, data obtained from remote sensing (RS) are used to solve tasks related to the identification of the type of agricultural crops; additionally, modern technologies using AI methods are desired in the postprocessing stage. In this paper, we develop a methodology for the supervised classification of time series of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, compare the accuracies based on different input datasets and find how the accuracy of classification develops during the season. In the EU, a unified Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is available to provide essential field borders. To increase usability, we also provide a classification of the entire field. This field classification also improves overall accuracy.

AB Monitoring changes in paddy areas is important for economic and environmental research, since rice is a staple food in Asia and paddy agriculture is a major cropping system. Recently, remote sensing has been used to observe changes in the areas of paddy. However, monitoring paddy areas by remote sensing is difficult owing to the temporal changes in paddy, and the differences in the spatiotemporal characteristics of paddy agriculture between countries or regions. In our previous research using a multilayered perceptron and spatiotemporal satellite sensor data, the proposed classifier yielded a correct classification rate of 90.8%. In this article, we proposed a cooperative learning method using particle swarm optimization as the global search method and a multilayered perceptron as the local search method in order to improve the classification accuracy for practical use.

AB Agriculture is backbone of Indian economy, where agricultural production is estimated based upon its sown area. The probable reasons for not having accurate and transparent statistics on Indian agronomy would be the existing inadequate facilities, unstable mechanism, and sluggish government functionaries. With the advent of remote sensing technologies, researchers are optimistic towards addressing such problems. It would be great challenge to classify multi-spectral satellite images due to its complexity, processing skills, and classification. The reviews on problems and prospects of supervised and unsupervised classification techniques, is highlighted in this paper. Literatures stated that one of such statistical learning model is support vector machine algorithm, which reveals to be the best suitable algorithm for vegetation discrimination using remote sensing images. In this paper, an attempt is made in order to enhance the performance of SVM by optimizing its training part. The approach aims at investigating improvement corners on SVM classification for estimating agricultural area using remote sensing data and explores futuristic research in this domain too. Several attempts have been made using supervised SVM model, but use of EA for enhancement of SVM is the novelty that distinguishes this research weigh against the traditional approaches. Findings of such intermingling is put forth through this approach in constructive way so as to address crop identification for reducing the manual efforts taken to measure the agricultural area covered by the specific crops.

AB For semi-arid ecosystems, the remote sensing based crop type classification is often hampered by heterogeneous agricultural landscapes with mixed crops and small scale land use. Under these complicated conditions, the use of high spatio-temporal satellite time series data can improve classification results. in this context, Sentinel-2 for Agriculture (Sen2Agri) provides an open source processing system to exploit Sentinel-2 imagery in an operational way for crop monitoring. This research was conducted to explore and evaluate the potentiality of Sen2Agri system for crop type mapping in a highly fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscape in Haouz plain, Morocco. Based on the phenological information from field campaign, Sentinel-2 time series data for 2018 agricultural season, were processed to classify the main crop types dominated in the study area. After classification, accuracy assessment was undertaken based on generated crop map and resulted in Overall Accuracy (OA) of 85.6 and Kappa coefficients of 0.81.

AB Imaging systems, particularly those on board satellites, provide a repetitive and consistent view of the earth that has been used in many remote sensing applications such as urban growth, deforestation and crop monitoring, weather prediction, land use mapping, land cover mapping and so on. For each application it is necessary to develop a specific methodology to extract information from the image data. To develop a methodology it is necessary to identify a procedure based on image processing techniques that is more adequate to the problem solution. In spite of the application complexity, some basic techniques are common in most of the remote sensing applications named as image registration, image fusion, image segmentation and classification. Hence, this paper aims to present an overview about the use of image processing techniques to solve a general problem on remote sensing application. A case study on an urban application is provided to illustrate the use of remote sensing technologies for solving the problem.

SAR is sensitive to the geometrical structures and dielectric properties of the targets and has a certain penetration ability to some agricultural targets. The capabilities of SAR for agriculture applications can be organized into three main categories: crop identification and crop planting area statistics, crop and cropland parameter extraction, and crop yield estimation. According to the above concepts, this paper systematically analyses the recent progresses, existing problems and future directions in SAR agricultural remote sensing. In recent years, with the remarkable progresses in SAR remote sensing systems, the available SAR data sources have been greatly enriched. The accuracies of the crop classification and parameter extraction by SAR data have been improved progressively. But the development of modern agriculture has put forwarded higher requirements for SAR remote sensing. For instance, the spatial resolution and revisiting cycle of the SAR sensors, the accuracy of crop classification, the whole phenological period monitoring of crop growth status, the soil moisture inversion under the condition of high vegetation coverage, the integrations of SAR remote sensing retrieval information with hydrological models and/or crop growth models, and so on, still need to be improved. In the future, the joint use of optical and SAR remote sensing data, the application of multi-band multi-dimensional SAR, the precise and high efficient modeling of electromagnetic scattering and parameter extraction of crop and farmland composite scene, the development of light and small SAR systems like those onboard unmanned aerial vehicles and their applications will be active research areas in agriculture remote sensing. This paper concludes that SAR remote sensing has great potential and will play a more significant role in the various fields of agricultural remote sensing.

AB The knowledge of a crop spatial distribution in a region where it has a significant economic impact can play a relevant role. This knowledge can help both in monitoring the size and the evolution of invested land and in locating the intervention areas for specific politics.
   To avoid limitations of traditional information sources (as census data and land use/cover maps) an experimental analysis has been performed to evaluate the possibility of using satellite remote sensing images to locate hazelnut cultivation. To accomplish this objective multi-temporal and multi-spectral images of Viterbo (Italy) hazelnut production area have been used. Image processing and classification has been performed with a computer system. A GIS (Geographical Information System) has been used for maps management and integration.
   Quantitative controls on results of images classification show a satisfactory quality level, but some limitations too. These can be reduced through a wider knowledge panel derived from a widespread diffusion of this crop identification technology.
   As a conclusion it can be stated that satellite remote sensing data are a useful tool to monitor hazelnut cultivation spatial distribution and that in the next future this technology is going to become one of the most important information sources for sector operators and public administrators.

AB Mapping vegetation fraction in crop fields is an important step in remote sensing applications for precision agriculture. Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolution and an unfavorable revisit time. Remote sensing sensors placed on low-altitude aerial platforms could fill this gap. This paper validated the availability of red green blue(RGB) and near infrared(NIR) imaging acquired from a delta-wing airplane platform with dual-camera for monitoring vegetation fraction, and explored the technological processes and methods for fast processing of remote sensing image. RGB imaging was used to calculate VIRGB and interpreted by different classification algorithms. We examined the classification accuracy of RGB images respectively in cotton yield estimation and rapid crops classification, further, to study the influence of flight altitude on the classification accuracy. Additionally, we assessed the applicability of NIR imaging in dynamic monitoring vegetation growth status. We found COM and ML achieved the best accuracy in cotton yield estimating, with overall accuracy of 95.42% and 96.25% at a 200m flight altitude. Besides, the result of analyzing the influence of flight altitudes (500m and 1000m) to crop quick classification indicated that VEG, COM and ML methods' variations associated with the flight altitudes, and classification accuracy at 1000m demonstrated more higher than 500m, which appeared better for mapping vegetation in a large area. In addition, we could found that NIR imaging had great potential in dynamic monitoring growth status of vegetation in the future. This paper provides evidence that RGB and NIR imaging acquired using a low-cost dual-camera onboard a delta-wing airplane at low altitudes were a suitable tool to use to discriminate vegetation. This opened the doors for the utilization of this platform and technology in precision agriculture applications and dynamic monitoring grassland biological disasters.

AB Remote sensing data is available free of cost with an ever-increase in the number of satellites. This satellite imagery can be used as raw input from which cultivated/non-cultivated and crop fields can be mapped. Previous trends included the use of traditional ML techniques and standard CNN, RNN for such mappings. In this paper, we investigate the segmentation models for the task of Landcover and Crop type Classification. We investigate the UNet, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+ in the data-rich states of Nebraska, Mid-West, United States. We acquire dataset from Cropland data Layer provided by USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Our Experimental results show that cultivated and non-cultivated landcover is classified with an accuracy of 90% and crop types are classified around 70% ensuring the models trained on one geographical area can be used for accurate classification in other geographical areas, which makes it more reliable for real-time application in agricultural business.

DT Article
AB The accuracy of cotton crop classification using satellite data has been assessed with respect to a detailed land cover map prepared by field survey. The effect of spatial resolution on classification accuracy was studied using LISS-I (spatial resolution 72.6 m) and LISS-II data (spatial resolution 36.25 m) of the Indian remote sensing satellite IRS-1B. The performances of the maximum likelihood and the minimum distance to mean as classifiers have also been assessed. LISS-II data have been found to give a higher classification accuracy. The estimate of cotton acreage using LISS-II data was closer to that obtained from the base map. The maximum likelihood classifier (MXL) and the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier performed equally well.

AB Crop classification is an important part of national agricultural management, and accurate crop classification is conducive to crop growth monitoring and yield assessment. However, due to the different growing years and regions, even the same crop has different growth processes and different phenological characteristics. Therefore, improving the spatial and temporal adaptability of the classification model is an important research content for large-scale crop classification. In this paper, several adjacent agricultural production areas are studied. Based on the stable time-series remote sensing image dataset, the adaptive changes of several machine learning classification methods with higher classification accuracy in spatial and temporal are studied. The paper selected Sentinel 1 satellite data with good anti-cloud interference and a short return visit cycle for experiments. Firstly, the training of each classification model in the same area is completed, and then the spatial adaptability of the model is studied in different adjacent ranges. Finally, the adaptability of different classification models to the change of the growth cycle of the same type of crop is also compared. The paper finds that the models such as CNN-LSTM and BinConvLSTM perform better in temporal and spatial.

AB Crop rotation is the sequential growth of crops in a year. The feasibility of deriving this information from multi-temporal satellite digital data acquired during different crop seasons in a year is reported herein. Red and NIR bands of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) LISS-I multidate data acquired in different crop seasons resulted in more than 95 percent accuracy of training site pixels. Similar result was also obtained using principal components of multidate data. Inclusion of data acquired during the transitional phase of crop seasons was found to improve classification accuracy. Four-date data acquired between October and March were found to be optimum for deriving such information for West Bengal. The results showed that a rice based single cropping system is the dominant rotation class of the district, while in the irrigation command area of Damodar river, a double cropping system of rice followed by rice and rice followed by potato were the major rotation classes.

AB FAO's most recent assessments indicate that, globally, in 2011-13, about one in eight people in the world are likely to have suffered from chronic hunger, not having adequate food supplies for an active and healthy life. Food security crises are now caused, almost exclusively, by problems in access to food, not absolute food availability, but, monitoring agricultural production remains fundamental. Traditional ground-based systems of production estimation have many limitations which have restricted their use. However, remotely sensed satellite data offer timely, objective, economical, and synoptic information for crop monitoring. The objective of this paper is to review the contribution of remote sensing techniques in the classification, monitoring of crop phenology and condition and estimation of production.

AB Land-cover data are used for the enforcement of quota restrictions, yield estimations and agricultural statistics. With the launch of the European Remote sensing Satellite (ERS-1) the first long-term spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become available for the mapping of land-cover. This paper assesses the capability of ERS-1 SAR precision data to (i) discriminate between the crop types for land-cover inventory purposes at (ii) the earliest stage in the growing season, using field-based classification. The objectives were tested for an agricultural region in The Netherlands where 12 crop types are found. Fourteen ERS-1 SAR images were available for this area, covering the 1992 growing season between May and November. The field-based classification yielded an overall classification accuracy of 80 per cent with the optimal data set. The stage at which the crop types could be assessed is crop dependent. Most crop types could not be distinguished before the month of August.

AB In order to exploit operationally remote sensing data for agricultural applications efficient and automated methods are required towards the accurate detection of vegetation, crops and different crop varieties. To this end, an object-based classification framework has been developed and validated towards the detection of vineyards and the discrimination of vine varieties. Very high resolution satellite data were collected over four wine-growing regions in Greece during a three-year period, i.e., 2012 to 2014. A rule-based classification scheme based on fuzzy logic was employed in order to firstly detect the vine parcels in the pan-sharpened multispectral satellite images. Then the canopy of each parcel was detected and separated from the soil in-between the vine rows. The detection of the different vine varieties followed based on a supervised classification procedure and spectral features. The overall validation and quite promising experimental results indicated that a throughout sensitivity analysis can form efficient operational tools for variety-based data analysis in precision viticulture.

These crop systems exhibit tremendous variability in crop yields and quality as imposed by variations in soil properties (water availability and nutrient deficiency) that lead to crop stress (disease development and weed competition). Some of the variability present in the growing environment results in persistent yield losses as well as crop-quality reductions. We are using state-of-the-art methodologies (GIS, GPS, remote sensing) to identify and map spatial variations of the crop. Through irnage-processing methods (NDVI and unsupervised classification), approximately 65% of the variation in yield was described using 4-m multispectral satellite data as a base image.

AB Using three-phase remote sensing images of China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 02B (CBERS02B) and Landsat-5 TM, tobacco field was extracted by the analysis of time series image based on the different phenological characteristics between tobacco and other crops. The spectral characteristics of tobacco and corn in luxuriant growth stage are very similar, which makes them difficult to be distinguished using a single-phase remote sensing image. Field film after tobacco seedlings transplanting can be used as significant sign to identify tobacco. Remote sensing interpretation map based on the fusion image of TM and CBERS02B's High-Resolution (HR) camera image was used as standard reference material to evaluate the classification accuracy of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) for time series image based on full samples test method. SAM has higher classification accuracy and stability than MLC in dealing with time series image. The accuracy and Kappa of tobacco coverage extracted by SAM are 83.4% and 0.692 respectively, which can achieve the accuracy required by tobacco coverage measurement in a large area.

AB The analysis, measurement, and computation of remote sensing images often require an enhanced supervised classification technique to develop an efficient spatial decision support system. Rice is a crop of global importance, which has drawn a great interest in using remote sensing techniques for evaluating its production. Ancillary information is widely used to improve the classification accuracy of satellite images. However, few of these studies questioned the importance and strategies of using this ancillary information. The enhanced decision support system in our study has two stages. In the first stage, the images are obtained from the remote sensing technique and the ancillary information is employed to increase the accuracy of classification. In the second stage, it is decided to construct an efficiently supervised classifier, which is used to evaluate the ancillary information. Back-propagation neural network (BPN) with extended delta bar delta (EDBD) algorithm is incorporated into our decision support classifier system. This classifier renders two crucial contributions: (1) the EDBD algorithm accelerates the convergence speed of the learning process and (2) the relative importance (RI) on each band of ancillary information is evaluated rationally.

AB The sugarcane production in the South-central region of Brazil has more than doubled over the last decade reaching a maximum of 557 million tons in 2010/11. A significant and unexpected decrease was observed in crop year 2011/12 dropping the production to 494 million tons. Several factors contributed to a major crop yield loss including a sudden frost event in Sao Paulo state. It is difficult to estimate the frost impact but remote sensing images might be useful to quantify the intensity of the damage and its spatial distribution. The objective of this study is to detect and evaluate the extent of the frost damage using MODIS, Landsat, and STRM data. Field work for classification and validation purposes was conducted shortly after frost occurrence. Preliminary analyses indicated that remote sensing satellite images were useful to detect and evaluate the extent the frost damage on sugarcane fields.

AB In India, in terms of area under cultivation, citrus is the third most cultivated fruit crop after Banana and Mango. Among citrus group, lime is one of the most important horticultural crops in India as the demand for its consumption is very high. Hence, preparing citrus crop inventories using remote sensing techniques would help in maintaining a record of its area and production statistics. This study shows how accurately citrus orchard can be classified using both IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS-III and LISS-IV data and depicts the optimum bio-widow for procuring satellite data to achieve high classification accuracy required for maintaining inventory of crop. Findings of the study show classification accuracy increased from 55% (using LISS-III) to 77% (using LISS-IV). Also, according to classified outputs and NDVI values obtained, April and May months were identified as optimum bio-window for citrus crop identification.

AB The classification of crops based on remote sensing technology is a necessary measure for large-scale agricultural monitoring. In the regions with good light conditions, optical satellite data can be used for crop classification with a satisfied result. However, there are also large regions of cloudy and rainy regions on the surface of the earth. In these regions, optical images can only obtained fragmented data through the cloud gap or even impossible to get, which cannot meet the requirements of rapid and accurate agricultural monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be rarely affected by atmospheric disturbances and sensitive to surface structure characteristics, so the SAR data has good application potential in agriculture. Especially in cloudy and rainy regions, its application for crop classification has more realistic significance. In this study, we classify crops based on Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data in Xifeng County at the geo-parcel scale with a recurrent neural network, the overall accuracy could up to 69 percent. This method can solve the problem of continuous optical data loss in crop classification in cloudy and rainy regions.

AB Crop detection from remote sensed images is of major interest for land use and land cover mapping. Classification techniques often require multi-temporal images. However, most of these techniques assume that the cultural cycle occurs at the same dates across plots or for a given crop and do not take into account the sensitivity to initial conditions of the dynamical behaviors. Such hypotheses are not well adapted when a wide diversity of practices is observed for the same crops from one crop field to another, which is often the case in tropical context. To cope with these difficulties, a new classification technique based on the global modeling technique is introduced in this paper. It is first applied to a case study based on chaotic oscillators. It is then tested on crop classification observed from satellite data.
   The Berambadi watershed (South India) is taken as a case study to test this new classification approach. Crop classification is a difficult problem in Southern India where optical satellite images are scarce during the monsoon season due to cloud cover, and where crop land is divided in parcels (i.e. crop fields) of very small sizes with diversified crops. The Landsat-8 images were used to monitor an ensemble of 104 parcels of ten different crops (irrigated and non-irrigated). Using global modeling, a bank of crop models was first obtained for the ten crops considered in the study. A metric is introduced to compare the observed signal to the obtained crop-models used as reference for each crop dynamic. Based on this metric, the possibility to use global models as references for distinguishing crops is investigated. The results provide a good proof-of-concept and show promising potential for crop classification. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing offers an efficient and reliable means of collecting the information required for mapping, assessing and monitoring of agricultural crop conditions and production. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have led to the development of hyperspectral remote sensing imaging devices which can obtain high-resolution radiance data. This study evaluates the potential of the hyperspectral data in discrimination and mapping of agricultural crops using EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral image over the Thalasseri Taluk, Kerala, India. Five agricultural crops such as arecanut, banana, cashew, coconut and rubber were considered for the study. The EO-1 was pre-processed using minimum noise fraction (MNF) transform to reduce the atmospheric effects on the imagery. Support vector machine classification and minimum distance classification were applied in order to perform image data classification based on different crops. The optimum wavelengths suitable for crop discrimination were derived by analysing the spectral reflectance curve as well as by using the techniques such as stepwise discriminant analysis and partial least square regression (PLSR). This study establishes that the Hyperion bands 53, 56, 62, 74, 79 and 84 are suitable for crop-type discrimination. The support vector machine classification is suitable for mapping the crops from Hyperion imagery with a higher accuracy of about 80% and above.

The main idea of this paper was comparison of pixel-based approaches to crop mapping in Ukraine and exploring efficiency of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform for solving "Big Data" problem and providing high resolution crop classification map for large territory. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that Google Earth Engine (GEE) provided very good performance in enabling access to remote sensing products through the cloud platform, but our own approach based on ensemble of neural networks outperformed SVM, decision tree and random forest classifiers that are available in GEE.

AB Site-specific crop management (SSCM) is one facet of precision agriculture which is helping increase production with minimal input. It has enhanced the cost-benefit scenario in crop production. Even though the SSCM is very widely used in row crop agriculture like corn, wheat, rice, soybean, etc. it has very little application in cash crops like fruit and nut. The main goal of this review paper was to conduct a comprehensive review of advanced technologies, including geospatial technologies, used in site-specific management of fruit and nut crops. The review explores various remote sensing data from different platforms like satellite, LIDAR, aerial, and field imaging. The study analyzes the use of satellite sensors, such as Quickbird, Landsat, SPOT, and IRS imagery as well as hyperspectral narrow-band remote sensing data in study of fruit and nut crops in blueberry, citrus, peach, apple, etc. The study also explores other geospatial technologies such as GPS, GIS spatial modeling, advanced image processing techniques, and information technology for suitability study, orchard delineation, and classification accuracy assessment. The study also provides an example of a geospatial model developed in ArcGIS ModelBuilder to automate the blueberry production suitability analysis. The GIS spatial model is developed using various crop characteristics such as chilling hours, soil permeability, drainage, and pH, and land cover to determine the best sites for growing blueberry in Georgia, U.S. The study also provides a list of spectral reflectance curves developed for some fruit and nut crops, blueberry, crowberry, redblush citrus, orange, prickly pear, and peach. The study also explains these curves in detail to help researchers choose the image platform, sensor, and spectrum wavelength for various fruit and nut crops SSCM.

AB Techniques that provide a rapid and widespread assessment of crop properties equip industry decision makers with knowledge to improve their farming environment, both tactically and strategically. An interdisciplinary approach that links the fields of hyperspectral remote sensing, statistical data mining and sugarcane systems was undertaken to establish new relationships to determine variety type and crop age of sugarcane plants. In contrast to commonly used sensors such as those occupied by Landsat satellites, images captured by hyperspectral sensors can provide a more detailed assessment of crop status. Appropriate statistical analysis methods are needed to decode the multifaceted information recorded in these hyperspectral images. A range of statistical approaches have been applied for analysis of an EO-1 hyperion hyperspectral image from a major sugarcane growing region in Australia. Two relatively new classification methods - support vector machines and random forests - demonstrated superior performance in classifying sugarcane variety and crop cycle, e. g. the number of times that the plant has grown back after harvest, when compared against traditional statistical methods. Assignment results were further enhanced when classifications of pixels within sugarcane paddocks were aggregated to paddock classifications using paddock boundary information. Whilst the analysis methods of the hyperspectral data have been tested for the classification of variety and crop cycle, the potential application arenas for this type of imagery is both extensive and relatively unexplored. This type of data coupled with appropriate analysis methods will play a vital role in futuristic sustainable agriculture practices as this imagery becomes more accessible and as land managers and researchers become more aware of the types of decisions that hyperspectral remote sensing data can aid.

AB Various indices are used for assessing vegetation and soil properties in satellite remote sensing applications. Some indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), are capable of simply differentiating crop vitality and water stress. Nowadays, remote sensing capabilities with high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution are available to analyse classification problems in precision agriculture. Many challenges in precision agriculture can be addressed by supervised classification, such as crop type classification, disease and stress (e.g., grass, water and nitrogen) monitoring. Instead of performing classification based on designated indices, this paper explores direct classification using different bands information as features. Land cover classification by using the recently launched Sentinel-2A image is adopted as a case study to validate our method. Four approaches of featured band selection are compared to classify five classes (crop, tree, soil, water and road) with the support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm, where the first approach utilizes traditional empirical indices as features and the latter three approaches adopt specific bands (red, near infrared and short wave infrared) related to indices, specific bands after ranking by mutual information (MI), and full bands of on board sensors as features, respectively. It is shown that a better classification performance can be achieved by directly using the selected bands after MI ranking compared with the one using empirical indices and specific bands related to indices, while the use of all 13 bands can marginally improve the classification accuracy than MI based one. Therefore, it is recommended that this approach can be applied for specific Sentinel-2A image classification problems in precision agriculture.

AB Effective and timely monitoring of croplands is critical for managing food supply. While remote sensing data from earth-observing satellites can be used to monitor croplands over large regions, this task is challenging for small-scale croplands as they cannot be captured precisely using coarse-resolution data. On the other hand, the remote sensing data in higher resolution are collected less frequently and contain missing or disturbed data. Hence, traditional sequential models cannot be directly applied on high-resolution data to extract temporal patterns, which are essential to identify crops. In this work, we propose a generative model to combine multi-scale remote sensing data to detect croplands at high resolution. During the learning process, we leverage the temporal patterns learned from coarse-resolution data to generate missing high-resolution data. Additionally, the proposed model can track classification confidence in real time and potentially lead to an early detection. The evaluation in an intensively cultivated region demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in cropland detection.

AB This study presents a crop planting and type proportion (CPTP) method for crop acreage estimation of complex and diverse agricultural landscapes. CPTP has three major components: (1) Crop planting proportion (CPP), estimated with wide-swath satellite remote sensing data to completely cover the monitoring area by segmenting cropped and non-cropped areas through unsupervised classification. (2) Crop type proportion (CTP), estimated by transect sampling and a special GPS-Video-GIS instrument (GVG) and a visual interpretation of crop type proportion in collected pictures for different strata. (3) Multiplication of CPP and CTP with arable land area at the strata level, summed to the province and national level. Validation has been done with in situ data for different agricultural landscapes over China. Both CPP estimation with remote sensing data and CTP estimation through ground survey have a high accuracy with average relative error (RE) and root mean square error (RMSE) equal to 1.42% and 1.67% for CPP and to 2.63% and 2.25% for CTP. The RE for crop acreage estimation equals to 4.09%. The CPTP method thus has a high accuracy, yields timely information at low costs, and is robust and provides objective results. The study concludes that the CPTP method can be used for large area crop acreage estimation of complex agriculture landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automated crop classification and mapping is currently a topic of significant research interest worldwide due to the following two factors. First, it is one of the key tasks on which the success of digital agriculture hinges, and second, there is wider availability of remote-sensed imagery, both optical and radar-based, that can help with remote monitoring of crops. Several different models have been developed for the purpose, but a hitherto unexplored geography or time period generally requires fresh ground data specific to the space and time, and, in many cases, fresh feature engineering as well, due to lack of intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. A near-universal model that can be applied with minimal fine-tuning using free and open access satellite imagery and requiring no new ground data, which can reduce data costs, is elusive. This paper underscores the challenges involved via a case study with two different classification approaches at various regions. Methods and techniques that can ameliorate the problems are discussed.

ID SATELLITE
AB Although it is well known that one of the main advantages of remote sensing from satellites is the synoptic and repeated collection of data, few examples of its application to map multi-year cropping patterns and/or crop rotations have been developed. Those examples reveal different conceptions of the term cropping pattern and also show the difficulty or limitations of these methods in mapping cropping patterns or crop rotations in more than two successive years. The present paper proposes a method that allows long term cropping patterns to be mapped using time-series of crop maps derived from supervised classification of remote sensing data. These maps allow implicit spatial and temporal relationships between the crops grown in an agricultural area. The cropping pattern is understood to be the spatial distribution of associations between crops or crops and uncultivated land in the same fields (although not in a particular order or sequence) during the period of the analysed time-series. The method was applied to map the multi-year cropping patterns in the Flumen irrigation district (33,000 ha), which is located in the Ebro Valley (northeast Spain). A 7-year time-series (1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000) of crop maps derived from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ images was used to obtain the yearly crop maps from which to derive the multi-year cropping patterns. To achieve this, the proposed method looks for the spatial and temporal relationships between the main crops present in the study area in their typical locations (areas where the crops are most frequently located) and the alternate crops that have been in these locations in any of the years of the analysed time-series. GIS overlay analysis operations-mainly cross-classification operations-are applied to derive the spatial and temporal relationships between crops. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indonesia recently implemented a novel, technology-driven approach for conducting agricultural production surveys, which involves monthly observations at many thousands of strategic locations and automated data logging via a cellular phone application. Data from these comprehensive field surveys offer immense value for advancing remote sensing technology to map crop production across Indonesia, particularly through the development of machine learning approaches to relate survey data with satellite imagery. The objective of this study was to compare different machine learning scenarios for classifying and mapping the temporal progression of paddy rice production stages across West Java, Indonesia using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Monthly paddy rice survey data at 21,696 locations across West Java from November 2018 through April 2019 were used for model training and testing. Five classes related to rice production stage or other field conditions were defined, including rice at tillering, heading, and harvest stages, rice fields with little to no vegetation present, and non-rice areas. A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) nodes provided optimal performance with classification accuracies of 79.6% and 75.9% for model training and testing, respectively, and reduced computational effort. Other approaches that incorporated a convolutional neural network (CNN) either reduced classification accuracy or increased computational effort. Deep machine learning methods (RNN and CNN) generally outperformed other non-deep classifiers, which achieved up to 63.3% accuracy for model testing. Classification accuracies were optimized by inputting two Sentinel-1 channels (VH and VV polarizations) and ten Sentinel-2 channels. Temporal patterns of paddy rice production stages were consistent between the monthly ground-based agricultural survey data and 10-m, satellite-based rice classification maps obtained by applying the LSTM-based RNN across West Java. The results demonstrated the value of combining modern agricultural survey data, satellite remote sensing, and a recurrent neural network to develop multitemporal maps of paddy rice production stages.

AB BACKGROUND Detection and diagnosis of emerging arthropod outbreaks in horticultural glasshouse crops, such as bok choy and spinach, is both important and challenging. A major challenge is to accurately detect and diagnose arthropod outbreaks in growing crops (changes in canopy size, structure, and composition), and when crops are grown under three fertilization regimes. Day-time remote sensing inside glasshouses is highly sensitive to inconsistent lighting, spectral scattering, and shadows casted by glasshouse structures. To avoid these issues, a unique feature of this study was that hyperspectral remote sensing data were acquired after sunset with an active light source. As part of this study, we describe a comprehensive approach to performance assessment of classification algorithms based on hyperspectral remote sensing data.
   RESULTS Based on average hyperspectral remote sensing profiles from individual crop plants, none of the 31 individual spectral bands showed consistent significant response to leafminer infestation and non-significant response to fertilizer regime. Multi-band classification algorithms were subjected to a comprehensive performance assessment to quantify risks of model over-fitting and low repeatability of classification algorithms. The performance assessment of classification algorithms addresses the important 'bias-variance trade-off'. Truly independent validation (training and validation data sets being separated over time) revealed that leafminer infestation could be detected with >99% accuracy in both bok choy and spinach.
   CONCLUSION We conclude that detailed hyperspectral profiles (not single spectral bands) can accurately detect and diagnose leafminer infestation over time and across fertilizer regimes. Hyperspectral remote sensing data acquisition at night with an active light source has the potential to enable arthropod infestations in glasshouse-grown crops, such as, bok choy and spinach. In addition, we conclude that effective use and deployment of hyperspectral remote sensing requires thorough performance assessments of classification algorithms, and we propose an analytical performance method to address this important matter.

AB Satellite image time series classification has become a research focus with the launch of new remote sensing sensors capable of capturing images with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. In particular, in the field of crop classification, time dimension information is particularly important. Although some advanced machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs), can achieve good results, they often ignore the time series information. To make full use of temporal and spectral information in multitemporal remote sensing images, a channel attention-based temporal convolutional network (CA-TCN) is proposed in this letter. Specifically, the proposed method is composed of two main modules: temporal convolutional network and attention block. The temporal convolutional network can capture long-range dependence by using a hierarchy of temporal convolutional filters. To capture relevant information inside the sequence and enhance the important information, the attention block is used to enhance the important features in the channel dimension since not all bands contain equal information in crop type classification. The proposed CA-TCN can excavate deeper phenological characteristics. Compared to the temporal attention-based temporal convolutional network and other deep learning-based models, the proposed CA-TCN has achieved state-of-the-art performance in the Breizhcrops dataset with fewer parameters.

AB In this paper we describe the experimental set-up of an alternative sampling technique for deriving crop area statistics from hybrid remote sensing data. The main aim of this work is to assess whether more accurate estimates can be derived at a regional scale through the systematic integration of image information layers from diverse sensors, mainly optical and SAR systems. The proposed methodology is based on the analysis of the statistical problems related to crop area estimation from remote sensing imagery. These include the representation of agricultural areas, stratified sampling with remote sensing instruments with different radiometric and spatial resolutions (and associated classification errors). The work is part of an ongoing study to establish robust classification methods and error budgets models for remote sensing techniques used in agricultural land use monitoring and assessment projects.

AB Nowadays, with the development of remote sensing technologies and image processing methods, satellite images have become frequently preferred in studies to determine the crop pattern in agricultural areas. In this study, it is aimed to detection the crop pattern in agricultural areas with high accuracy by using object-based classification technique from high spatial resolution IKONOS satellite images. The study area is located on the South-west of the Karacabey district of the Bursa province in the Marmara Region and covers an area of nearly 9x9 km(2). Tomato, corn, pepper, wheat, rice and sugar beet are the main products grown in the region. In this study, the IKONOS satellite image is segmented using multi-resolution segmentation technique. The most appropriate value for the scale parameter, which is the most important parameter in the segmentation process, has been determined by ESP-2 (Estimation of Scale Parameter) software. Various combinations have been tried for shape and compactness parameters in order to find the optimal segmentation parameters. In order to increase classification accuracy, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GLCM texture measurement methods have been used, including homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, mean, variance, and entropy. Using the data set from consist 29 bands, the image classification process have been performed using the object-based nearest neighbor classification technique in the eCognition software. The obtained classification results have been tested on parcel basis using 2212 ground truth data. The overall accuracy of the classification has been calculated as 87.5%. The results show that the high spatial resolution IKONOS satellite image can be used to detection high accuracy with object-based classification of agricultural crop pattern.

AB Image classifications including sub pixel analysis are often used to estimate directly the crop acreage, while ground data collected during field surveys play a secondary role. This type of crop area assessment using image classifications often leads to a biased estimation due to non-representative selection of training data and subjective a-priori knowledge. Instead regression estimator approach combining remote sensing information with a rigorous ground sampling can result in an accurate assessment of crop acreage. In this study to produce the crop statistics, the area frame sampling approach is adapted to the strip-like cropping pattern on the North China Plain. Remote sensing information is used to perform a cost-efficient stratification from which no-agricultural areas are excluded from ground survey. This information is also included in a later stage as an auxiliary estimator in regression analysis. The results showed that the integration of remote sensing information as an auxiliary estimator can improve the confidence of estimation by reducing the variance of the estimates.

AB The strategic management of agricultural lands involves crop field monitoring each year. Crop discrimination via remote sensing is a complex task, especially if different crops have a similar spectral response and cropping pattern. In such cases, crop identification could be improved by combining object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods. In this investigation, we evaluated the C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network methods, both as single classifiers and combined in a hierarchical classification, for the mapping of nine major summer crops (both woody and herbaceous) from ASTER satellite images captured in two different dates. Each method was built with different combinations of spectral and textural features obtained after the segmentation of the remote images in an object-based framework. As single classifiers, MLP and SVM obtained maximum overall accuracy of 88%, slightly higher than LR (86%) and notably higher than C4.5 (79%). The SVM+SVM classifier (best method) improved these results to 89%. In most cases, the hierarchical classifiers considerably increased the accuracy of the most poorly classified class (minimum sensitivity). The SVM+SVM method offered a significant improvement in classification accuracy for all of the studied crops compared to the conventional decision tree classifier, ranging between 4% for safflower and 29% for corn, which suggests the application of object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods in complex crop classification tasks.

AB The Advanced Satellite with New system ARchitecture for Observation-2 (ASNARO-2), which carries the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (XSAR), was launched on 17 January 2018 and is expected to be used to supplement data provided by larger satellites. Land cover classification is one of the most common applications of remote sensing, and the results provide a reliable resource for agricultural field management and estimating potential harvests. This paper describes the results of the first experiments in which ASNARO-2 XSAR data were applied for agricultural crop classification. In previous studies, Sentinel-1 C-SAR data have been widely utilized to identify crop types. Comparisons between ASNARO-2 XSAR and Sentinel-1 C-SAR using data obtained in June and August 2018 were conducted to identify five crop types (beans, beetroot, maize, potato, and winter wheat), and the combination of these data was also tested. To assess the potential for accurate crop classification, some radar vegetation indices were calculated from the backscattering coefficients for two dates. In addition, the potential of each type of SAR data was evaluated using four popular supervised learning models: Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multilayer feedforward neural network (FNN), and kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM). The combination of ASNARO-2 XSAR and Sentinel-1 C-SAR data was effective, and overall classification accuracies of 85.4 +/- 1.8% were achieved using SVM.

AB The application of remote sensing to crop identification for crop monitoring has gained popularity in the past decade. Given many successful examples, however, the time required for data processing remains a challenge. In response, a multi-crop identification model was developed based on stepwise removal learning-support vector machine (SR-SVM) using remote sensing images. This classifier was constructed using a binary tree (BT) structure. In each layer it applies the SR learning algorithm with SVM to classification which reduces the calculation complexity and sample training time. The classification accuracies, however, are not affected. By adopting the new SR-SVM model, the efficiency of the multi-crop identification is improved.

AB There is a growing interest in monitoring land usage using remote sensing data. Besides, sometimes it is very important to find out irrigation patterns in order to have additional data for local water management agencies. That applies in the basin of river Vinalopo in Spain, where water is traditionally a limited resource. However, this area presents special severe difficulties when satellite images are exploited. The typical small parcel size and the particular irrigation practice that only applies in the drought months present a challenge in a classification process. In this paper, some multi-temporal classification techniques are used to classify crops in the area of Novelda using ASTER images. Several pre-classification techniques and multi-temporal classification methods are compared in this study. The results show that some techniques provide promising results for detecting irrigated crops taking into account the adverse characteristics of the area.

AB Remote sensing applications have gained in popularity in recent years, which has resulted in vast amounts of data being produced on a daily basis. Managing and delivering large sets of data becomes extremely difficult and resource demanding for the data vendors, but even more for individual users and third party stakeholders. Hence, research in the field of efficient remote sensing data handling and manipulation has become a very active research topic (from both storage and communication perspectives). Driven by the rapid growth in the volume of optical satellite measurements, in this work we explore the lossy compression technique for multispectral satellite images. We give a comprehensive analysis of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) still-image intra coding part applied to the multispectral image data. Thereafter, we analyze the impact of the distortions introduced by the HEVC's intra compression in the general case, as well as in the specific context of crop classification application. Results show that HEVC's intra coding achieves better trade-off between compression gain and image quality, as compared to standard JPEG 2000 solution. On the other hand, this also reflects in the better performance of the designed pixel-based classifier in the analyzed crop classification task. We show that HEVC can obtain up to 150:1 compression ratio, when observing compression in the context of specific application, without significantly losing on classification performance compared to classifier trained and applied on raw data. In comparison, in order to maintain the same performance, JPEG 2000 allows compression ratio up to 70:1.

AB Crop growth information represented through temporal remote sensing data is of great importance for specific agriculture crop discrimination. In this paper, the effect of various indices was empirically investigated using temporal images for cotton crop discrimination. Five spectral indices SR (Simple Ratio), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation index), TNDVI (Transformed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and TVI (Triangular Vegetation Index) were investigated to identify cotton crop using temporal multi-spectral images. Data used for this study was AWIFS (coarser resolution) for soft classification and LISS-III (medium coarser) data for soft testing from Resourcesat-1 (IRS-P6) satellite. The mixed pixel (i.e. multiple classes within a single pixel) problem had been handled using soft computing techniques. Possibilistic fuzzy classification approach is used to handle mixed pixels for extracting single class of interest. The classification results with respect to various indices were compared in terms of image to image fuzzy overall classification accuracy. It was observed that temporal SAVI indices database with data set-2 outperformed other temporal indices database for cotton crop discrimination. Temporal SAVI indices database gave highest fuzzy overall accuracy of 93.12% with data set-2 in comparison to others.

AB Classifying cash crops through satellite based remote sensing has proved to be effective for reliable ground based agricultural statistics. In this study, frequently used simple and fast classification algorithms i.e., Mahalanobis Distance and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) are compared for classifying tobacco crops by the end of June in north-western Pakistan. High Geometric Resolution imagery of SPOT-5 (2.5m) is used as the base image for comparison over a large pilot region. Our results indicate that MLC is more accurate than its simple form Mahalanobis distance with overall accuracy of 93.91% and kappa coefficient of 0.9181. Though it is visually seen that MLC has over-estimated tobacco crops in the unclassified region but this effect is mitigated with the help of two additional classes namely 'interfering separation' and 'interfering settlements'. It is recommended to use and compare MLC for future detection of tobacco crops in north-western Pakistan.

AB Paddy rice field extraction is one of the applications of satellite remote sensing. Full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar is capable of distinguishing between crop types based on the differences in their scattering characteristics. ALOS2 PALSAR-2 data acquired in early August over a Japanese agricultural area were analyzed to distinguish paddy rice fields from other crops, such as soybean, corn, and vegetables. The scattering characteristics of these crop types were clearly different. The threshold analysis method using polarimetric decomposition parameters examined by a previous study was employed. The results exhibited misclassification of vegetable open culture fields as paddy rice fields. The effect of the variability in the structure of vegetable fields on the scattering mechanism should be considered for improvement of the crop classification method using polarimetric decomposition parameters.

AB Image time series (ITS) represent complex 3D (2D+t in practice) data that are now daily produced in various domains, from medical imaging to remote sensing. They contain rich spatio-temporal information allowing the observation of the evolution of a sensed scene over time. In this work, we focus on the classification task of ITS, as often available in remote sensing tasks. An underlying problem here is to consider jointly the spatial and the temporal dimensions of the data. We present Deep-STaR, a method to learn such features from ITS data to proceed to their classification. Instead of reasoning in the original 2D+t space, we investigate novel 2D planar data representations, containing both temporal and spatial information. Such representations are a novel way to structure the ITS, compatible with deep learning architectures. They are used to feed a convolutional neural network to learn spatio-temporal features with 2D convolutions, leading ultimately to classification decision. To enhance the explainability of the results, we also propose a post-hoc attention mechanism, enabled by this new approach, providing a semantic map giving some insights for the taken decision. Deep-STaR is evaluated on a remote sensing application, for the classification of agricultural crops from satellite ITS. The results highlight the benefice of this method, compared to the literature, and its interest to make easier the interpretation of ITS to understand spatio-temporal phenomena.

AB The delineation of shifting cultivation landscapes using remote sensing in mountainous regions is challenging. On the one hand, there are difficulties related to the distinction of forest and fallow forest classes as occurring in a shifting cultivation landscape in mountainous regions. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the shifting cultivation system poses problems to the delineation of landscapes where shifting cultivation occurs. We present a two-step approach based on an object-oriented classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite, Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Spectrometer (ALOS AVNIR) and Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM) data and landscape metrics. When including texture measures in the object-oriented classification, the accuracy of forest and fallow forest classes could be increased substantially. Based on such a classification, landscape metrics in the form of land cover class ratios enabled the identification of crop-fallow rotation characteristics of the shifting cultivation land use practice. By classifying and combining these landscape metrics, shifting cultivation landscapes could be delineated using a single land cover dataset.

AB The sustainable development goals of the United Nations, as well as the era of pandemics have introduced serious challenges for agricultural production and management. Precise management of agricultural practices based on satellite-borne remote sensing has been considered an effective means for monitoring cropping patterns and crop-farming patterns. Therefore, we proposed a simple and generic approach to identify multi-year cotton-cropping patterns based on time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, with few ground samples that covered many years, a simple classification algorithm, and had a high classification accuracy. In this approach, we extended the size of training samples using active learning, and we employed a random forest algorithm to extract multi-year cotton planting patterns based on dense time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data from 2014 to 2018. We created annual crop cultivation maps based on training samples with an accuracy greater than 95.69%. The accuracy of multi-year cotton cropping patterns was 96.93%. The proposed approach was effective and robust in identifying multi-year cropping patterns, and it could be applied in other regions.

TI SPOT VEGETATION multi temporal data for classifying vegetation in south

SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Satellite remote sensing has enabled the acquisition of land use/land cover and vegetation information at different spatial and temporal scales. Vegetation instrument on-board Spot 4 satellite with four spectral bands - blue (0.43-0.47 mum), red (0.61-0.68 mum), infrared (0.78-0.89 mum) and short wave infrared (1.58-1.75 mum) at a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 1 day meets the requirement of vegetation mapping at a continental scale. This study focuses on the use of multitemporal SPOT VEGETATION data for vegetation mapping in south central Asia. The basis of classification is temporal dynamics, i.e. the pattern of change of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values through a temporal domain which reflects the phenology of vegetation, crop cycle and the cropping system of agricultural practices. The temporal profile of NDVI facilitates the discrimination between different vegetation types and different types of cropping pattern.

AB In order to produce crop information using remote sensing, we use classification and growth monitoring based on crop phenology. Therefore, time-series satellite images with a short period are required. However, there are limitations to acquiring time-series satellite data, so it is necessary to use fusion with other earth observation satellites. Before fusion of various satellite image data, it is necessary to overcome the inherent difference in radiometric characteristics of satellites. This study performed Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3) cross calibration with Landsat-8 as the first step for fusion. Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance was compared by applying Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) to each satellite using hyperspectral sensor band aggregation. As a result of cross calibration, KOMPSAT-3 and Landsat-8 satellites showed a difference in reflectance of less than 4% in Blue, Green, and Red bands, and 6% in NIR bands. KOMPSAT-3, without on-board calibrator, idicate lower radiometric stability compared to ladnsat-8. In the future, efforts are needed to produce normalized reflectance data through BRDF (Bidirectional reflectance distribution function) correction and SBAF application for spectral characteristics of agricultural land.

AB Microwave remote sensing provides an attractive approach to determine the spatial variability of crop characteristics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image data provide unique possibility of acquiring data in all weather conditions. Several studies have used fully polarimetric data for extracting crop information, but it is limited by swath width. This study aimed to delineate maize crop using single date hybrid dual polarimetric Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT)-1, Fine Resolution Stripmap mode (FRS)-1 data. Raney decomposition technique was used for explaining different scattering mechanisms of maize crop. Supervised classification on the decomposition image discriminated maize crop from other land-cover features. Results were compared with Resourcesat-2, Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS)-III optical sensor derived information. Spatial agreement of 91% was achieved between outputs generated from Resourcesat-2, LISS-III sensor and RISAT-1 data.

TI Classification of wheat crop with multi-temporal images: performance of
   maximum likelihood and artificial neural networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID REMOTELY-SENSED DATA
AB The need for multi-temporal data analysis for delineation of wheat crop has been demonstrated first. It is found that Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) with the composite data of multi-temporal images is limited by the problem of large null set containing crop pixels. Therefore, for effective classification of multi-temporal images, two approaches are evaluated: (1) MLC with different strategies--sequential MLC (s_MLC), MLC with Principal Components (pca_MLC) and iterative MLC (i_MLC); and (2) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with back-propagation method. These classifiers were applied on multi-temporal Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS)-1B images to classify wheat crop in two areas of India, one with dominant wheat and the other with less dominant wheat cultivation. Among the three strategies of MLC, i_MLC has resulted in relatively better classification of wheat. However, the result of ANN classification is superior to that of i_MLC with respect to the correctness of labelling of wheat pixels. The performance of ANN is proved to be better, in both the situations of dominant wheat and less dominant wheat cultivation.

AB We consider the use of remote sensing for large-scale monitoring of agricultural land use, focusing on classification of tillage and vegetation cover for individual field parcels across large spatial areas. From the perspective of remote sensing and modelling, field parcels are challenging as objects of interest due to highly varying shape and size but relatively uniform pixel content and texture. To model such areas we need representations that can be reliably estimated already for small parcels and that are invariant to the size of the parcel. We propose representing the parcels using density estimates of remote imaging pixels and provide a computational pipeline that combines the representation with arbitrary supervised learning algorithms, while allowing easy integration of multiple imaging sources. We demonstrate the method in the task of the automatic monitoring of autumn tillage method and vegetation cover of Finnish crop fields, based on the integrated analysis of intensity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarity bands of the Sentinel-1 satellite and spectral indices calculated from Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. We use a collection of 127,757 field parcels monitored in April 2018 and annotated to six tillage method and vegetation cover classes, reaching 70% classification accuracy for test parcels when using both SAR and multispectral data. Besides this task, the method could also directly be applied for other agricultural monitoring tasks, such as crop yield prediction.

AB Agricultural drought given the significant impacts on social economy and human living, the research on agricultural drought monitoring has been paid broad attention by many scholars. Development of remote sensing technology provides a potential opportunity for effective and real-time agricultural drought monitoring. Vegetation index, as one of the most important parameters to characterize vegetation growth and monitor vegetation change, can effectively monitor and evaluate the crop drought status. High resolution vegetation index time series can not only monitor the feature of changes of affected time, but also can extract the area of crop drought disaster accurately and exactly. However, due to cloud pollution, satellite revisit cycle, sensor design limitations and other factors, it is difficult for a single remote sensing sensor to simultaneously acquire high spatial-temporal images. So, it is urgent to get high spatial and temporal data which can be built by fusion algorithm. In this paper, the time series curve of vegetation index was constructed, and the drought area of crops was extracted by using the time series curve characteristics of maize vegetation index in drought-affected and non-drought-affected years. The overall classification accuracy was 90.03%.

AB Crop type data are an important piece of information for many applications in agriculture. Extracting crop type using remote sensing is not easy because multiple crops are usually planted into small parcels with limited availability of satellite images due to weather conditions. In this research, we aim at producing crop maps for areas with abundant rainfall and small-sized parcels by making full use of Landsat 8 and HJ-1 charge-coupled device (CCD) data. We masked out non-vegetation areas by using Landsat 8 images and then extracted a crop map from a long-term time-series of HJ-1 CCD satellite images acquired at 30-m spatial resolution and two-day temporal resolution. To increase accuracy, four key phenological metrics of crops were extracted from time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index curves plotted from the HJ-1 CCD images. These phenological metrics were used to further identify each of the crop types with less, but easier to access, ancillary field survey data. We used crop area data from the Jingzhou statistical yearbook and 5.8-m spatial resolution ZY-3 satellite images to perform an accuracy assessment. The results show that our classification accuracy was 92% when compared with the highly accurate but limited ZY-3 images and matched up to 80% to the statistical crop areas.

AB The establishment and application of a spectral library is a critical step in the standardization and automation of remote sensing interpretation and mapping. Currently, most spectral libraries are designed to support the classification of land cover types, whereas few are dedicated to agricultural remote sensing monitoring. Here, we gathered spectral observation data on plants in multiple experimental scenarios into a spectral database to investigate methods for crop classification (16 crop species) and status monitoring (tea plant and rice growth). We proposed a set of screening methods for spectral features related to plant classification and status monitoring (band reflectance, vegetation index, spectral differentiation, spectral continuum characteristics) that are based on ISODATA and JM distance. Next, we investigated the performance of different machine learning classifiers in the spectral library application, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and a genetic algorithm coupled with a support vector machine (GA-SVM). The optimal combination of spectral features and the classifier with the highest classification accuracy were selected for crop classification and status monitoring scenarios. The GA-SVM classifier performed the best, which produced an accuracy of OAA = 0.94, Kappa = 0.93 for crop classification in a complex scenario (crops mixed with 71 non-crop plant species), and promising accuracies for tea plant growth monitoring (OAA = 0.98, Kappa = 0.97) and rice growth stage monitoring (OAA = 0.92, Kappa = 0.90). Therefore, the establishment of a plant spectral library combined with relevant feature extraction and a classification algorithm effectively supports agricultural monitoring by remote sensing.

AB Land cover classification is able to reflect the potential natural and social process in urban development, providing vital information to stakeholders. Recent solutions on land cover classification are generally addressed by remotely sensed imagery and supervised classification methods. However, a high-performance classifier is desirable but challenging due to the existence of model hyperparameters. Conventional approaches generally rely on manual tuning, which is time-consuming and far from satisfying. Therefore, this work aims to propose a systematic method to automatically tune the hyperparameters by Bayesian parameter optimization for the random forest classifier. The recently launched Sentinel-2A/B satellites are drawn to provide the remote sensing imageries for land cover classification case study in Beijing, China, which have the best spectral/spatial resolutions among the freely available satellites. The improved random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization is compared against the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) with default hyperparameters by discriminating five land cover classes including building, tree, road, water, and crop field. Comparative experimental results show that the optimized RF classifier outperforms the conventional SVM and the RF with default hyperparameters in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The effects of band/feature number and the band usefulness are also assessed. It is envisaged that the improved classifier for Sentinel-2 satellite image processing can find a wide range of applications where high-resolution satellite imagery classification is applicable.

AB Obtaining the information on the cropping system in a region accurately and timely is important for optimizing the regional agricultural resource allocation and crop layout. However, there are still technical bottlenecks such as poor spatial resolution, low precision and the lack of imagery in the application of remote sensing research in the spatial and temporal distribution of the cropping system. In this study, a more accurate remote sensing monitoring method for the regional cropping system was proposed. The imagery with wide field of view (WFV) of multi-temporal GF-1 satellite was used to construct a temporal extraction model of the cropping system, which was based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Using the method proposed in this paper, remote sensing monitoring of the main farming system in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province was carried out, which could provide reference for the extraction of the crop system in southern cloud and rain regions. The results showed that the whole crop development period of the main planting system (rice-winter wheat and winter wheat-summer maize) in the study area was covered by selecting the high time density GF-1 / WFV with 16 m resolution remote sensing imagery acquired from 2016 to 2017 as the data sources, and the complementarity of the multi-temporal imagery avoided the imagery loss caused by the cloudy climate in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. By building a mask and marking the "polluted" areas of the cloud, the interference of cloud imagery on crop information extraction was reduced effectively. In addition, the decision condition was optimized several times by the human-computer interaction, and the key parameter was determined to ensure the accuracy of the temporal extraction model. According to the result of monitoring the major cropping system in Suqian City, the overall classification accuracy was 93.56%, Kappa coefficient was 0.85 and the relative margin of error for individual crops was 7.53%, which met the accuracy requirements for application of agricultural achievements. These results showed that, in comparison with previous remote sensing methods, the method proposed in this study can monitor the regional main crop planting system accurately and can be used to monitor the cropping system based on the high-resolution imagery in multiple ripening areas. In this way, this approach will provide theoretical basis and technical support for the development of the precision agriculture, the optimization of regional cropping patterns and the efficient utilization of agricultural resources.

AB In the context of a growing interest in remote sensing for precision agriculture applications, the utility of space-borne hyperspectral imaging for the development of a crop-specific spectral library and automatic identification and classification of three cultivars for each of rice (Oryza sativa L.), chilli (Capsicum annuumL.), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) and cotton (Gossipium hirsutum L.) crops have been investigated in this study. The classification of crops at cultivar level using two spectral libraries developed using hyperspectral reflectance data at canopy scale (in-situ hyperspectral measurements) and at pixel scale (Hyperion data) has shown promising results with 86.5 and 88.8% overall classification accuracy, respectively. This observation highlights the possible integration of in-situ hyperspectral measurements with space-borne hyperspectral remote sensing data for automatic identification and discrimination of various crop cultivars. However, considerable spectral similarity is observed between cultivars of rice and sugarcane crops which may pose problems in the accurate identification of various crop cultivars.

TI Estimating crop-specific evapotranspiration using remote-sensing imagery
   at various spatial resolutions for improving crop growth modelling
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL-MOISTURE; INDEX; CHINA
AB By governing water transfer between vegetation and atmosphere, evapotranspiration (ET) can have a strong influence on crop yields. An estimation of ET from remote sensing is proposed by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility' (SAF) on Land Surface Analysis (LSA). This ET product is obtained operationally every 30min using a simplified SVAT scheme that uses, as input, a combination of remotely sensed data and atmospheric model outputs. The standard operational mode uses other LSA-SAF products coming from SEVIRI imagery (the albedo, the downwelling surface shortwave flux, and the downwelling surface longwave flux), meteorological data, and the ECOCLIMAP database to identify and characterize the land cover. With the overall objective of adapting this ET product to crop growth monitoring necessities, this study focused first on improving the ET product by integrating crop-specific information from high and medium spatial resolution remote-sensing data. A Landsat (30 m)-based crop type classification is used to identify areas where the target crop, winter wheat, is located and where crop-specific Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (250 m) time series of green area index (GAI) can be extracted. The SVAT model was run for 1 year (2007) over a study area covering Belgium and part of France using this supplementary information. Results were compared to those obtained using the standard operational mode. ET results were also compared with ground truth data measured in an eddy covariance station. Furthermore, transpiration and potential transpiration maps were retrieved and compared with those produced using the Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS), which is run operationally by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to produce in-season forecast of major European crops. The potential of using ET obtained from remote sensing to improve crop growth modelling in such a framework is studied and discussed. Finally, the use of the ET product is also explored by integrating it in a simpler modelling approach based on light-use efficiency. The CarnegieAmesStanford Approach (CASA) agroecosystem model was therefore applied to obtain net primary production, dry matter productivity, and crop yield using only LSA-SAF products. The values of yield were compared with those obtained using CGMS, and the dry matter productivity values with those produced at the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO). Results showed the potential of using this simplified remote-sensing method for crop monitoring.

AB Although advances in remote sensing have enhanced mapping and monitoring of irrigated areas, producing accurate cropping information through satellite image classification remains elusive due to the complexity of landscapes, changes in reflectance of different land-covers, the remote sensing data selected, and image processing methods used, among others. This study extracted agricultural fields in the former homelands of Venda and Gazankulu in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation. Ground truth points totaling 137 were collected during fieldwork for pre-processing and accuracy assessment. An accuracy of 96% was achieved on the mapped agricultural fields, yet the irrigated area map produced an initial accuracy of only 71%. This study explains and improves the 29% error margin from the irrigated areas. Accuracy was enhanced through post-classification correction (PCC) using 74 post-classification points randomly selected from the 2015 irrigated area map. High resolution aerial photographs of the 74 sample fields were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to give a clearer picture of the irrigated fields. The analysis shows that mapped irrigated fields that presented anomalies included abandoned croplands that had green invasive alien species or abandoned fruit plantations that had high NDVI values. The PCC analysis improved irrigated area mapping accuracy from 71% to 95%.

AB Crop monitoring using remotely sensed image data provides valuable input for a large variety of applications in environmental and agricultural research. However, method development for discrimination between spectrally highly similar crop species remains a challenge in remote sensing. Calculation of vegetation indices is a frequently applied option to amplify the most distinctive parts of a spectrum. Since no vegetation index exist, that is universally best-performing, a method is presented that finds an index that is optimized for the classification of a specific satellite data set to separate two cereal crop types. The eta(2) (eta-squared) measure of association - presented as novel spectral separability indicator - was used for the evaluation of the numerous tested indices. The approach is first applied on a RapidEye satellite image for the separation of winter wheat and winter barley in a Central German test site. The determined optimized index allows a more accurate classification (97%) than several well-established vegetation indices like NDVI and EVI (<87%). Furthermore, the approach was applied on a RapidEye multi-spectral image time series covering the years 2010-2014. The optimized index for the spectral separation of winter barley and winter wheat for each acquisition date was calculated and its ability to distinct the two classes was assessed. The results indicate that the calculated optimized indices perform better than the standard indices for most seasonal parts of the time series. The red edge spectral region proved to be of high significance for crop classification. Additionally, a time frame of best spectral separability of wheat and barley could be detected in early to mid-summer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RISK
AB The estimation of flood damage is an important component of risk-oriented flood design, risk mapping, financial appraisals and comparative risk analyses. However, research on flood loss modelling, especially in the agricultural sector, has not yet gained much attention. Agricultural losses strongly depend on the crops affected, which need to be predicted accurately. Therefore, three different methods to predict flood-affected crops using remote sensing and ancillary data were developed, applied and validated. These methods are: (a) a hierarchical classification based on standard curves of spectral response using satellite images, (b) disaggregation of crop statistics using a Monte Carlo simulation and probabilities of crops to be cultivated on specific soils and (c) analysis of crop rotation with data mining Net Bayesian Classifiers (NBC) using soil data and crop data derived from a multi-year satellite image analysis. A flood loss estimation model for crops was applied and validated in flood detention areas (polders) at the Havel River (Untere Havelniederung) in Germany. The polders were used for temporary storage of flood water during the extreme flood event in August 2002. The flood loss to crops during the extreme flood event in August 2002 was estimated based on the results of the three crop prediction methods. The loss estimates were then compared with official loss data for validation purposes. The analysis of crop rotation with NBC obtained the best result, with 66% of crops correctly classified. The accuracy of the other methods reached 34% with identification using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) standard curves and 19% using disaggregation of crop statistics. The results were confirmed by evaluating the loss estimation procedure, in which the damage model using affected crops estimated by NBC showed the smallest overall deviation (1%) when compared to the official losses. Remote sensing offers various possibilities for the improvement of agricultural flood loss estimation. However, crop prediction and loss modelling are still quite uncertain and further research is needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study shows advantages and limitations of remote sensing techniques applied to the crop discrimination using a case study. Two districts located in the Argentine southern Pampas were selected due to the summer crops development in the north area is better than the south. A stack of 12 MODIS satellite images with NDVI maximum values for the period between 30 September 2010 and 6 April 2011 was developed. In order to identify the summer crops phenology curves, an unsupervised classification was made. Confusion matrix has demonstrated the best results in the North area with Precision (P) values greater than 90% and Kappa Coefficient (K)values greater than 0.7. On the other hand, in the South area Precision values are acceptable but Kappa Coefficient offers a minimum value of 0.054.

AB Rice is the most important food crop in Taiwan. During recent decades, rice production in Taiwan has sharply declined because of industrialization and urbanization. Monitoring the areas of rice cultivation thus becomes important due to the official initiatives to ensure food supply. This study aims to develop a remote sensing classification approach for mapping double-cropped irrigated rice fields in Taiwan using time-series SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) data. Three study sites with different farming conditions in Taitung, Chiayi, and Taoyuan counties were chosen to test the new classification method. Data processing steps include: 1. filtering time-series SPOT-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform, 2. classifying double-cropped irrigated rice fields using statistical methods (i.e., correlation analysis and sign-test statistics), and 3. assessing classification accuracy. The comparisons between the classification maps and ground-truth maps in 2005 indicated that classification using the EMD-based filtered NDVI time-series data yielded more accurate results than did the wavelet transform-based filtered data.

AB Coffee, citrus and sugarcane play an important role on the national economics in terms of ''port products. Furnas region localized in Southeastern Brazil has been characterized by an increased agricultural area, mainly for coffee plantation. Several works have been carried out in Brazil with the objective of discrimination and mapping sugarcane using satellite images, but almost nothing has been done to study coffee and citrus through orbital remote sensing data. In this paper, digital image analysis was applied to TM data, bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 which are sensitive to red (B3), near infrared (B4) and middle infrared (B5 and B7) regions, Spectral discrimination and crop classification was obtained on an interactive image processing system using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Classification matrices, average performance, and percentage of reflectance are presented for all crops and channels. Results achieved for the test site show high level of discrimination (greater than 95%) among the studied crops.

AB The objective of this study is to monitor precision paddy field area and crop classification on a small town area. Monitoring of this agricultural sec tor is useful for evaluating the cultivated environmental condition, especially in mixed crop cultivated areas. This study evaluated the small town in Chungbuk, South Korea, using drone images for the years 2016. The images were acquired 15 times using the RGB and NIR sensors, respectively. Using the collaboration of drone images and smart farm map, we improved the accuracy of crop classification and crop identification. This study also evaluated the relationship between vegetation health and growth state of the study area using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The study area, Daeso town was produced by several crops such as rice, red pepper, corn, sweet potato, sesame, welsh onion, bean, tobacco, ginseng. This study acquired images using fixed wing drone from August 5 to August 6, 2016. It was found that the range of DN values of drone images by crop was different for each crop. The NDVI of this area showed the highest value in the rice with active vegetation and the value of 0 or more in the crops such as sweet potato, soybean, corn and grassland. An object-based technique is used for crop classification. The results showed that scale 250, shape 0.1, color 0.9, compactness 0.5 and smoothness 0.5 were the optimum parameter values in image segmentation. As a result, the collaborated method showed that the kappa coefficient was 0.85 and the overall accuracy of classification was 88.0 %. The result of the present study validates our attempts for crop classification using high resolution drone image and collaborated smart farm map (SFM) established the possibility of using such remote sensing techniques widely to access the difficulty of remote sensing data acquisition in agricultural sector.

AB Monitoring agriculture from satellite remote sensing data, such as multispectral images, has become a powerful tool since it has demonstrated a great potential for providing timely and accurate knowledge of crops. Detecting anomalies in time series of multispectral remote sensing images for crop monitoring is generally performed using a large sample of historical data at a pixel level. Conversely, this article presents a framework for anomaly detection (AD), localization, and classification that exploits the temporal information contained in a given season at a parcel level to detect and localize outliers using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Specifically, the AD part is based on the learning of HMM parameters associated with unlabeled normal data that are used in a second step to detect abnormal crop parcels referred to as anomalies. The learned HMM can also be used in time segments to temporally localize the anomalies affecting the crop parcels. The detected and localized anomalies are finally classified using a supervised classifier, e.g., based on support vector machines. The proposed framework is applicable to images partially covered by clouds and can handle a set of crop parcels acquired in the same season bypassing problems due to crop rotations. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic and real data, where the real data correspond to vegetation indices extracted from several multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of rapeseed crops. The proposed approach is compared to standard AD methods yielding better detection rates with the advantage of allowing anomalies to be localized and characterized.

AB Real time, accurate and reliable estimation of maize yield is valuable to policy makers in decision making. The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmers' field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35-6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service. Yield forecasting results of crop model were precise with RMSE of 255 kg ha(-1), while remote sensing showed the RMSE of 397 kg ha(-1). Overall strength of relationship between estimated and actual grain yields were good with R-2 of 0.94 in both techniques. For regional yield forecasting remote sensing could be used due greater advantages of less input dataset and if focus is to assess specific stress, and interaction of plant genetics to soil and environmental conditions than crop model is very useful tool.

AB Large-scale, high-resolution mapping of crop patterns is useful for the assessment of food security and agricultural sustainability but is still limited. This study attempted to establish remote sensing-based crop classification models for specific cropping systems using the decision trees method and monitored the distribution of the major crop species using Sentinel-2 satellites (10 m) in 2017. The results showed that the cropping areas of maize, rice, and soybean on the Northeast China Plain were approximately 12.1, 6.2, and 7.4 million ha, respectively. The cropping areas of winter wheat and summer maize on the North China Plain were 13.4 and 16.9 million ha, respectively. The cropping areas of wheat, rice, and rape on the middle-lower Yangtze River plain were 2.2, 6.4 and 1.3 million ha, respectively. Estimated images agreed well with field survey data (average overall accuracy = 94%) and the national agricultural census data (R-2 = 0.78). This indicated the applicability of the Sentinel-2 satellite data for large-scale, high-resolution crop mapping in China. We intend to update the crop mapping datasets annually and hope to guide the adjustment and optimization of the national agricultural structure.

AB Agriculture is one of the main users of soil resources. Knowledge about land use for agricultural purposes is of paramount importance. Remote sensing allows, through the processing of satellite images, obtaining data on land use and monitoring changes, which happen very quickly. Multi-temporal data represent an alternative, not often used, to improve the classification of land according to land cover. The objective of this work was to evaluate and compare the performance of two alternative classifications, one using a time series of satellite images and another using individual images, to identify land cover in the central region of Cordoba province, where soybean and corn are the major summer crops in terms of sown area and economic returns. Images used were obtained from Landsat satellite and the Maximum likelihood algorithm was used. The classification based on multi-temporal data presented high values of overall accuracy (98.92%), with a kappa value classified as excellent (kappa = 0.98). These values were higher than those found for individual scenes (overall accuracy of 91.3 % and kappa = 0.89).

AB Proper application rate of water and nitrogen fertilization are crucial factors for producing high quality potato tubers. Mapping and detecting stress at both local and regional scales by remote sensing are very important in site specific management. This work aimed to assess the ability of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery to detect stress in potato in South-Tripoli, Libya. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the response of potato to water and nitrogen deficiency. A GeoEye-1 satellite imagery was planned to be acquired at the flowering stage of potato to assess the potential of the remote detection of stress in potato. Ground reference data including soil samples, vegetation samples, water samples, chlorophyll estimates, and GPS coordinates were collected. The filed work was timed to coincide with the acquisition of GeoEye-1 satellite imagery (21st November, 2010). The results demonstrated that the GeoEye-1 image successfully detected stress within field and local scales, and therefore can be a robust tool in site specific management. A strong linear relation between RVI and NDVI derived from satellite data and potato tuber yield (r = 0.77). Strong correlations were also found between chlorophyll content of potato and NDVI derived from the 21st November image (r = 0.76). The results further showed that the Minimum Distance supervised algorithm (MDC) is an effective classification algorithm for differentiating different crops within the study area.

AB Using remote sensing data to estimate crop area is efficient to a wide range of end-users, including government agencies, farmers and researchers. Moderate spatial resolution (MSR) image data are widely used to estimate crop area. But its accuracy can't meet the demands of precision. Spatial sampling techniques integrated the strengths of remote sensing and sampling survey are being widely used. This method need large sample size which is cannot be guaranteed by remote sensing due to weather. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can be used as an effective way to guarantee enough sample size. This paper proposed a spatial sampling method using MSR image classification results and UAV transects, a stratified random sampling method was proposed, area-scale (from MSR image classification) was used as auxiliary variable to guide the distribution of UAV transects, which had proved that 2% sampling ratio can make the crop area estimation accuracy more than 95% with a 95% confidence interval.

ID TIME-SERIES; LANDSAT-5 TM; CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY; WATER
AB Greenhouse detection and mapping via remote sensing is a complex task, which has already been addressed in numerous studies. In this research, the innovative goal relies on the identification of greenhouse horticultural crops that were growing under plastic coverings on 30 September 2013. To this end, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and a decision tree classifier (DT) were applied to a set consisting of eight Landsat 8 OLI images collected from May to November 2013. Moreover, a single WorldView-2 satellite image acquired on 30 September 2013, was also used as a data source. In this approach, basic spectral information, textural features and several vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Landsat 8 and WorldView-2 multi-temporal satellite data were computed on previously segmented image objects in order to identify four of the most popular autumn crops cultivated under greenhouse in Almeria, Spain (i.e., tomato, pepper, cucumber and aubergine). The best classification accuracy (81.3% overall accuracy) was achieved by using the full set of Landsat 8 time series. These results were considered good in the case of tomato and pepper crops, being significantly worse for cucumber and aubergine. These results were hardly improved by adding the information of the WorldView-2 image. The most important information for correct classification of different crops under greenhouses was related to the greenhouse management practices and not the spectral properties of the crops themselves.

SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA English
DT Article; Data Paper
ID STATISTICS; MODEL
AB Space-based crop identification and acreage estimation have played a significant role in agricultural studies in recent years, due to the development of Remote Sensing technology. The Cropland Data Layer (CDL), which was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has been widely used in agricultural studies and achieved massive success in recent years. Although the CDL's accuracy assessments report high overall accuracy on various crops classifications, misclassification is still common and easy to discern from visual inspection. This study is aimed to identify and resolve inaccurate crop classification in CDL. A decision tree method was employed to find questionable pixels and refine them with spatial and temporal crop information. The refined data was then evaluated with high-resolution satellite images and official acreage estimates from USDA. Two validation experiments were also developed to examine the data at both the pixel and county level. Data generated from this research was published online in two repositories, while both applications allow users to download the entire dataset at no cost.

AB In crop interpretation by remote sensing, Gray distribution of crop is overlapped in some intervals. The non-target crops fall into the target crop, which would greatly increase the workload in post classification. To reduce these classification errors, and improve accuracy of clarification, maximum likelihood classification based on minimal risk is used. And the relationship between extraction rate and accuracy were analyzed. Experiments show that this method can improve the accuracy of extracting target crops, reduce the workload of the post classification, and improve efficiency.

TI Development of a crop-specific spectral library and discrimination of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
AB In the context of a growing interest in remote sensing for precision agriculture applications, the utility of space-borne hyperspectral imaging for the development of crop-specific spectral library and automatic identification and classification of three important varieties for each of rice, chillies, sugar cane, and cotton crops in Andhra Pradesh state of India has been investigated in this study. The classification of crops at variety level using two spectral libraries developed using hyperspectral reflectance data at canopy scale (in situ hyperspectral measurements) and at pixel scale (Hyperion data) has shown promising results, with 86.5% and 88.8% overall classification accuracy, respectively. This observation highlights the possible integration of in situ hyperspectral measurements with space-borne hyperspectral remote-sensing data for automatic identification and discrimination of various crop varieties. However, considerable spectral similarity is observed between varieties of rice and sugar-cane crops. This spectral similarity, if common to most of the crop species, may pose problems for the accurate discrimination of various crop varieties using spectral measurements.

AB The study is about the classification of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) crops based on spectral behavior of their plants. The hand held ground based remote sensing optical Multispectral Radiometer MSR5 has been used for this purpose. MSR5 scans a scene and gives its digital representation in 5 separate spectral bands compatible with Landsat satellite images, so the study is also applicable to Landsat images. To judge the discrimination power of five spectral bands, used as features to represent the scenes, K-means algorithm is used for unsupervised clustering of reflectance sample data set. Computational and visualization results of clustering through K-means show that MSR5 scans are good candidates for classification purpose. Supervised classification is achieved using K-nn algorithm, and 98% accurate results of classification are achieved. Choice of MSR5 for crop classification is good for two reasons: the results are accurate and the technique is an efficient way to represent an image with only five real values covering a 1.5 square meter.

DT Article
DE crop area; remote sensing image classification; area frame sampling;
   stratification; regression estimator
AB Image classifications, including sub-pixel analysis, are often used to estimate crop acreage directly. However, this type of assessment often leads to a biased estimation, because commission and omission errors generally do not compensate for each other. Regression estimators combine remote sensing information with more accurate ground data on a field sample, and can result in more accurate and cost-effective assessments of crop acreage. In this pilot study, which aims to produce crop statistics in Guoyang County, the area frame sampling approach is adapted to a strip-like cropping pattern on the North China Plain. Remote sensing information is also used to perform a stratification in which non-agricultural areas are excluded from the ground survey. In order to compute crop statistics, 202 ground points in the agriculture stratum were surveyed. Image classification was included as an auxiliary variable in the subsequent analysis to obtain a regression estimator. The results of this pilot study showed that the integration of remote sensing information as an auxiliary variable can improve the accuracy of estimation by reducing the variance of the estimates, as well as the cost effectiveness of an operational application at the county level in the region.

AB The advent of up-to-date hyperspectral technologies, and their increasing performance both spectrally and spatially, allows for new and exciting studies and practical applications in agriculture (soils and crops) and vegetation mapping and monitoring atregional (satellite platforms) andwithin-field (airplanes, drones and ground-based platforms) scales. Within this context, the special issue has included eleven international research studies using different hyperspectral datasets (from the Visible to the Shortwave Infrared spectral region) for agricultural soil, crop and vegetation modelling, mapping, and monitoring. Different classification methods (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree) and crop canopy/leaf biophysical parameters (e.g., chlorophyll content) estimation methods (partial least squares and multiple linear regressions) have been evaluated. Further, drone-based hyperspectral mapping by combining bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for multi-angle remote sensing and object-oriented classification methods are also examined. A review article on the recent advances of hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture is also included in this issue. The special issue is intended to help researchers and farmers involved in precision agriculture technology and practices to a better comprehension of strengths and limitations of the application of hyperspectral measurements for agriculture and vegetation monitoring. The studies published herein can be used by the agriculture and vegetation research and management communities to improve the characterization and evaluation of biophysical variables and processes, as well as for a more accurate prediction of plant nutrient using existing and forthcoming hyperspectral remote sensing technologies.

The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms such as Minimum Distance (MD), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Naive Bayes (NB) on an agricultural area in Tuscany (Italy). Four different scenarios were implemented in GEE combining different information such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, indices and time series. Among the five classifiers used the best perfomiers were RF and SVM. Integrating Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) slightly improves the classification in comparison to the only S2 image classifications. The use of time series substantially improves supervised classifications. The analysis carried out so far lays the foundation for the integration of time series of SAR and optical data.

AB To predict and respond to famine and other forms of food insecurity, different early warning systems are using remote analyses of crop condition and agricultural production, using satellite-based information To improve these predictions, a reliable estimation of the cultivated area at national scale must be carried out
   In this study, we develop a methodology for extracting cultivated domain based on their temporal behaviour as captured in time-series of moderate resolution remote sensing MODIS images. We also used higher resolution SPOT and LANDSAT images for identifying cultivated areas used in training We tested this methodology in Senegal and Mali at national scale Both studied areas were stratified in homogeneous areas from an ecological and a remote sensing point of view, to reduce the land surface reflectance variability in the dataset in order to improve the classification efficiency. A spatiotemporal (K-means) classification was finally made on the MODIS NDVI time series, inside each of the agro-ecological regions
   For Senegal, we obtained an updated map of crop area with a better resolution than the USAID map (which is I km resolution) and with a nomenclature more specific of the Senegal region than suggested in the POSTEL map.
   For Mali, the results showed that MODIS data set can provide a completely satisfactory representation of the cultivated domain in one FEWS zone, in combination with external data Results at national scale are being processed and will be presented at the conference

AB The objective of this work was to develop a methodology in order to use remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) to construct a sampling frame and to allocate regular segments in a region through a random stratified sampling system. The different strata were obtained through satellite image classification. In each stratum a drawing was carried out to select sample segments, which were field visited to identify the crop type and to estimate their area. In the area estimation for each crop, for the entire region, the direct expansion estimator through a semi-automated procedure was used. The methodology reduced both the subjectivity of the percentage of agricultural area estimation in the strata and the time to construct the sampling frame.

AB Groundwater has become a major source of irrigation in the past few decades in India, but as it comes from millions of individual borewells owned by smallholders irrigating small fields, it is difficult to quantify the actual irrigated area across seasons and years. This study's main goal was to monitor seasonal irrigated cropland using multiple optical satellite images. The proposed research was performed over the Berambadi watershed, an experimental site in southern peninsular India. While cloud cover during crop growth is the greatest obstacle to optical remote sensing in tropical regions, the cloud-free images from multiple optical satellite platforms (Landsat-8 (OLI), EO1 (ALI), IRS-P6 (LISS3 and LISS4), and Spot5Take5 (HRG2)) were used to fill data gaps during crop growth periods. The seasonal cumulative normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated and resampled at 5 m spatial resolution for various cropping seasons. The support vector machine (SVM) classification was applied to seasonal cumulative NDVI images for irrigated cropland area classification. Validation of the classified irrigated cropland was performed by calculating kappa coefficients for three cropping seasons (summer, kharif, and rabi) from 2014-2016 using ground observations. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.81-0.96 for 2014-2015 and 0.62-0.89 for 2015-2016, except for summer 2016, when it was 1.00. Groundwater irrigation in the watershed ranged from 4.6% to 16.5% of total cropland during these cropping seasons. These results showed that multi-source optical satellite data are relevant for quantifying areas under groundwater irrigation in tropical regions.

AB We present a hierarchical classification framework for automated detection and mapping of spatial patterns of agricultural performance using satellite-based Earth observation data exemplified for the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) in Central Asia. The core element of the framework is the derivation of a composite agricultural performance index which is composed of different subindicators taking into account cropping intensity, crop diversity, crop rotations, fallow land frequency, land utilization, water use efficiency, and water availability. We derive these subindicators from net primary productivity and evapotranspiration data obtained from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra satellite during the observation period from 2000 to 2016, as well as from cropland maps created through multiannual classification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We classified pixel-based NDVI time series covering more than 8 X 10(6) ha of irrigated cropland based on a hierarchical approach concatenating unsupervised and supervised classification techniques to automatically generate and refine training labels, which are then used to train a decision fusion classifier, achieving an average overall accuracy of 78%. The results give unprecedented insights into spatial patterns of agricultural performance in the ASB. The proposed method is transferable and applicable for global-scale mapping, and the results of this remote sensing-aided assessment can provide important information for regional agricultural planning purposes.

AB With the proper technology and access to geographical information, it is more important to spend time developing an excellent classification scheme of a remotely sensed attribute of crop and forest vigor than to spend that time collecting multiple samples of insect counts. The ability to define zones from remote sensing images of crop or forest systems provides a vastly improved capacity to assess the sample variability of insect counts. Perspectives on defining zones from remote sensing information, including an examination of some relationships between these zones and insect sample counts, are discussed.

AB Crop physiology analysis and growth monitoring are of great importance for precision agriculture. Remote sensing technology supplies us more selections and available spaces in this dynamic change study by producing images of different spatial, different spectral and different temporal resolutions. Especially, the remote sensing data of high spectral and high temporal resolution will play a key role in land cover studies at national, regional and global scales. In this paper, a new effective data structure conception, Temporal Index Image Cube (MIIC) is proposed in aid of the parameterization of multi-dimension spectral curve. MIIC is proved very useful for the dynamic analysis of vegetation. Based on multi-temporal meteorological satellite data and multi-temporal ground spectral measurements, the temporal characteristics of different vegetation physiological parameters are contrasted and analyzed from temporal index image cube. It turned out, each crop has its differentiated temporal index curve. Based on this multi-temporal index image cube, the classification and identification on various crops is very practicable. Some spectral indices perform fairly well on monitoring the growth situation of crops. But more efforts still should be made to develop new effective and general spectral index, which will be more sensible to land cover types and the growth situation, moreover, it will screen the effects of atmosphere and background to a large extent.

AB Monitoring and mapping greenhouse areas accurately using remotely sensed data is very important for urban and rural planning, agricultural yield estimation, monitoring and planning crop proportion, natural resource management, and sustainable development. The conventional techniques for greenhouse mapping are time consuming, and expensive. Remote sensing technologies are very important to extract accurate and reliable greenhouse information. The main objectives of this research are (1) to compare the performance of the supervised classification techniques including maximum likelihood (ML), and support vector machines (SVM) for land cover classification with emphasis on greenhouse detection and (2) to find out the ability of SPOT 5 satellite imagery for detecting greenhouses in selected study area Anamur district of Mersin, Turkey. The performance of classification methods, was compared by using error matrix. Overall accuracy and Kappa statistics were computed. Based on the results, SVM and MLC performances were similiar for the selected study area and SPOT 5 MS data.

AB Supervised classifications using optical remote sensing data have been used in the region of Navarre (Spain) for many years to obtain data for the elaboration of the annual crops statistics. However, cloud cover very frequent in this area limits and even prevents the use of optical data for this scope. Radar remote sensing represents an interesting alternative, since at its wavelengths, the cloud cover is transparent; not implying any limitation. Furthermore, the new generation of radar sensors (ALOS/PALSAR and RADARSAT-2 for example), incorporate significant improvements over their predecessors (or ERS-1/-2 RADARSAT-1). Finally, for crop classification, radar sensors that acquire images in multiple polarizations are particularly interesting.
   The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of polarimetric radar observations for crop classifications in central Navarre. For this, two ALOS/PALSAR observations have been used. A detailed polarimetric analysis, polarimetric signatures of different crops under dryland and irrigation conditions were the previous step to the supervised classification performed. The result crop classification was compared with reference ground data, obtaining an overall Kappa and accuracy of 0.52 and 85% respectively.

AB With the development of space satellite technology, a large number of high resolution remote sensing images have emerged. Deep learning has become an effective way to handle big data. Crop classification can estimate crop planting area and structure, and classification result is an important input parameter for crop yield model. Crop classification based on deep learning can further improve the estimation accuracy of production. In this paper, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and GF-2 data are used as data sources. Sentinel-2 data is used as training data, and GF-2 data is used as validation data. Jilin Province in Northeast of China is selected as the experimental area. The experimental area is classified as rice, towns, corn and soy. Firstly, the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and GF-2 data is preprocessed. Then, the Sentinel-2 data is used to classify crops based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group (VGG). The red edge band, multiple indexes including normalization difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and difference vegetation index (DVI) are added respectively to compare with the classification results of original multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. The final classification results using CNN and VGG are compared with the other two machine learning algorithms including support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The experimental results show that the VGG performs best in crop classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy of the crop can reach 94.8878%, and the Kappa coefficient can reach 0.9253, which is superior to the two traditional machine learning algorithms.

AB Evaluation of fuzzy based classifier to identify and map a specific crop using multi-spectral and time series data spanning over one growing season. The temporal data is pre-processed with respect to geo-registration and five spectral indices SR (Simple Ratio), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation index), TNDVI (Transformed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and TVI (Triangular Vegetation Index). The noise classifier (NC) is evaluated in sub pixel classification approach and accuracy assessment has been carried out using fuzzy error matrix (FERM). The classification results with respect to the additional indices were compared in terms of image to image maximum classification accuracy. The overall accuracy observed in dataset 2 was 96.03% for TNDVI indices, using NC. Data used for this study was AWIFS for soft classification and LISS-III data for soft testing generated from Resourcesat-1(IRS-P6) satellite. The research indicates that appropriately used indices can incorporate temporal variations while extracting specific crop of interest with soft computing techniques for images having coarser spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data.

AB Wildfires, whether natural or caused by humans, are considered among the most dangerous and devastating disasters around the world. Their complexity comes from the fact that they are hard to predict, hard to extinguish and cause enormous financial losses. To address this issue, many research efforts have been conducted in order to monitor, predict and prevent wildfires using several Artificial Intelligence techniques and strategies such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and Remote Sensing. The latter offers a rich source of satellite images, from which we can retrieve a huge amount of data that can be used to monitor wildfires. The method used in this paper combines Big Data, Remote Sensing and Data Mining algorithms (Artificial Neural Network and SVM) to process data collected from satellite images over large areas and extract insights from them to predict the occurrence of wildfires and avoid such disasters. For this reason, we implemented a methodology that serves this purpose by building a dataset based on Remote Sensing data related to the state of the crops (NDVI), meteorological conditions (LST), as well as the fire indicator "Thermal Anomalies", these data, were acquired from "MODIS" (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), a key instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. This dataset is available on GitHub via this link (https://github.com/ouladsayadyounes/Wildfires). Experiments were made using the big data platform "Databricks". Experimental results gave high prediction accuracy (98.32%). These results were assessed using several validation strategies (e.g., classification metrics, cross-validation, and regularization) as well as a comparison with some wildfire early warning systems.

AB Accurate and timely crops classification information is of great significance for arid food security monitoring and ecological management. Adding sensitive waveband and improving classification methods are the major development trends of crops classification. In this paper, we carry out crop classification study based on Sentinel 2A time-series remote sensing data, and establish an object-oriented parcel point set in study area, trying to explore the influence of using different classification features on machine learning classification accuracy. Results indicate as follows; (1) Random forest classifier can effectively integrate the benefits of multidimensional vectors such as spectral or vegetation index, all the accuracy of different groups in this study are above 89%, while the supreme overall accuracy up to 94. 02%. (2) The classification features extraction method, which was supported by object-oriented parcel point set, can resolve the issue of salt-and-pepper noise and fuzzy parcel boundary well. Meanwhile, it also improves the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning classifier, which can be demonstrated by the result that the classification accuracy of spectral group and index group increased by 3. 13% and 4. 07% respectively. (3)Red-edge features can help the classifier to capture the phenological differences and unique growth characteristics of different crops. And the introduction of the red-edge spectrum and red-edge index can improve the classification accuracy by 2. 39% and 1. 63% respectively, while the recognition ability of spring and winter wheat also improved significantly. The result of this study can be referred for the application of the machine learning method and the Sentinel 2A remote sensing data in arid agriculture remote sensing.

AB The amount of available Earth observation data has increased dramatically in recent years. Efficiently making use of the entire body of information is a current challenge in remote sensing; it demands lightweight problemagnostic models that do not require region- or problem-specific expert knowledge. End-to-end trained deep learning models can make use of raw sensory data by learning feature extraction and classification in one step, solely from data. Still, many methods proposed in remote sensing research require implicit feature extraction through data preprocessing or explicit design of features.
   In this work, we compare recent deep learning models on crop type classification on raw and preprocessed Sentinel 2 data. We concentrate on the common neural network architectures for time series, i.e., 1D-convolutions, recurrence, and the novel self-attention architecture. Our central findings are that data preprocessing still increased the overall classification performance for all models while the choice of model was less crucial. Self-attention and recurrent neural networks, by their architecture, outperformed convolutional neural networks on raw satellite time series. We explore this by a feature importance analysis based on gradient backpropagation that exploits the differentiable nature of deep learning models. Further, we qualitatively show how self-attention scores focus selectively on a few classification-relevant observations.

TI Discrimination of irrigated and rainfed rice in a tropical agricultural
   system using SPOT VEGETATION NDVI and rainfall data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID NOAA AVHRR; LANDSAT; TM
AB The classification of irrigated crops by remote sensing requires the use of time series data, since the timing, cropping intensity and duration of cropping is quite variable over the course of a year. Rice is the dominant irrigated crop in tropical and sub-tropical Asia, where rainfall is high, but is seasonal and often uni-modal. Existing crop classification methods for rice are not able to distinguish between rainfed and irrigated crops, leading to errors in classification and estimated irrigated area. This paper describes a technique, a 'peak detector algorithm', to successfully discriminate between rainfed and irrigated rice crops in Suphanburi province, Thailand. The methodology uses a three-year time series of Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) VEGETATION S10 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (10 day composites) to identify cropping intensity (number, timing and peak values). Peak NDVI is then lagcorrelated with long term average rainfall data. There is a high correlation at a 40-50 day lag, between a peak rainfall and a 'single' peak NDVI of rainfed rice. In irrigated areas, there are multiple peaks, and multiple correlations with low values for at least 90 days after peak rainfall. The methodology currently uses a mask to remove un-cropped and non-rice areas, which is derived from existing Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The method achieves a classification accuracy of 89% or better against independent groundtruth data. The procedure is designed as a second level of analysis to refine classifications using other techniques of mapping irrigated area at global and regional scales.

AB The aim of this study is to determine the most suitable date, band and vegetation indices for the crop classification by using the Artificial Neural Networks method in irrigated agricultural areas and the usage possibilities of the web-based remote sensing platform GEE. For this purpose, the crop pattern of Cifteler irrigation scheme is located in Eskisehir, Turkey has been investigated. During the study, GEE has shown ability as an extremely powerful tool for obtaining high-resolution Sentinel 2 satellite images on a very wide area, for processing these images and for the use and export of results in classification study. It was seen that, because of GEE is cloud-based, it performs tasks quickly and conveniently with a large number of servers without depending on the performance of local computers. 12 band and 21 vegetation index values for each of the irrigation parcels were transferred to the MS Excel for use in the JMP statistical program. During the study, classification was performed with Artificial Neural Networks. During the classification process, Generalized R-2 and overall accuracy calculated respectively 96% and 94%.

AB Satellite imagery is the foremost source of information to analyze and monitor land covers in several time ranges, especially over large areas. However, it is not always either freely available or easily compatible for the final users due to the different resolutions offered by sensors onboard the satellite platforms. Crop classification is an important task to control and make decisions related to the agricultural practice and its regulation. However, it is not trivial, especially for extensive areas. Thus, this paper proposes a new approach for crop classification in large areas by a combined use of multi-temporal open-source remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) satellite platforms. Having to deal with different spatial and temporal resolutions, special spatial regions (called Tuplekeys) were created within a local nested grid to allow a proper integration between the data of both sensors. Temporal variation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was the chosen input to classify crops. Moreover, due to the massive quantity of data collected, filters considering some agronomic and edaphic criteria were applied with the dual goal of decreasing redundancies and increasing the process efficiency. Out of three different machine learning classifiers analyzed, a plot-based approach was considered for the algorithms calibration while a pixel-based approach was used for the final classification process. The methodology was both tested and validated in the Duero river basin (Spain), 78,859 km(2), for the 2017 spring and summer seasons. Finally, classification outputs were analyzed throughout their overall accuracy (OA), not only for the whole basin but also for each of the Tuplekeys so that the OA spatial distribution was evaluated as well. The Ensemble Bagged Trees (EBT) algorithm showed the maximum OA, 87% and 92%, when classifying crops individually (15 classes) and grouped (7 classes), respectively, proving both the accuracy and efficiency of the developed approach.

AB One of the most critical activities of remote sensing consists of the classification process. The results yielded depend on several elements (information classes, remote sensed images, conditions of image acquisition, the spectral and spatial resolution, etc.) but, above all, on the way the classification algorithms are trained. In this work, our interest is focused on the identification of the corn crop spatial pattern in the aquifer 18(th) of the Mancha Oriental (Spain), as well as the consequences of this characterisation in the classification algorithm.

AB Accurateestimation of rice phenology is of critical importance for agricultural practices and studies. However, the accuracy of key phenological parameters extracted by remote sensing data cannot be guaranteed because of the influence of climate, e.g. the monsoon season, and limited available remote sensing data. With China Remote Sensing career advancement, a large number of independent researches and development satellites have launched. Among a new generation of middle to high resolution satellites, H.I-1 stands out. It sets fine spatial resolution (30 m), multi -spectral and high temporal resolution (2 -day for constellation) with 360 km swath in a fusion technology with strategic significance. The time -series vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the 2 band Enhanced Vege-tation Index (EV[2) are widely used in the studies of crop land classification, plant productivity, phenology, and crop growth monitoring. It has been shown that Nis values are relatively insensitive to the differences in angular viewing factors and atmospheric disturbances and thereby can be used as a benchmark for direct comparison between sensors. In order to explore the adaptability of Chinese H.I-1 images in rice phenological parameters extraction, two widely used VIs, NDVI and EVI2, were adopted to minimize the influence of environmental factors and the intrinsic difference among the sensor. Savitzky-Golay (S -G) filters were applied to construct continuous VI profiles per pixel. Before phenological parameters extraction, the planting area of single-cropped rice was estimated using a stepwise classification strategy. Divided by the heading date, the growth phases of single-cropped rice can be classified into vegetative growth and reproductive growth. Because the maximum VI usually appears around the heading date, we defined the heading date as the date of the maximum VI on the VI profile. In general, the rice fields are flooded before transplanting and the VI of rice fields decreases during this period and then increases after rice planting. Therefore, we defined the transplanting date of rice as the minimal point along the VI profile. Due to the etiolation and senescence of the rice leaves, the VI decreases after the heading, and the maturation date of rice is identified by the maximum slope method. The results were validated with the field survey data collected by the local agro-meteorological station. The results showed that, compared with NDVI, EVI2 was more stable. Compared with the observed phenological data of the single cropped rice, the VI time -series had a low root mean square error (RMSE), and EVI2 showed higher accuracy compared with NDVI. We also demonstrate the application of phenology extraction of the single -cropped rice in a spatial scale in the study area. While the work is of general value, it can also be extrapolated to other regions where qualified remote sensing data arc the bottleneck but where complementary data arc occasionally available.

AB Front-line remote sensing tools, coupled with machine learning (ML), have a significant role in crop monitoring and disease surveillance. Crop type classification and a disease early warning system are some of these remote sensing applications that provide precise, timely, and cost-effective information at different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. To our knowledge, most disease surveillance systems focus on a single-sensor based solutions and lagging the integration of multiple information sources. Moreover, monitoring larger landscapes using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are challenging, and, therefore combining high resolution satellite imagery data with advanced machine learning (ML) models through the use of mobile apps could help detect and classify banana plants and provide more information on its overall health status. In this study, we classified banana under mixed-complex African landscapes through pixel-based classifications and ML models derived from multi-level satellite images (Sentinel 2, PlanetScope and WorldView-2) and UAV (MicaSense RedEdge) platforms. Our pixel-based classification from random forest (RF) model using combined features of vegetation indices (VIs) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed up to 97% overall accuracy (OA) with less than 10% omission and commission errors (OE and CE) and Kappa coefficient of 0.96 in high resolution multispectral images. We used UAV-RGB aerial images from DR Congo and Republic of Benin fields to develop a mixed-model system combining object detection model (RetinaNet) and a custom classifier for simultaneous banana localization and disease classification. Their accuracies were tested using different performance metrics. Our UAV-RGB mixed-model revealed that the developed object detection and classification model successfully classified healthy and diseased plants with 99.4%, 92.8%, 93.3% and 90.8% accuracy for the four classes: banana bunchy top disease (BBTD), Xanthomonas Wilt of Banana (BXW), healthy banana cluster and individual banana plants, respectively. These approaches of aerial image-based ML models have high potential to provide a decision support system for major banana diseases in Africa.

AB Brazil has become a major player in world soybean markets, second only to the U.S. Brazil Crop area is about 10 million hectares and is now rapidly expanding into the Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) and the Amazonian region where forested area is being converted to cropland. There is a need for accurate updated information on the newly expanded agricultural areas in Brazil and the current total production. The objective of this research was to develop an operational method for assessing soybean crop area that would facilitate developing remote sensing based algorithms for assessing crop yields in major producing areas. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite offers a good potential for assessing crop area as well as provide opportunity to retrieve crop condition parameters that can be used to assess crop yields. A three-year MODIS data set was acquired for the study and this research describes the methods used for processing the 8-day composite reflectance data from bands 1 and 2 and its use in developing the classification of soybean crop area in four major soybean producing areas in Brazil. The results suggest methods that can be used for operational application of MODIS 250m data for classification as well as potential use in crop yield assessment.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Crop classification can accurately estimate crop area, structure, and spatial distribution, as well as provide important input parameters for crop yield models. The crop yield information is an important basis for the country to formulate food policies and economic plans, so the study of crop classification is of great significance. Traditional optical remote sensing is susceptible to sunlight and clouds, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be used all-time and all-weather. Compared to single-polarization SAR, full-polarization SAR has more abundant information. In this paper, C-band GF-3(GaoFen-3) satellite data and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data were used as data sources. Changchun City in northeastern China is selected as the experimental area and the scattering characteristics of typical crops in this area are analyzed. Firstly, the GF-3 and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data were preprocessed. Then, polarization decomposition of GF-3 data was performed to obtain three polarization characteristics: scattering angle, entropy and anisotropy (H/alpha/A). The Supports vector machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented as the classifier. Polarization characteristics, multi-source and multi-temporal SAR were used for classification features. The overall accuracy reached 91.9537%, nearly 10% higher than using full-polarization information alone, and the kappa coefficient was 0.8827. It shows that multi-source and multi-temporal SAR has obvious advantages in crop identification.

AB Monitoring of agricultural regions is an important task. Recent trends to solve it are based on applying multi-temporal remote sensing in order to obtain reliable crop classification maps. If a radar remote sensing is used, speckle presence in the original data reduces a classification accuracy. A negative impact of speckle can be reduced by image pre-filtering procedure. Recent studies carried out for Sentinel-1 imagery have shown that more efficient pre-filtering usually results in better classification. Thus, here we propose a modification of block matching three-dimensional (BM3D) filter adapted to the properties of Sentinel-1 radar data. We demonstrate that its use leads to improved classification of crops in agricultural region of Ukraine compared to earlier methods which are based on other filters. Additionally, a convolutional neural network approach for crop mapping is investigated in this paper for decreasing noise impact and is compared with a traditional pixel-based multi-layer perceptron.

AB With the development of remote sensing technology, its applications in agriculture monitoring systems, crop mapping accuracy, and spatial distribution are more and more being explored by administrators and users. Uncertainty in crop mapping is profoundly affected by the spatial pattern of spectral reflectance values obtained from the applied remote sensing data. Errors in remotely sensed crop cover information and the propagation in derivative products need to be quantified and handled correctly. Therefore, this study discusses the methods of error modeling for uncertainty characterization in crop mapping using GF-1 multispectral imagery. An error modeling framework based on geostatistics is proposed, which introduced the sequential Gaussian simulation algorithm to explore the relationship between classification errors and the spectral signature from remote sensing data source. On this basis, a misclassification probability model to produce a spatially explicit classification error probability surface for the map of a crop is developed, which realizes the uncertainty characterization for crop mapping. In this process, trend surface analysis was carried out to generate a spatially varying mean response and the corresponding residual response with spatial variation for the spectral bands of GF-1 multispectral imagery. Variogram models were employed to measure the spatial dependence in the spectral bands and the derived misclassification probability surfaces. Simulated spectral data and classification results were quantitatively analyzed. Through experiments using data sets from a region in the low rolling country located at the Yangtze River valley, it was found that GF-1 multispectral imagery can be used for crop mapping with a good overall performance, the proposal error modeling framework can be used to quantify the uncertainty in crop mapping, and the misclassification probability model can summarize the spatial variation in map accuracy and is helpful for satisfying the need for reliable local estimates for detailed precision management planting.

AB Machine learning in association with remote sensing has assisted agricultural specialists in monitoring, classification and yield estimation of crops. Tobacco is a major taxable crop of Pakistan, however the existing traditional methods for its monitoring and yield estimation are not only expensive and time consuming but also have limitations in terms of accuracy of collected data by a large number of diverse human surveyors. Due to the existence of such loopholes in the employed mechanism for tobacco crop monitoring and yield estimation, its illicit growth and distribution is on the rise. In this paper we have established a sophisticated machine learning mechanism for tobacco crop estimation using temporally stacked sentinel-2 satellite's data of Pakistan. Instead of the conventional approach of using single remotely sensed imagery for the target crop classification, we propose a machine learning based classification algorithm while keeping in view the phonological cycle of the target tobacco crop. Using the proposed mechanism, the temporal variations within the tobacco crop and its association with the variations of other vegetation is considered to improve the classification performance of the employed machine learning algorithm. Furthermore, the impact of stacking the vegetation indices derived from near infrared and vegetation red edge bands of sentinel-2 with the original sentinel-2 datasets, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Index 45 (NDI45), on the classification performance of the machine learning mechanism is investigated. Ground Truth data for training of our Artificial Neural Networks classifier, was obtained using indigenously developed survey application "GEOSurvey". Experiments were conducted using our proposed mechanism while considering various input data setups - including single date imagery, temporally stacked datasets based on phonological cycle of tobacco crop and different combinations of NDVI and NDI45 stacking. Our proposed experimental setup consisting of temporally stacked imagery along with NDVI stacking results in the best classification performance of 95.81% with reference to the single date imagery stacked with NDVI and NDI45, with performance gain of 07.32%.

AB This paper examines the use of remote sensing satellite data to predict food shortages among different categories of households in famine-prone areas. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall estimate data, which can be derived from multi-spectral satellite radiometer images, has long been used to predict crop yields and hence famine. This gives an overall prediction of food insecurity in an area, though in a heterogeneous population it does not directly predict which sectors of society or households are most at risk.
   In this work we use information on 3094 households across Uganda collected between 2004-2005. We describe a method for clustering households in such a way that the cluster decision boundaries are both relevant for improved-specificity famine prediction and are easily communicated. We then give classification results for predicting food security status at a household level given different combinations of satellite data, demographic data, and household category indices found by our clustering method. The food security classification performance of this model demonstrates the potential of this approach for making predictions of famine for specific areas and demographic groups.

AB Identification of crops is an important topic in the agricultural domain. Hyperspectral remote sensing data are very useful for crop feature extraction and classification. Remote sensing data is an unstructured data and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can work on unstructured data efficiently. This paper presents an evaluation of CNN for crop classification using the Indian Pines standard dataset obtained from the AVIRIS sensor and the study area dataset obtained from the EO-1hyperion sensor. Optimized CNN has been tuned by training the model on different parameters. It has been compared with two classification algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Autoencoder. According to the test results, the proposed optimized CNN model provided better results as compared to the other two methods. CNN has given 97 +/- 0.58% overall accuracy for the Indian Pines standard dataset and 78 +/- 2.43% for our study area dataset.

AB Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing is becoming increasingly integrated into monitoring and management applications on large spatial scales. The main advantage of hyperspectral remote sensing is the high spectral resolution, which enables classification/separation of objects, which may appear very similar to the human eye. An example of similar objects is growing agricultural crops with/without emerging pest infestations. In agricultural fields, accurate detection of hotspots with emerging pest infestations can be used to optimize precision-agriculture such as spot treatments with pesticides and/or spatio-temporal releases of natural enemies to control pest species. Despite the significant potential associated with the integration of airborne remote sensing into monitoring and management of crops in agriculture, and many other industry sectors, the widespread use of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data is constrained by a critically important challenge the non-linear dynamics of weather, source-sensor geometry, solar light intensity, and scattering. That is, the sensitivity of hyper spectral remote sensing data is, on one hand, the clear advantage of this technology, but it is also its limitation unless it is possible to correct the radiometric signals and minimize the effects of varying weather, goniometry, solar illumination, and scattering. Under the assumption of correcting airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data, it is possible to acquire "pure" reflectance profiles from target objects. Such advanced reflectance calibration of airborne remote sensing data to obtain "pure" hyperspectral reflectance will greatly improve both the robustness of input data and the sensitivity of classification algorithms.

AB To extract regional winter wheat planting area using higher-resolution satellite imagery still faces many challenges due to large data size and long processing time in traditional remote sensing classification. Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud computing analysis platform based on global geospatial analysis, provides a new opportunity for rapid analysis of remote sensing data. In this study, high-quality Landsat-8 imagery was used to extract the winter wheat planting area from the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in China. The random forest algorithm was used to identify and map the winter wheat sown in 2019 and harvested in 2020, and Sentinel-2 imagery was used to verify the results. The spectral indices, texture, and terrain features of the image were derived, and their contribution to the classification accuracy of winter wheat was evaluated by scoring. Then the top nine features were selected to form an optimal feature subset. Comparing the set of thirty-four features and the optimized feature subset as the input variables of the random forest classifier, the results show that the accuracy difference between the two feature classification schemes is small, but the classification effect of all feature sets is slightly better than the optimal feature subset. The overall classification accuracy of sample plots verification was 86%-95%, the Kappa coefficient was between 0.7 and 0.85, and the percentage error of the total area was 5.42%. The research demonstrates a reliable method for mapping a wide range of winter wheat planting area, and provides a good prospect for exploring the precise mapping of other crops, which is of great significance to crop monitoring and agricultural development.

AB Accurate and up-to-date spatial agricultural information is essential for applications including agro-environmental assessment, crop management, and appropriate targeting of agricultural technologies. There is growing research interest in spatial analysis of agricultural ecosystems applying satellite remote sensing technologies. However, usability of information generated from many of remotely sensed data is often constrained by accuracy problems. This is of particular concern in mapping complex agro-ecosystems in countries where small farm holdings are dominated by diverse crop types. This study is a contribution to the ongoing efforts towards overcoming accuracy challenges faced in remote sensing of agricultural ecosystems. We applied time-series analysis of vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor to detect seasonal patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropping patterns in five townships in the Central Dry Zone of Myanmar, which is an important agricultural region of the country has been poorly mapped with respect to cropping practices. To improve mapping accuracy and map legend completeness, we implemented a combination of (i) an iterative participatory approach to field data collection and classification, (ii) the identification of appropriate size and types of predictor variables (VIs), and (iii) evaluation of the suitability of three Machine Learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and C5.0 algorithms under varying training sample sizes. Through these procedures, we were able to progressively improve accuracy and achieve maximum overall accuracy of 95% When a small sized training dataset was used, accuracy achieved by RF was significantly higher compared to SVM and C5.0 (P < 0.01), but as sample size increased, accuracy differences among the three machine learning algorithms diminished. Accuracy achieved by use of NDVI was consistently better than that of EVI (P < 0.01). The maximum overall accuracy was achieved using RF and 8-days NDVI composites for three years of remote sensing data. In conclusion, our findings highlight the important role of participatory classification, especially in areas where cropping systems are highly diverse and differ over space and time. We also show that the choice of classifiers and size of predictor variables are essential and complementary to the participatory mapping approach in achieving desired accuracy of cropping pattern mapping in areas where other sources of spatial information are scarce.

AB Large-scale crop mapping provides important information in agricultural applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the inconsistent availability of remote sensing data caused by the irregular time series and limited coverage of the images, together with the low spatial resolution of the classification results. In this study, we proposed a new efficient method based on grids to address the inconsistent availability of the high-medium resolution images for large-scale crop classification. First, we proposed a method to block the remote sensing data into grids to solve the problem of temporal inconsistency. Then, a parallel computing technique was introduced to improve the calculation efficiency on the grid scale. Experiments were designed to evaluate the applicability of this method for different high-medium spatial resolution remote sensing images and different machine learning algorithms and to compare the results with the widely used nonparallel method. The computational experiments showed that the proposed method was successful at identifying large-scale crop distribution using common high-medium resolution remote sensing images (GF-1 WFV images and Sentinel-2) and common machine learning classifiers (the random forest algorithm and support vector machine). Finally, we mapped the croplands in Heilongjiang Province in 2015, 2016, 2017, which used a random forest classifier with the time series GF-1 WFV images spectral features, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Ultimately, the accuracy was assessed using a confusion matrix. The results showed that the classification accuracy reached 88%, 82%, and 85% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. In addition, with the help of parallel computing, the calculation speed was significantly improved by at least seven-fold. This indicates that using the grid framework to block the data for classification is feasible for crop mapping in large areas and has great application potential in the future.

AB This paper proposes a model to extract feature information quickly and accurately identifying what cannot be achieved through traditional methods of remote sensing image classification. First, process the selected Landsat-8 remote sensing data, including radiometric calibration, geometric correction, optimal band combination, and image cropping. Add the processed remote sensing image to the normalized geographic auxiliary information, digital elevation model (DEM), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), working together to build a neural network that consists of three levels based on the structure of back-propagation neural and extended delta bar delta (BPN-EDBD) algorithm, determining the parameters of the neural network to constitute a good classification model. Then determine classification and standards via field surveys and related geographic information; select training samples BPN-EDBD for algorithm learning and training and, if necessary, revise and improve its parameters using the BPN-EDBD classification algorithm to classify the remote sensing image after pretreatment and DEM data and NDVI as input parameters and output classification results, and run accuracy assessment. Finally, compare with traditional supervised classification algorithms, while adding different auxiliary geographic information to compare classification results to study the advantages and disadvantages of BPN-EDBD classification algorithm.

AB Many tropical forest landscapes are now complex mosaics of intact forests, recovering forests, tree crops, agroforestry, pasture, and crops. The small patch size of each land cover type contributes to making them difficult to separate using satellite remote sensing data. We used Sentinel-2 data to conduct supervised classifications covering seven classes, including oil palm, rubber, and betel nut plantations in Southern Myanmar, based on an extensive training dataset derived from expert interpretation of WorldView-3 and UAV data. We used a Random Forest classifier with all 13 Sentinel-2 bands, as well as vegetation and texture indices, over an area of 13,330 ha. The median overall accuracy of 1000 iterations was >95% (95.5%-96.0%) against independent test data, even though the tree crop classes appear visually very similar at a 20 m resolution. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 data, which are freely available with very frequent (five day) revisits, are able to differentiate these similar tree crop types. We suspect that this is due to the large number of spectral bands in Sentinel-2 data, indicating great potential for the wider application of Sentinel-2 data for the classification of small land parcels without needing to resort to object-based classification of higher resolution data.

AB Time series of vegetation indices can be utilized to capture crop phenology information, and have been widely used in land cover and crop classification, phenological feature extraction, and planting structure monitoring. This is of great significance for guiding agricultural production and formulating agricultural policies. According to the characteristics of the GF-6 satellite's newly-added red edge bands, wide field view and high-frequency imaging, the time series of vegetation indices about multi-temporal GF-6 WFV data are used for the study of land cover and crop classification. In this study, eight time steps of GF-6 WFV data were selected from March to October 2019 in Hengshui City. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series and 10 different red edge spectral indices time series were constructed. Then, based on principal component analysis (PCA), using two feature selection and evaluation methods, stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and random forest (RF), the red edge vegetation index of normalized difference red edge (NDRE) was selected. Seven different lengths of NDVI, NDRE and NDVI & NDRE time series were reconstructed by the Savizky-Golay (S-G) smoothing algorithm. Finally, an RF classification algorithm was used to analyze the influence of time series length and red edge indices features on land cover and crop classification, and the planting structure and distribution of crops in the study area were obtained. The results show that: (1) Compared with the NDRE red edge time series, the NDVI time series is more conducive to the improvement of the overall classification accuracy of crops, and NDRE can assist NDVI in improving the crop classification accuracy; (2) With the shortening of NDVI and NDRE time series, the accuracy of crop classification is gradually decreased, and the decline is gradually accelerated; and (3) Through the combination of the NDVI and NDRE time series, the accuracy of crop classification with different time series lengths can be improved compared with the single NDVI time series, which is conducive to improving the classification accuracy and timeliness of crops. This study has fully tapped the application potential of the new red edge bands of GF-6 WFV time series data, which can provide references for crop identification and classification of time series data such as NDVI and red edge vegetation index of different lengths. At the same time, it promotes the application of optical satellite data with red edge bands in the field of agricultural remote sensing.

AB Accurate crop identification can achieve a good estimation for crop sown acreage, planting structure and spatial distribution, as well as provide key input parameters for crop yield estimation model. Due to that crop acreage information is the important basis for making national food policy and economy plan, therefore, it is very important that conduct the study on crop identification. In view of the advantages of high temporal resolution, wide coverage and low cost, remote sensing has been used in a wide arrange of earth observation activities and thus provides a useful tool for crop recognition and planting acreage monitoring at a large scale. Since the 1980's, optical remote sensing has been widely used to identify various crops, however, optical images are not often available in the key growth period of crops, owing to the cloudy and rainy weather. Thus, it has a negative effect on the accuracy and timeliness of crop area monitoring. As a new high-technology with an advantage of all-weather, all-time, high resolution and wide coverage, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely applied in agricultural condition monitoring field and thus provides a strong complement and support for crop identification in data and technology aspect. As the updating and improvement of function parameters and performance index of radar sensors, it has been an important field of agriculture remote sensing that getting the information of crop sown acreage, growing condition and yield by SAR. In this paper, according to a mainline that the development progress of radar technology in the recent twenty years, the progress of studies and applications on crop discrimination by SAR is systematically summarized, and the conclusion includes 4 aspects: the first is early studies (from the late 1980's to 2002), are characterized by using single band, single polarization and multi-temporal SAR data for crop identification; The second is crop acreage monitoring based on multi-polarization, multiband SAR data, furthermore, the section can be divided into 2 subsections: one is crop recognition by multi-polarization SAR, the other is using multiple SAR sensors to crop classification; The third is studies on improving the accuracy and efficiency of crop identification by combining SAR with optical remote sensing; The last is the studies on crop classification algorithm using SAR data. According to the summary of previous studies, the problems existing in the crop identification by SAR can be analyzed as follows: the first is that crop type identified by SAR are still single; the second is that the accuracies of crop identification are not high yet; the last is that mechanism studies on classification algorithm are lack. Furthermore, the development trends are presented in this study. Dry-land crop discrimination using SAR images under a complex crop planting structure, improving the accuracy and timeliness of crop identification by optimizing the operational parameters (e.g. polarization, frequency and incidence angle) of SAR system and combining with optical remote sensing, developing the mechanism-based algorithm of crop classification will be 3 contents urgently need to be studied in the future.

AB The European Commission introduces the Control by Monitoring through new technologies to manage Common Agricultural Policy funds through the Regulation 2018/746. The advances in remote sensing have been considered one of these new technologies, mainly since the European Space Agency designed the Copernicus Programme. The Sentinel-1 (radar range) and Sentinel-2 (optical range) satellites have been designed for monitoring agricultural problems based on the characteristics they provide. The data provided by the Sentinel 2 missions, together with the emergence of different scientific disciplines in artificial intelligence -especially machine learning- offer the perfect basis for identifying and classifying any crop and its phenological state. Our research is based on developing and evaluating a pixel-based supervised classification scheme to produce accurate rice crop mapping in a smallholder agricultural zone in Calasparra, Murcia, Spain. Several models are considered to obtain the most suitable model for each element of the time series used; pixel-based classification is performed and finished with a statistical treatment. The highly accurate results obtained, especially across the most significant vegetative development dates, indicate the benefits of using Sentinel-2 data combined with Machine Learning techniques to identify rice crops. It should be noted that it was possible to locate rice crop areas with an overall accuracy of 94% and standard deviation of 1%, which could be increased to 96% (+/- 1%) if we focus on the months of the crop's highest development state. Thanks to the proposed methodology, the on-site inspections carried out, 5% of the files, have been replaced by remote sensing evaluations of 100% of the analyzed season files. Besides, by adjusting the model input data, it is possible to detect unproductive or abandoned plots.

AB The capability of satellite and airborne remote-sensing methods for mapping Caribbean coral reefs is evaluated. Reef habitats were categorised into coarse, intermediate and fine detail, using hierarchical classification of field data (percent cover in 1 m quadrats and seagrass standing-crop). Habitats were defined as assemblages of benthic macro-organisms and substrata and were mapped using the satellite sensors Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Habitats were also mapped using the high-resolution digital airborne sensor, CASI (compact airborne spectrographic imager). To map areas >60 km in any direction with coarse detail, Landsat TM was the most accurate and cost-effective satellite sensor (SPOT XS when < 60 km). For maps with intermediate habitat detail, aerial photography (from a comparable study in Anguilla) exhibited similar accuracy to Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Landsat MSS was consistently the least accurate sensor. Maps from CASI were significantly (p < 0.001) more accurate than satellite sensors and aerial photographs. Maps with detailed habitat information (i.e. >9 reef classes) had a maximum accuracy of 37% when based on satellite imagery, but aerial photography and CASI achieved accuracies of 67 and 81%, respectively. Commissioning of new aerial photography does not appear to be a cost-effective option; satellites are cheaper for coarse habitat-mapping, and detailed habitat-mapping can be conducted more accurately and cheaply with CASI. The results will guide practitioners in matching survey objectives to appropriate remote-sensing methods.

AB Remote sensing image classification has important research significance and application value in image information extraction, ground object detection and identification, and is widely used in military reconnaissance, disaster relief, crop recognition and yield estimation and other military and civil fields. In the past few decades, scholars have done a lot of research on remote sensing image classification, and put forward multiple classification methods, which are mainly divided into supervised classification and unsupervised classification. However, with the increasement of remote sensing image resolution, traditional classification algorithms can not meet the needs for high-precision classification, and also unable to solve "the different objects with same spectrum" and "the same object with different spectrum" problem. In recent years, machine learning has made breakthroughs in image classification research. As a branch of machine learning, deep learning stands out among many machine algorithms for its applicability of learning models and accuracy of classification results. Therefore, more and more scholars apply deep learning to remote sensing image classification. In this paper, the application of deep learning in remote sensing image classification is analyzed and prospected. Firstly, the basic process of classification is summarized, and the common data sets are introduced. Secondly, frequently-used models and open source tools in application has been introduced, with the analysis of the latest application progress in rapidly developing deep learning methods. Finally, the difficulties and challenges existing in the application is discussed and the trend is prospected.

AB This paper presents the utilization of remote sensing data and techniques in crop classification in Al-Kharj area within the central region of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Landsat TM digital data was used in the classification techniques. Ten classes were observed. Some difficulties, such as mixing and overlapping of crop differentiation were encountered, however these problems were eliminated by the statistical averaging of training areas in different seasons (different Landsat TM data). Geographic information system was used to some extent to produce maps and to determine the location of farms in the study area. The results of this study can provide on economic means to apply remote sensing data for agriculture management. A further study is recommended for follow up work to improve classification and for the irrigation management in the arid region.

AB The aim of this study is to compare the classification accuracy of multispectral Landsat 8 and hyperspectral EO-1 Hyperion satellite image data of the same region for agricultural purposes. Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data is more challenging than multispectral data due to high amount of spectral information recorded in several image bands; therefore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to these images for dimension reduction. Support Vector Machines (SVM) approach was used for classification of two different data considering the successive results obtained in latest research by applying SVM. Six different land cover classes, namely maize, cotton, urban, water, barren rock and other crop types were determined in this study and training areas were selected for each class during the training selection stage. 200 ground control points were selected within 135 km(2) study area to conduct classification accuracy assessment. The overall classification accuracy of Hyperion image was found around 80%, whereas overall classification accuracy of Landsat image was found approximately 70%.

AB Cadastral information of rice fields is important for monitoring cropping practices in Taiwan due to official initiatives. Remote sensing based rice monitoring has been a challenge for years because the size of rice fields is small, and crop mapping requires information of crop phenology, relating to spatiotemporal resolution of satellite data. This study aims to develop an approach for mapping rice-growing areas at field level using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in Taiwan. The data were processed for 2018, following four main steps: (1) construct time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), (2) noise filtering of the time-series data using wavelet transform, (3) rice crop classification using information of crop phenology, and (4) parcel-based accuracy assessment of the mapping results. The parcel-to-parcel comparisons between mapping results and ground reference data indicated satisfactory results. These findings were confirmed by close agreement between satellite-derived rice area and government's statistics. Although some factors, including mixed-pixel issues and cloud-cover effects, lowered the mapping accuracies of townships along the coastline, this study has demonstrated the efficacy of using multitemporal Sentinel-2 data to create a reliable database of rice-growing areas over a large and heterogeneous region. Such a quantitative information was important for updating rice crop maps and monitoring cropping practices. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial land use information is one of the key input parameters for regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Furthermore, to assess the crop-specific management in a spatio-temporal context accurately, parcel-related crop rotation information is additionally needed. Such data is scarcely available for a regional scale, so that only modeled crop rotations can be incorporated instead. However, the spectrum of the occurring multiannual land use patterns on arable land remains unknown. Thus, this contribution focuses on the mapping of the actually practiced crop rotations in the Rur catchment, located in the western part of Germany. We addressed this by combining multitemporal multispectral remote sensing data, ancillary information and expert-knowledge on crop phenology in a GIS-based Multi-Data Approach (MDA). At first, a methodology for the enhanced differentiation of the major crop types on an annual basis was developed. Key aspects are (i) the usage of physical block data to separate arable land from other land use types, (ii) the classification of remote sensing scenes of specific time periods, which are most favorable for the differentiation of certain crop types, and (iii) the combination of the multitemporal classification results in a sequential analysis strategy. Annual crop maps of eight consecutive years (2008-2015) were combined to a crop sequence dataset to have a profound data basis for the mapping of crop rotations. In most years, the remote sensing data basis was highly fragmented. Nevertheless, our method enabled satisfying crop mapping results. As an example for the annual crop mapping workflow, the procedure and the result of 2015 are illustrated. For the generation of the crop sequence dataset, the eight annual crop maps were geometrically smoothened and integrated into a single vector data layer. The resulting dataset informs about the occurring crop sequence for individual areas on arable land, so that crop rotation schemes can be derived. The resulting dataset reveals that the spectrum of the practiced crop rotations is extremely heterogeneous and contains a large amount of crop sequences, which strongly diverge from model crop rotations. Consequently, the integration of remote sensing-based crop rotation data can considerably reduce uncertainties regarding the management in regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Finally, the developed methods and the results are discussed in detail.

AB Crop classification maps are useful for estimating amounts of crops harvested, which could help address challenges in food security. Remote-sensing techniques are useful tools for generating crop maps. Optical remote sensing is one of the most attractive options because it offers vegetation indices (VIs) with frequent revisits and has adequate spatial and spectral resolution and some data has been distributed free of charge. However, sufficient consideration has not been given to the potential of VIs calculated from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. This article describes the use of Landsat 8 OLI data for the classification of crops in Hokkaido, Japan. In addition to reflectance, VIs calculated from simple formulas that consisted of combinations of two or more reflectance wavebands were evaluated, as well as the six components of the Kauth-Thomas transform. The VIs based on shortwave infrared bands (bands 6 or 7) improved classification accuracy, and using a combination of all derived data from Landsat 8 OLI data resulted in an overall accuracy of 94.5% (allocation disagreement = 4.492 and quantity disagreement = 1.017).

AB For numerous spatial applications, land use data are of central importance and have to be available in a spatial data infrastructure for regional modeling. This also counts for the research project TR32 which focuses on SVA modeling in a regional context. The land use data should be organized in a land use information system according to international data standards providing general metadata including information about data quality. Usually, land use data are available from official sources, but they lack the desired information detail for many purposes. For example, in official land use maps, agricultural land use is generally differentiated between arable land, grassland, orchards and some special land use classes like paddy fields. For detailed (agro-) ecosystem modeling, this information resolution is rather poor. Here, disaggregated land use data which provide information about the major crops and crop rotations as well as management data like date of sowing, fertilization, irrigation, harvest etc. are needed. The analysis of multispectral, hyperspectral and/or radar data from satellite or airborne sensors is a standard method to retrieve such kind of information with remote sensing methodologies. By using a Multi-Data Approach (MDA), the retrieved information from remote sensing analysis is integrated into official land use data by GIS technologies to enhance both the information level (e. g. crop rotations) of existing land use data and the quality of the land use classification.

AB Two methods for estimating the yield of different crops in Hungary from satellite remote sensing data are presented. The steps of preprocessing the remote sensing data (for geometric, radiometric, atmospheric and cloud scattering correction) are described. In the first method developed for field level estimation, reference crop fields were selected by using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for classification. A new vegetation index (General Yield Unified Reference Index (GYURI)) was deduced using a fitted double-Gaussian curve to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data during the vegetation period. The correlation between GYURI and the field level yield data for corn for three years was R-2=0.75. The county-average yield data showed higher correlation (R-2=0.93). A significant distortion from the model gave information of the possible stress of the field. The second method presented uses only NOAA AVHRR and officially reported county-level yield data. The county-level yield data and the deduced vegetation index, GYURRI, were investigated for eight different crops for eight years. The obtained correlation was high (R-2=84.6-87.2). The developed robust method proved to be stable and accurate for operational use for county-, region- and country-level yield estimation. The method is simple and inexpensive for application in developing countries, too.

AB An Extended Support Vector Machine (ESVM), which could improve the conventional change detection methods by purifying thematic classification results and neglecting of the side effect by mixed pixel, is proposed for crop acreage measurement by multi-temporal remote sensing land cover change. The ESVM method combines the concept of hard and soft classification and divides the study objects into winter wheat, non-winter wheat and transitional areas. A case study was conducted at DaXing district of Beijing, China, and two remote sensing images from HJ-1/CCD were utilized in ESVM and conventional SVM methods to extract winter wheat area. The results showed that the crop distribution derived from the ESVM reflects reality more accurately than that from SVM. Crops acreage classified from ESVM gave lower RMSE than that from SVM in all window size. This research is therefore demonstrated a new winter wheat detection method which combines hard and soft classification with multi-temporal images.

AB Accurate and reliable information regarding crop yields and soil conditions of agricultural fields are essential for the sustainable management of agricultural areas. The increasing necessity of the food due to the high population, global climate change and rapid urbanisation, the sustainable management of the agricultural resources is becoming more crucial for countries. Remote sensing technology offers a feasible solution for gathering the cost-effective, reliable and up-to-date information about crop monitoring by using high-resolution remote sensing data. Image classification is the one of most common method to obtain information from the remotely sensed images. Despite machine learning based classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) could provide high classification accuracy, the researchers have been still working to improve the classification accuracy. Recently, the utilisation of ensemble learning approaches in remote sensing classification is the research of interest for this purpose. In this study, we implemented six different supervised classification techniques and a classifier ensemble: Maximum Likelihood, Mahalanobis Distance, Minimum Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Parallelepiped, Support Vector Machines and Winner takes-all (WTA) classification which is an ensemble based classifier. In this study, we investigated the comparative performance of the classifiers within overall and corn-class category for the study area located in Aydin, Turkey. Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used here for the SVM classification. Results demonstrate that WTA classification outperformed other classification methods whilst the Parallelepiped obtained the lowest classification accuracy 13.24%. Moreover SVM gave the second highest overall classification accuracy of 89.90%.

AB Nowadays everywhere remote sensing images are used for wide variety of applications, creation of mapping products for military and civil applications, evaluation of environmental damage, monitoring of land use, radiation monitoring, urban planning, growth regulation, soil assessment, and crop yield appraisal. A few number of image classification algorithms have proved good precision in classifying remote sensing data. An efficient classifier is needed to classify the remote sensing imageries to extract information. We have used texture based supervised classification. Here we compared different classification methods. KNN, SVM and Neural network are used. All the three classifier gives good result but neural network classifier takes long time, the time complexity is very high. Land use mapping has been done by comparing the images and area of the land used is calculated.

AB The agricultural landscape can be interpreted at different semantic levels, such as fine low-level crop (LLC) classes (e.g., Wheat, Almond, and Alfalfa) and broad high-level crop (HLC) classes (e.g., Winter crops, Tree crops, and Forage). The LLC and HLC are hierarchically correlated with each other, but such intrinsically hierarchical relationships have been overlooked in previous crop classification studies in remote sensing. In this research, a novel Iterative Deep Learning (IDL) framework was proposed for the classification of complex agricultural landscapes using remotely sensed imagery. The IDL adopts an object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) as the basic classifier for both the LLC and HLC classifications, which has the advantage of maintaining precise crop parcel boundaries. In IDL, the HLC classification implemented by the OCNN is conditional upon the LLC classification probabilities, whereas the HLC probabilities combined with the original imagery are, in turn, re-used as inputs to the OCNN to enhance the LLC classification. Such an iterative updating procedure forms a Markov process, where both the LLC and HLC classifications are refined and evolve collaboratively. The effectiveness of the IDL was tested on two heterogeneous agricultural fields using fine spatial resolution (FSR) SAR and optical imagery. The experimental results demonstrate that the iterative process of IDL helps to resolve contradictions within the class hierarchies. The new proposed IDL consistently increased the accuracies of both the LLC and HLC classifications with iteration, and achieved the highest accuracies for each at four iterations. The average overall accuracies were 88.4% for LLC and 91.2% for HLC, for both study sites, far greater than the accuracies of the state-of-the-art benchmarks, including the pixel-wise CNN (81.7% and 85.9%), object-based image analysis (OBIA) (84.0% and 85.8%), and OCNN (84.0% and 88.4%). To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first to identify and use the relationship between the class levels in an ontological hierarchy in a remote sensing classification process. It is applied here to increase progressively the accuracy of classification at two levels for a complex agricultural landscape. As such IDL represents an entirely new paradigm for remote sensing image classification. Moreover, the promising results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed IDL with wide application prospect.

AB Maize (Zea mays L.) is the second most commonly grown crop worldwide and number one staple food in Africa where it accounts for more than 50% of the energy requirements. However, despite its widespread cultivation and the significance of maize information in Africa, maize crop maps and yield forecasts are hardly available. Yet, systematic area, spatial distribution, and maize yield estimates are important in understanding and addressing food security in Africa. Objective monitoring of maize yield statisics in a systematic way is possible with remotely sensed data. However, absence of maize yield forecasts using remote sensing in Africa has been attributed to the cost of acquiring satellite imagery and the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes. The recent advances in sensors technology and availability of free high-resolution (spatial and temporal) multispectral satellite images afford an opportunity to forecast maize yield as well as mapping its spatial distribution in near real-time basis. This review gives an overview of maize yield estimation using remotely sensed information and its potential application in a fragmented and highly granular agricultural landscapes in Africa, including inherent challenges and research needs. The review was motivated by challenges faced by researchers and national agricultural statistical services agents when forecasting maize yield using conventional ground-based survey methods. These problems include, but are not limited to, restricted accuracy, and cost and time spent resulting in missed opportunities in food security early warning systems and proper developmental interventions. We conclude that by picking multispectral sensors with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, as well as appropriate classification techniques and accurate ground-truthing data, remote sensing can be a practical option for estimating maize grain yield and its spatio-temporal dynamics in heterogeneous African agricultural landscapes for designing appropriate developmental interventions and technological out scaling.

AB For the implementation of site-specific fungicide applications, the spatio-temporal dynamics of crop diseases must be well known. Remote sensing can be a useful tool to monitor the heterogeneity of crop vitality within agricultural sites. However, the identification of fungal infections at an early growth stage is essential. This study examines the potential of multi-spectral remote sensing for a multi-temporal analysis of crop diseases. Within an experimental field, a 6 ha plot of winter wheat was grown, containing all possible infective stages of the powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and leaf rust (Puccinia recondita) pathogens. Three high-resolution remote sensing images were used to execute a spatio-temporal analysis of the infection dynamics. A decision tree, using mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) results and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), was applied to classify the data into areas showing different levels of disease severity. Classification results were compared to ground truth data. The classification accuracy of the first scene was only 56.8%, whereas the scenes from May 28(th) and June 20(th) achieved considerably higher accuracies of 65.9% and 88.6% respectively. The results showed that high-resolution multi-spectral data are generally suitable to detect in-field heterogeneities of crop vigour but are only moderately suitable for early detection of crop infections.

AB World population is constantly increasing and it is necessary to have sufficient crop production. Monitoring crop growth and yield estimation are very important for the economic development of a nation. The prediction of crop yield has direct impact on national and international economies and play important role in the food management and food security. Deep learning gains importance on crop monitoring, crop type classification and crop yield estimation applications with the recent advances in image classification using deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Traditional crop yield prediction approaches based on remote sensing consist of classical Machine Learning methods such as Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN] and Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM] are deep neural network models that are proposed for crop yield prediction recently. This study focused on soybean yield prediction of Lauderdale County, Alabama, USA using 3D CNN model that leverages the spatiotemporal features. The yield is provided from USDA NASS Quick Stat tool for years 2003-2016. The satellite data used is collected from NASA's MODIS land products surface reflectance, land surface temperature and land surface temperature via Google Earth Engine. The root mean squared error (RMSE] is used as the evaluation metric in order to be able to compare the results with other methods that generally uses RMSE as the evaluation metric.

AB A red edge band is a sensitive spectral band of crops, which helps to improve the accuracy of crop classification. In view of the characteristics of GF-6 WFV data with multiple red edge bands, this paper took Hengshui City, Hebei Province, China, as the study area to carry out red edge feature analysis and crop classification, and analyzed the influence of different red edge features on crop classification. On the basis of GF-6 WFV red edge band spectral analysis, different red edge feature extraction and red edge indices feature importance evaluation, 12 classification schemes were designed based on GF-6 WFV of four bands (only including red, green, blue and near-infrared bands), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and random forest (RF) method were used for feature selection and importance evaluation, and RF classification algorithm was used for crop classification. The results show the following: (1) The red edge 750 band of GF-6 WFV data contains more information content than the red edge 710 band. Compared with the red edge 750 band, the red edge 710 band is more conducive to improving the separability between different crops, which can improve the classification accuracy; (2) According to the classification results of different red edge indices, compared with the SDA method, the RF method is more accurate in the feature importance evaluation; (3) Red edge spectral features, red edge texture features and red edge indices can improve the accuracy of crop classification in different degrees, and the red edge features based on red edge 710 band can improve the accuracy of crop classification more effectively. This study improves the accuracy of remote sensing classification of crops, and can provide reference for the application of GF-6 WFV data and its red edge bands in agricultural remote sensing.

AB Remote sensing systems based on consumer-grade cameras have been increasingly used in scientific research and remote sensing applications because of their low cost and ease of use. However, the performance of consumer-grade cameras for practical applications has not been well documented in related studies. The objective of this research was to apply three commonly-used classification methods (unsupervised, supervised, and object-based) to three-band imagery with RGB (red, green, and blue bands) and four-band imagery with RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands to evaluate the performance of a dual-camera imaging system for crop identification. Airborne images were acquired from a cropping area in Texas and mosaicked and georeferenced. The mosaicked imagery was classified using the three classification methods to assess the usefulness of NIR imagery for crop identification and to evaluate performance differences between the object-based and pixel-based methods. Image classification and accuracy assessment showed that the additional NIR band imagery improved crop classification accuracy over the RGB imagery and that the object-based method achieved better results with additional non-spectral image features. The results from this study indicate that the airborne imaging system based on two consumer-grade cameras used in this study can be useful for crop identification and other agricultural applications.

   Middle-Resolution Remote Sensing Data Based on AdaBoost
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

AB Most areas planted with sugarcane are located in southern China. However, remote sensing of sugarcane has been limited because useable remote sensing data are limited due to the cloudy climate of this region during the growing season and severe spectral mixing with other crops. In this study, we developed a methodology for automatically mapping sugarcane over large areas using time-series middle-resolution remote sensing data. For this purpose, two major techniques were used, the object-oriented method (OOM) and data mining (DM). In addition, time-series Chinese HJ-1 CCD images were obtained during the sugarcane growing period. Image objects were generated using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and DM was implemented using the AdaBoost algorithm, which generated the prediction model. The prediction model was applied to the HJ-1 CCD time-series image objects, and then a map of the sugarcane planting area was produced. The classification accuracy was evaluated using independent field survey sampling points. The confusion matrix analysis showed that the overall classification accuracy reached 93.6% and that the Kappa coefficient was 0.85. Thus, the results showed that this method is feasible, efficient, and applicable for extrapolating the classification of other crops in large areas where the application of high-resolution remote sensing data is impractical due to financial considerations or because qualified images are limited.

AB Crop growth monitoring is an important application of remote sensing. However, the crop cultivation area cannot be easily distinguished from other areas in the remote sensing data because of the various types of land cover. Therefore, the crop cultivation area should be extracted before remote sensing data can be used. In this paper, a new method is presented to extract wheat planting region. Two MODIS images representing different times were adopted according to the characteristics of the growth of wheat. The training sets selected in two MODIS images were calculated by backward cloud algorithm to generate the digital features which reflect two disparate qualitative concepts. Next, the membership grade of the NDVI value of each pixel in two MODIS images to the corresponding qualitative concept was computed. Finally, the calculation results of two images were overlapped to extract wheat planting region. Compared with other current methods of crop planting extraction based on color composition and classification, this method excels in higher accuracy, unlimited amounts of images and low workload of choosing training sets which only need to sample the crop region. Therefore, this method is suitable for large-scale crop planting region extraction.

AB In the global change context, an efficient management of the available resources has become one of the most important topic particularly for sustainable crop development. Many questions concern the evolution of the rice farming systems in Camargue, in the Southeastern France, which play a crucial role to control the soil salinity and whose the surfaces significantly decreased these last years from 20 000 ha in 2010 to around 14000 ha in 2014. The arrival of the new satellites Sentinel makes it possible to evaluate these crop evolutions. The objectives of this study were to propose operational methodologies to: 1) accurately assess the surfaces of the main crops, rice, wheat and grassland in 2016 and 2017 from classifications based on multispectral data, (2) map some agricultural practices (sowing and harvest residue burning), and (3) elaborate a farm typology for the Camargue region based on variables computed from remote sensing data to better understand the farmer strategies.

AB Knowledge of the spatial distribution of agricultural crops and crop rotation is necessary for the understanding of the farming practices concerning the long-term sustainability of agricultural production. Agricultural crops are increasingly subject to drought due to the effects of global climate change, and the same is true for Croatia due to the constant rise in mean annual temperatures and uneven rainfall distribution. Remote sensing methods have proven to be superior in the detection and monitoring of drought compared to conventional methods of observation from meteorological stations. Information on the condition of crops in the early stages of development indicates potential irregularities in the development of agricultural crops. The objective of this paper is to provide a perspective for the application of remote sensing in crop management using state-of-the-art methods. Analysis of the possible implementation of these methods in Croatia was performed on a macro- and micro-level. Spatial classification, cropland suitability multicriteria analysis, drought assessment, weed detection and crop density calculation were evaluated according to the necessary equipment and data processing segments. Remote sensing application in crop management offers a potential basis for better crop management both at the macro-level for land use planning and at the micro-level for family farms.

AB For high water usage cropping systems such as irrigated rice, the positive outcomes of producing a staple food source and sustaining the economy often come at the cost of high resource use and environmental degradation. Advances in geospatial technology will play an increasingly important role in raising productivity and resource use efficiency and reducing environmental degradation, both worldwide and within Australia. This paper reviews the current use of one of these technologies, remote sensing, with the rice-growing region in Australia as a case study. Specifically, we review applications of remote sensing in crop identification, area measurement, regional yield forecasting, and on-farm productivity monitoring and management. Within this context, consideration is given to classification algorithms and accuracy assessment, hyperspectral remote sensing, positional and areal accuracy, linear mixture modelling, methane (CH4) emissions, yield forecasting techniques, and precision agriculture. We also discuss the potential for using remote sensing to assess crop water use, which has received little attention in rice-based irrigation systems, even though it is becoming increasingly important in land and water management planning for irrigation areas. Accordingly, special attention is given to the role of remote sensing with respect to the surface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature and remotely sensed vegetation indices, and water use efficiency. A general discussion of other geospatial issues, namely geographic information systems and spatial interpolation, is provided because earth-science analysis using remote sensing is often intrinsically integrated with other spatially based technologies and aspects of geographical science.

AB The current study describes the land use and land cover dynamics in Eastern Arunachal Pradesh from 1985 to 2005 using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Landsat-MSS, IRS-LISS-I and LISS-III data for the period 1985, 1995 and 2005 were used to prepare the land use/land cover (LULC) map at 1:250K for different periods. Post-classification change detection technique for quantifying the changes for twelve major land use and land cover types was analyzed. The study signifies that the region experiences expansion in crop land and built-up area and decline in forest area. Crop land and built-up area has increased by 665.41 km(2) and 16.72 km(2), respectively, from 1985 to 2005. On the other hand, forest area has declined by 699.37 km(2) during the period. The study showed that topography and increasing population play an important role in shaping the LULC pattern. The study further revealed the importance of satellite remote sensing and GIS as an effective approach for analyzing the direction, rate and spatial pattern of land use dynamics. It is believed that this type of study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management in this part of the North East India in the near future.

AB Crop phenology is of critical importance to crop type classification, crop growth monitoring and yield prediction. Data smoothing is an inevitable procedure before extracting crop phenology from remote sensing data. This paper chose Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi Province, China as the study area to investigate the impacts of the smoothing methods on the extraction of crop phenology. Results show that the double logistic function-fitting is better in describing the overall trend of crop dynamics while the Savitzky-Golay filter can retain more details in vegetation index time series. According to ground observation data, crop phenology retrieved from remote sensing data is not very consistent with the ground observations. However, as for the first growing season, crop phenology derived from the double logistic function-fitting smoothed data tended to closer to observations, and as for the second growing season, that from the Savitzky-Golay filter smoothed data provided better results.

AB Now that the agricultural facilities are being increase owing to development of technology and diversification of agriculture and the ratio of garden crops that are imported a lot and the crops cultivated in facilities are raised in Korea, the number of vinyl greenhouses is tending upward. So, it is important to grasp the distribution of vinyl greenhouses as much as that of rice fields, dry fields and orchards, but it is difficult to collect the information of wide areas economically and correctly. Remote sensing using satellite imagery is able to obtain data of wide area at the same time, quickly and cost-effectively collect, monitor and analyze information from every object on earth. In this study, in order to analyze the utilization of satellite imagery at detection of agricultural facility, image classification was performed about the agricultural facility, vinyl greenhouse using Formosat-2 satellite imagery. The training set of sea, vegetation, building, bare ground and vinyl greenhouse was set to monitor the agricultural facilities of the object area and the training set for the vinyl greenhouses that are main monitoring object was classified and set again into 3 types according the spectral characteristics. The image classification using 4 kinds of supervise classification methods applied by the same training set were carried out to grasp the image classification method which is effective for monitoring agricultural facilities. And, in order to minimize the misclassification appeared in the classification using the spectral information, the accuracy of classification was intended to be raised by adding texture information. The results of classification were analyzed regarding the accuracy comparing with that of naked-eyed detection. As the results of classification, the method of Mahalanobis distance was shown as more efficient than other methods and the accuracy of classification was higher when adding texture information. Hence the more effective monitoring of agricultural facilities is expected to be available if the characteristics such as texture information including satellite images or spatial pattern are studied in detail.

AB Crop discrimination at the plant or patch level is vital for modern technology-enabled agriculture. Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data have been widely used for crop classification. Even though spectral data are successful in classifying row-crops and orchards, they are limited in discriminating vegetable and cereal crops at plant or patch level. Terrestrial laser scanning is a potential remote sensing approach that offers distinct structural features useful for classification of crops at plant or patch level. The objective of this research is the improvement and application of an advanced deep learning framework for object-based classification of three vegetable crops: cabbage, tomato, and eggplant using high-resolution LiDAR point cloud. Point clouds from a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) were acquired over experimental plots of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, India. As part of the methodology, a deep convolution neural network (CNN) model named CropPointNet is devised for the semantic segmentation of crops from a 3D perspective. The CropPointNet is an adaptation of the PointNet deep CNN model developed for the segmentation of indoor objects in a typical computer vision scenario. Apart from adapting to 3D point cloud segmentation of crops, the significant methodological improvements made in the CropPointNet are a random sampling scheme for training point cloud, and optimization of the network architecture to enable structural attribute-based segmentation of point clouds of unstructured objects such as TLS point clouds crops. The performance of the 3D crop classification has been validated and compared against two popular deep learning architectures: PointNet, and the Dynamic Graph-based Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN). Results indicate consistent plant level object-based classification of crop point cloud with overall accuracies of 81% or better for all the three crops. The CropPointNet architecture proposed in this research can be generalized for segmentation and classification of other row crops and natural vegetation types.

AB Fusion of spectral, spatial, and temporal information is an effective method used in many satellite remote sensing applications. On the other hand, one drawback of this fusion is an increase in complexity. In this paper, we focus on developing a fast and well-performed classification method for agricultural crops using time-series SAR data. In order to achieve this, a novel two-stage approach is proposed. In the first stage, a high-dimensional feature space is obtained using time-series dual-pol SAR data and morphological operators. Spectral, spatial, and temporal information is combined into a single high-dimensional feature space. In the second stage, a dimension reduction technique is applied to the feature vector in order to decrease time complexity and increase classification accuracy by considering the global and local pattern information in the high-dimensional feature space. The contribution of the morphological profiles to the classification performance is significant; however the time complexity is increased drastically. The proposed method overcomes the time complexity stemming from high-dimensional feature space; it also improves the classification performance. The superiority of the proposed method to the comparative methods in agricultural crop classification is experimentally shown with the improvements in both classification and time performance using time-series TerraSAR-X images.

AB Crop identification is a critical component for grain production prediction. Identifying crop type using remote sensing techniques has been investigated for many decades. A number of different supervised methods have been developed to discriminate different crops. However, most of these methods were applied to areas with relatively large cultivated fields. In China, the cultivation policy leads to extreme complexity in the agricultural landscape, especially in summer and autumn seasons. The objective of this study was to investigate the capability of multi-temporal Landsat images for crop identification in a region with high farmland fragmentation. The study area is located in Taigu, Shanxi province, where the crop planting structure is very complicated. A total of 7 Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were acquired from 14 October 2003 to 26 June 2004 for classification. Two most favorable classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) were selected for classification with training samples using different combinations of multi-temporal Landsat images. The overall classification accuracy and Kappa statistics estimated from the confusion matrix using validation samples were selected for evaluating all classification results. Accuracy assessment results indicated that multi-temporal ETM+ data achieved satisfactory classification accuracy (best overall accuracy 89.61%) in the study area. SVM classifier performed better than MLC when three or less Landsat images were used. The addition of the temporal dimension further increased the overall classification accuracy for both SVM and MLC, but the accuracy increased slightly for SVM classifier. The time of data acquisitions are of great importance for crop classification. Results in this paper indicated that multi-temporal Landsat ETM+ data are capable for crop discrimination in regions with high farmland fragmentation. In the future, the use of China Environment Satellite HJ-1A/B data for this application should be investigated in the future for the higher temporal resolution and greater spatial coverage.

DE crop acreage estimation; area frame sampling; regression estimator;
   image classification
AB Image classifications including sub pixel analysis are often used to estimate directly the crop acreage, while ground data collected during field surveys play a secondary role. This pixel counting approach often leads to a biased estimation due to non-representative selection of ground data and subjective a-priori knowledge of analysts. Instead regression estimator approach combining remote sensing information with a rigorous ground sampling can result in an accurate assessment of crop acreage. In this study to estimate the maize area, the point frame sampling approach is adapted to the strip-like cropping pattern on the North China Plain. Remote sensing information is used to perform a cost-efficient stratification from which no-agricultural areas are excluded from ground survey. This information is also included in a later stage as an auxiliary estimator in regression analysis. The results showed that the integration of remote sensing information as an auxiliary estimator can improve the confidence of estimation by reducing the variance of the estimates.

AB Crop yield estimation is important to inform logistics management such as the prescription of nutrient inputs, financing, storage and transport, marketing as well as to inform for crop insurance appraisals due to loss incurred by abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, we used a suite of methods to assess yields at the village level (< 5 km(2)) using remote sensing technology and crop modeling in Indian states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Remote sensing products were generated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series data and calibrated with data collected from farmers' fields. We derived maps showing spatial variation in crop extent, crop growth stages and leaf area index (LAI), which are crucial in yield assessment. Crop classification was performed on Sentinel-2 time series data using spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and crop management information collected from field surveys along with ground data. The locations of crop cutting experiments (CCEs) was identified based on crop extent maps. LAI was derived based on the SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index) equation were using Landsat 8-time series data. We used the technique of re-parametrization of crop simulation models based on the several iterations using remote sensing leaf area index (LAI). The data assimilation approach helps in fine-tuning the initial parameters of the crop growth model and improving simulation with the help of remotely sensed observations. Results clearly show a good correlation between observed and simulated crop yields (R-2 is greater than 0.7) for all the crops studied. Our study showed that by assimilation of remotely sensed data in to crop models, crop yields at harvest could be successfully predicted.

AB The large amount of collected data in the field of Earth Observation has created the need for automatization in processing and extraction information from it. Thus, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained popularity among the remote sensing community. Agriculture is one of the domains where DL can improve the current state-of-the-art. In this paper, we focus on the task of crop type classification, a key task in the process of assessing the agricultural market and yield. To this purpose, we introduce a new dataset, based on publicly available data (images from satellite Sentinel-2 and annotations from Land Parcel Identification System), to be used for further research in this field.

AB Population growth, climate change, and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic are imposing increasing pressure on global agricultural production. The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue throughout the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review. We hope that this work can act as a reference for the global agricultural community regarding DL in PA and can inspire deeper and broader research to promote the evolution of modern agriculture.

AB Regional estimates of crop yield are critical for a wide range of applications, including agricultural land management and carbon cycle modelling. Remotely sensed images offer great potential in estimating crop extent and yield over large areas owing to their synoptic and repetitive coverage. Over the last few decades, the most commonly used yield-vegetation index relationship has been criticized because of its strong empirical character. Therefore, the present study was mainly focused on estimating regional wheat yield by remote sensing from the parametric Monteith's model, in an intensive agricultural region (Haryana state) in India. Discrimination and area estimates of wheat crop were achieved by spectral classification of image from AWiFS (Advanced Wide Field Sensor) on-board the IRS-P6 satellite. Remotely sensed estimates of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and daily temperature were used as input to a simple model based on light-use efficiency to estimate wheat yields at the pixel level. Major winter crops (wheat, mustard and sugarcane) were discriminated from single-date AWiFS image with an accuracy of more than 80%. The estimates of wheat acreage from AWiFS had less than 5% relative deviation from official reports, which shows the potential of single-date AWiFS image for estimating wheat acreage in Haryana. The physical range of yield estimates from satellites using Monteith's model was within reported yields of wheat for both methods of fAPAR, in an intensive irrigated wheat-growing region. Comparison of satellite-based and official estimates indicates errors in regional yields within 10% for 78% and 68% of cases with fAPAR_M1 and fAPAR_M2, respectively. However, wheat yields in general are over-and underestimated by the fAPAR_M1 and fAPAR_M2 methods, respectively. The validation with district level wheat yields revealed a root mean square error of 0.25 and 0.35 t ha(-1) from fAPAR_M1 and fAPAR_M2, respectively, which shows the better performance of the fAPAR_M1 method for estimating regional wheat yields. Future work should address improvement in crop identification and field-scale yield estimation by integration of high and coarse resolution satellite sensor data.

AB With the increase of the world population, issues such as protecting natural resources and providing the sustainability of agricultural activities have gained importance. For the last four decades, observation of agricultural areas and generation of crop type maps are possible with remote sensing technologies. A commonly known method for determining the crop type is to classify satellite images and generate thematic maps, which can be useful to produce data for agriculture policies. In this study, RapidEye satellite images of Menemen District of Izmir Province were classified using both pixel based and object based methods. The vegetation indices such as NDVI, GNDVI, and NDRE have been used for the purpose of increasing the classification accuracy. As a result, 5 different data sets have been classified as; original bands of RapidEye, NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE, and the combination of all available bands together. Accuracy analyses have been performed by creating error matrices and kappa statistics. The results showed that GNDVI classified with the object based algorithm has the highest accuracy of 89.7744%. It is followed by the original bands together with all the indices, using both pixel based and object based classifications with the accuracies of 89.4486 and 89.3985%, respectively.

AB Automatic land cover classification from satellite image time series is of paramount relevance to assess vegetation and crop status, with important implications in agriculture, biofuels, and food. However, due to the high cost and human resources needed to characterize and classify land cover through field campaigns, a recurrent limiting factor is the lack of available labeled data. On top of this, the biophysical-geophysical variables exhibit particular temporal structures that need to be exploited. Land cover classification based on image time series is very complex because of the data manifold distortions through time. We propose the use of the kernel manifold alignment (KEMA) method for domain adaptation of remote sensing time series before classification. KEMA is nonlinear and semisupervised and reduces to solve a simple generalized eigenproblem. We give empirical evidence of performance through classification of biophysical (leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fractional vegetation cover, and normalized difference vegetation index) time series on a global scale.

AB Impact assessment of watershed development activity assumes greater importance in present day agriculture. Considering the ability of remote sensing technology in watershed monitoring and impact assessment, a study was carried out to investigate the Impact Assessment of Karnataka Watershed Development Project (DANIDA) in Koralahallihalla Sub watershed in Sindagi taluk of Bijapur district in Northern Karnataka using satellite data of two periods i.e., IRS 1 C, LISS-III data of 30 December, 1997 (pre-treatment) and IRS P6, LISS-III data of 17 December, 2004 (post-treatment). The land use/land cover map was derived from the supervised classification. The results revealed that there has been no major shift in cropping patterns over a period of 7 years (1997-2004). However, rabi cropped area has decreased drastically (187 ha), which might be due to the continuous droughts that occurred during the implementation period. On the other hand, kharif and double cropped area have increased marginally (103 ha and 96 ha, respectively). Increase in double cropped area showed that there was increase in irrigated land, which were earlier being used as rainfed and wastelands turned in to cultivated lands as seen in scrub lands and rabi cropped areas of the sub watershed. Wastelands in the sub-watershed has decreased marginally (36 ha). The vegetation vigour of the sub-watershed has been derived from the NDVI maps of both the periods. These NDVI maps indicate that there was a significant change in biomass status of the sub watershed. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (319 ha and 77 ha, respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing technology was 2 times cheaper than the conventional methods. Thus, the repetitive coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the land resources and evaluate the land cover changes through comparison of images for the watershed at different periods.

AB Classification of remotely sensed data to reveal the spatial distribution of crop types has high potential for improving crop area estimates and supporting decision making. However, remotely sensed crop maps still demand improvements as e.g. variations in farm management practices (e.g. planting and harvesting dates), soil and other environmental factors cause overlaps in features available for classification and thus confusion in error matrices. In this study, a variant of the sequential masking classification technique was applied to multi-temporal optical and microwave remote sensing data (RapidEye, Landsat, TerraSAR-X) to improve the accuracy of crop discrimination in West Africa. This approach employs different sets of multi-temporal images to sequentially classify individual crop classes. The efficiency of the sequential masking approach was tested by comparing the results with that of a one-step classification, in which all crop classes were classified at the same time. Compared to the one-step classification, the sequential masking approach improved overall classification accuracies by between 6% and 9% while increments in the accuracy of individual crop classes were between 4% and 19%. The McNemar's statistical test showed that the observed differences in accuracy of the two approaches were statistically significant at the 1% significance level. The findings of this study are important for crop mapping efforts in West Africa, where data and methodological constraints often hinder the accurate discrimination of crops. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Remote sensing imagery is widely used in mapping thematic classes, such as, forests, crops, forests and other natural and man-made objects on the Earth. With the availability of very high-resolution satellite imagery, it is now possible to identify complex patterns such as formal and informal (slums) settlements. However, predominantly used single-instance learning algorithms that are widely used in thematic classification are not sufficient for recognizing complex settlement patterns. On the other hand, newer multi-instance learning schemes are useful in recognizing complex structures in images, but they are computationally expensive. In this paper, we present an adaptation of a multi-instance learning algorithm for informal settlement classification and its efficient implementation on shared memory architectures. Experimental evaluation shows that this approach is scalable and as well as accurate than commonly used single-instance learning algorithms.

AB Timely and accurate information about land cover is an important and extensively used application of remote sensing data. After successful launch of Landsat 8 is providing a new data source for monitoring land cover, which has the potential to improve the earth surface features characterization. Mapping of Leaf area Index (LAI) in larger area may be impossible when we rely on field measurements. Remote sensing data have been continuing efforts to develop different methods to estimate LAI. In this present study, an attempt has been made to discriminate various land cover features and empirical equation is used for retrieve biophysical parameter (LAI) for satellite NDVI data. Support vector machine classification was performed for Muzaffarnagar district using LANDSAT 8 operational land imager data to separate out major land cover classes (water, fallow, built up, sugarcane, orchard, dense vegetation and other crops). Ground truth data was collected using JUNO GPS which was used in developing the spectral signatures for each classes. The LAINDVI existing empirical equation is used to prepare LAI map. It is found that the LAI values in village foloda region maximum LAI pixels in the range 3.10 and above and minimum in the range 1.0 to 1.20. It is also concluded that the LAI values between 1.70 and 3.10 is having most of the sugarcane crop pixels at maximum vegetative growth stage. It shows that the sugarcane crop condition in the study area was very good.

AB Rice is one of the most important crops in the world; meanwhile, the rice field is also an important contributor to greenhouse gas methane emission. Therefore, it is important to get an accurate estimation of rice acreage for both food production and climate change related studies. The eastern plain region is one of the major single-cropped rice (SCR) growing areas in China. Subjected to the topography and intensified human activities, the rice fields are generally fragmented and irregular. How remote sensing can meet this challenge to accurately estimate the acreage of the rice in this region using medium-resolution imagery is the topic of this study. In this study, the applicability of the Chinese HJ-1A/B satellites and a two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was investigated. Field campaigns were carried out during the rice growing season and ground-truth data were collected for classification accuracy assessments in 2012. A stepwise classification strategy utilizing the EVI2 signatures during key phenology stages, i.e., the transplanting and the vegetative to reproductive transition phases, of the SCR was proposed, and the overall classification accuracy was 91.7%. The influence of the mixed pixel and boundary effects to classification accuracy was also investigated. This work demonstrates that the Chinese HJ-1A/B data are suitable data source to estimating SCR cropping area under complex land cover composition.

AB Multitemporal Earth observation capability plays an increasingly important role in crop monitoring. As the frequency of satellite acquisition of remote sensing images becomes higher, how to fully exploit the implicit phenological laws in dense multitemporal data is of increasing importance. In this article, we propose a CNN-transformer approach to perform the crop classification, in the model, we borrow the transformer architecture from the knowledge of NLP to dig into the pattern of multitemporal sequence. First, after unifying the spatial-spectral scale of each multiband data acquired from different sensors, we obtain the scale-consistent feature and position feature of multitemporal sequence. Second, with adopting multilayer encoder modules derived from the transformer, we mine deep correlation patterns of multitemporal sequence. Finally, the feed-forward layer and softmax layer serve as output layers of the model to predict crop categories. The proposed CNN-transformer approach is illustrated in a crop-rich agricultural region in central California, where 65 multitemporal profiles from multisensor Sentinel-2 & x00A0;A/B and Landsat-8 are obtained in 2018. Through multiband multiresolution fusion, sequence correlation extraction of multitemporal data and category feature extraction, the classification results show that the proposed method has a significant performance improvement compared with other traditional methods.

AB Accurate mapping of land use/cover conditions provides essential information for managing natural resources and is critical for further examination of land use/cover change and its subsequent impacts on the environment. Remote sensing offers a means of acquiring land use/cover data in a timely manner, with optical remote sensing images commonly being used in land use/cover related studies. The persistent cloud cover during the rainy season in Southeast Asia, however, presents a challenge for using optical images in land use/cover mapping. Integrating multi-sensor images of different spectral domains is thus desirable because more information can be extracted to improve the mapping accuracy. The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of using multi-sensor data sets for land use/cover mapping in a tropical mountainous area in northern Thailand. Optical data from Landsat Thematic Mapper, radar images from Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and topographical data were used, providing complementary information on land use/cover. Classification and accuracy assessment were conducted for 12 different combinations of the data sets. The results suggested that short crop mapping using multi-temporal Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar images offered insights into the distributions of crop and paddy fields. Because of the mountainous environment of the study area, combining topographic data of elevation and slope into the classification greatly reduced the confusion between different land use/cover types. Improvement of classification accuracy was evident especially in separating evergreen and deciduous forests from other vegetation types and discriminating urban village and the fallow field classes.

AB This article presents a methodology that uses a fuzzy decision tree classifier and phenological indicators derived from remote sensing data for identifying major crop types in southwestern Ontario in eastern Canada. Phenological indicators were derived from time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from 250-m surface reflectance data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Training and testing samples were derived from crop classification maps at 30-m resolution for 2011, 2012, and 2013. Training samples for 2013 were used for discrimination rule development, and the classifier was then applied to all 3years. Results showed that the classifier was able to discriminate major crop types such as winter wheat, corn, soybean, and forage crops with an overall accuracy of 75.3 % for 2013 and comparable accuracy for 2011 and 2012. Confusion exists mainly between corn and soybean, and between winter wheat and forage crops. This indicates that phenological indicators derived from optical remote sensing data are intrinsic to a crop and might be more indicative than the commonly used remote sensing features that are susceptible to environmental and management impacts. This methodology provides an opportunity for discriminating general crop types without requiring a year-specific training sample set.

This research use NDVI value, meteorological data, supervised classification in remote sensing image and actual statistical data to estimate and verify the wheat and maize distribution and the relevant crop water productivity values in the Yellow River basin. The validation of the method is performed by comparing the results with the distribution of CIESIN statistic data for 1990. To obtain the accurate crop water productivity, the study used and compared two methods for calculating the total crop water productivity. The first one is to sum the crop water productivity calculated by multiplying the crop water requirement per unit area and the estimated planting total area of crops in the basin. The second one is to sum the crop water productivity calculated for each province. The research found that the remote sensing data could efficiently improve the accuracy in estimating the crop water productivity.

AB Rapid and accurate access to large-scale, high-resolution crop-type distribution maps is important for agricultural management and sustainable agricultural development. Due to the limitations of remote sensing image quality and data processing capabilities, large-scale crop classification is still challenging. This study aimed to map the distribution of crops in Heilongjiang Province using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. We obtained Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images from all the covered study areas in the critical period for crop growth in 2018 (May to September), combined monthly composite images of reflectance bands, vegetation indices and polarization bands as input features, and then performed crop classification using a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The results show that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 monthly composite images combined with the RF classifier can accurately generate the crop distribution map of the study area, and the overall accuracy (OA) reached 89.75%. Through experiments, we also found that the classification performance using time-series images is significantly better than that using single-period images. Compared with the use of traditional bands only (i.e., the visible and near-infrared bands), the addition of shortwave infrared bands can improve the accuracy of crop classification most significantly, followed by the addition of red-edge bands. Adding common vegetation indices and Sentinel-1 data to the crop classification improved the overall classification accuracy and the OA by 0.2 and 0.6%, respectively, compared to using only the Sentinel-2 reflectance bands. The analysis of timeliness revealed that when the July image is available, the increase in the accuracy of crop classification is the highest. When the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for May, June, and July are available, an OA greater than 80% can be achieved. The results of this study are applicable to large-scale, high-resolution crop classification and provide key technologies for remote sensing-based crop classification in small-scale agricultural areas.

AB Global warming, which triggers climatic changes, has direct effects on the phenology of plants. For a sustainable agricultural production, continuous monitoring of crops and trees is critical to have updated information and producing effective agricultural plans. Remote sensing is an efficient option for this purpose and is a very popular technique. Olive is an essential agricultural product for the economy of Mediterranean countries such as Turkey. Determination of olive trees, which are expanded all around Aegean and Mediterranean regions of the country, is critical to assess the production capacity and the quality of products. In this study, combinations of time series of Sentinel-1 satellite images, Sentinel-2 satellite images and NDVI products obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images are used to investigate the classification accuracy of olive trees. According to analysis results, a significant correlation with R-2 = 0.67 found between NDVI and SAR data (sigma nought VH/VV in decibel scale). This result pointed out probable accuracy improvement in classification of fused data from different sensors. In the next step, supervised random forest classification was applied on the fused data combinations and results showed that Sentinel-1 - I Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 - NDVI and Sentinel-2 - NDVI combinations achieved the highest overall accuracy with 73 %, while standalone Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series classification accuracies are 48 % and 68 % respectively.

AB Automatic land cover update was an effective means to obtain objective and timely land cover maps without human disturbance. This study investigated the efficacy of multi-temporal remote sensing data and advanced non-parametric classifier on improving the classification accuracy of the automatic land cover update approach integrating iterative training sample selection and Markov Random Fields model when the historical remote sensing data were unavailable. The results indicated that two-temporal remote sensing data acquired in one crop growth season could significantly improve the classification accuracy of the automatic land cover update approach by approximately 3-4%. However, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was not suitable to be integrated in the automatic land cover update approach, because the huge initially selected training samples made the training of the SVM classifier unrealizable.

AB The objective of the study was to examine suitable remote sensing methods and data for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in order to improve irrigation management. We compared classification results from a supervised classification method and a method using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with additional pre-classification processing. IKONOS and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were tested to see if high spatial resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages in distinguishing between active and fallow lands. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 93.63%. The results showed that the supervised classification did not have a clear advantage over the simple method using NDVI at the level of distinguishing between active crops and fallow lands. The result suggests that using ETM + instead of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate because of the high cost of IKONOS imageries and image heterogeneity of agricultural fields. It was shown that pre-processing with a mask to exclude the non-agricultural objects blended with agricultural fields is critical.

AB Pixel-based processing method mainly extracts spectral information from hyperspectral remote sensing images, but site specific management zone (SSMZ) delineation and crop yield estimation with images need to take spatiotemporal heterogeneity into account. As the spatial resolution of remote sensing data increases, the so-called "salt-and-pepper" problem of pixel-based classification becomes more serious. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of soil properties and crop biophysical parameters are mainly delineated with grid sampling and geostatistics interpolation, but the widely used method has some problems: time consuming and high cost. Satellite imageries are introduced to delineate SSMZ, but there are also problems needed to be resolved: (1) single date imagery is used to map SSMZ which is difficult to determine the optimal date for SSMZ delineation; (2) only few SSMZs were mapped, which limited application of site specific fertilizing and management; (3) pixel-based method for SSMZ delineation didn't concern the spatial relationship between pixels and site specific management does not implement at pixel level, but at SSMZ level. To improve the accuracy of crop yield estimation, a time-series of hyperspectral airborne images with high spatial resolution (1 m) of a cotton field, which is located in San Joaquin Valley, California US, were acquired and classified by using object-oriented segmentation, then yield predicting models were built, and the accuracy and stability of yield models were validated with determining coefficients R-2 and the root mean square error (RMSE). Results are as follows: (1) object-oriented SSMZ delineating method combines spectral, spatial and temporal information, reduces noises in images and yield data, improves the accuracy of yield prediction; (2) for same SSMZ number, first derivative predicting model is more accurate; (3) for same spectral input, models with fewer SSMZs show higher accuracy, which is due to spatial errors of airborne images and yield data. The results will improve monitoring methods for crop growth and yield while accelerate the application of UAV remote sensing in precision agriculture.

AB Crop phenology is dynamic as it changes with times of the year. Such biophysical processes also look spectrally different to remote sensing satellites. Some crops may depict similar spectral properties if their phenology coincide, but differ later when their phenology diverge. Thus, conventional approaches that select only images from phenological stages where crops are distinguishable for classification, have low discrimination. In contrast, stacking images within a cropping season limits discrimination to a single feature space that can suffer from overlapping classes. Since crop backscatter varies with time, it can aid discrimination. Therefore, our main objective is to develop a crop sequence classification method using multitemporal TerraSAR-X images. We adopt first order markov assumption in undirected temporal graph sequence. This property is exploited to implement Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (DCRFs). Our DCRFs model has a repeated structure of temporally connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Each node in the sequence is connected to its predecessor via conditional probability matrix. The matrix is computed using posterior class probabilities from association potential. This way, there is a mutual temporal exchange of phenological information observed in TerraSAR-X images. When compared to independent epoch classification, the designed DCRF model improved crop discrimination at each epoch in the sequence. However, government, insurers, agricultural market traders and other stakeholders are interested in the quantity of a certain crop in a season. Therefore, we further develop a DCRF ensemble classifier. The ensemble produces an optimal crop map by maximizing over posterior class probabilities selected from the sequence based on maximum F1-score and weighted by correctness. Our ensemble technique is compared to standard approach of stacking all images as bands for classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and standard CRFs. It outperforms MLC and CRFs by 7.70% and 6.42% in overall accuracy, respectively.

   Ground truth data of crop parameters were collected and related to spectral information in red, middle - and thermal infrared wavebands derived from airborne scanner data. Simple regression analysis has been used to obtain classification functions. The classified spectral images are finally compared with soil properties. Results of three years under study indicate a high applicability of airborne remote sensing technique in order to detect spatial variability of plant growth conditions on field level.

DE Burnt and non-burnt crop stubble; Crop inventory; Image segmentation
AB Soil management in crops is mainly based on intensive tillage operations, which have a great relevancy in terms of increase of atmospheric CO2, desertification, erosion and land degradation. Due to these negative environmental impacts, the European Union only subsidizes cropping systems which require the implementation of certain no-tillage systems and agro-environmental measures, such as keeping the winter cereal residues and non-burning of stubble to reduce erosion, and to increase the organic matter, the fertility of soils and the crop production. Nowadays, the follow-up of these agrarian policy actions is achieved by ground visits to sample targeted farms; however, this procedure is time-consuming and very expensive. To improve this control procedure, a study of the accuracy performance of several classification methods has been examined to verify if remote sensing can offer the ability to efficiently identify crops and their agro-environmental measures in a typical agricultural Mediterranean area of dry conditions. Five supervised classification methods based on different decision rule routines, Parallelepiped (P), Minimum Distance (MD), Mahalanobis Classifier Distance (MC), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and Maximum Likelihood (ML), were examined to determine the most suitable classification algorithm for the identification of agro-environmental measures such as winter cereal stubble and burnt stubble areas and other land uses such as river side trees, vineyard, olive orchards, spring sown crops, roads and bare soil. An object segmentation of the satellite information was also added to compare the accuracy of the classification results of pixel and object as Minimum Information Unit (MIU). A multispectral QuickBird image taken in early summer was used to test these MIU and classification methods. The resulting classified images indicated that object-based analyses clearly outperformed pixel ones, yielding overall accuracies higher than 85% in most of the classifications. The choice of a classification method can markedly influence the accuracy of classification maps.

AB Remote sensing techniques provide timely, up-to-date and relatively accurate information for the management of sugarcane crop. This article reviews the literature on the application of remote sensing to sugarcane agriculture and highlights the challenges and opportunities pertinent to the success of this application. The aim of the review was to provide accurate and fundamental information relating the spectral properties of sugarcane to its agronomic, health and nutritional status characteristics that would be of importance to cane farmers and farm managers. The applications of the remote sensing techniques in sugarcane agriculture have been undertaken with particular emphasis on sugarcane classification and areal extent mapping, thermal age group identification, varietal discrimination, yield prediction and crop health and nutritional status monitoring. It can be concluded that by selecting appropriate spatial and spectral resolution as well as suitable processing techniques for extracting sugarcane spectral information, remotely sensed data should find use in sugarcane agriculture in all areas of application with satisfactory results.

AB This paper describes an approach to accurately separate out and quantify crop dominance areas in the major command area in the Krishna River Basin. Classification was performed using IRS-P6 (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, series P6) and MODIS eight-day time series remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 23.6 m, 250 m for the year 2005. Temporal variations in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) pattern obtained in crop dominance classes enables a demarcation between long duration crops and short duration crops. The NDVI pattern was found to be more consistent in long duration crops than in short duration crops due to the continuity of the water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release, which affected the time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was, in turn, reflected in the NDVI pattern. The identified crop-wise classes were tested and verified using ground-truth data and state-level census data. The accuracy assessment was performed based on ground-truth data through the error matrix method, with accuracies from 67% to 100% for individual crop dominance classes, with an overall accuracy of 79% for all classes. The derived major crop land areas were highly correlated with the sub-national statistics with R-2 values of 87% at the mandal (sub-district) level for 2005-2006. These results suggest that the methods, approaches, algorithms and datasets used in this study are ideal for rapid, accurate and large-scale mapping of paddy rice, as well as for generating their statistics over large areas. This study demonstrates that IRS-P6 23.6-m one-time data fusion with MODIS 250-m time series data is very useful for identifying crop type, the source of irrigation water and, in the case of surface water irrigation, the way in which it is applied. The results from this study have assisted in improving surface water and groundwater irrigated areas of the command area and also provide the basis for better water resource assessments at the basin scale.

AB Climatic and environmental changes significantly influence the suitability of land for sustainable staple crop production around the world. Under climate change, droughts become severe due to the lack of precipitation, and food insecurity exists in many developing countries. Indonesia has been facing the challenges of climate change, especially in mitigating the effects of drought, and it is essential to select land that is suitable for microlevel crop production. Therefore, the aim of this research was to classify the suitable lands in drought-prone areas of central East Java of Indonesia. GIS and satellite remote sensing datasets have been used to develop a land suitability analysis based on the FAO classification. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was incorporated with expert opinion using factors and constraints, which influenced the land suitability assessments. The integrated AHP and the land suitability analysis inferred that 40.26 per cent of the study area was classified as highly suitable, 30.82 per cent were moderately suitable, and 21.89 per cent were marginally suitable for Maize Cultivation in central East Java. At the microlevel, the suitable land were further divided using a random forest classifier with high-dimensional classification features to increase the computational efficiency using k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms. The experimental results of this algorithm could effectively search the nearest classifier to increase the algorithm efficiency. This research recommends extending the machine learning approach with remote sensing and GIS to select suitable land for maize production at the microlevels in drought-prone areas.

AB A GIS-aided multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in land suitability analysis for crops was described in this study and used to suggest suitable cropping patterns for a flood prone area, the Bogra district of Bangladesh. The major objective of this study was to suggest an optimal cropping pattern to combat adverse effects of flood using integrated analysis of land Suitability for crops derived by spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). For land suitability analysis, Rice (Aman), Mustard, Potato and Wheat crops, which were prominent in the Study area, were selected for this study. IRSP6: LISS III satellite data was used to generate flood and post flood land use/land cover maps of the area. To classify the satellite datal an object-oriented digital classification procedure was performed. To generate the necessary factors and constraints for the SMCE approach, remote sensing and GIS integrated techniques and models were applied To standardize all of the factors for the MCE, the AHP method was used. The results of the suitability analysis depicted that in the study area, the land was highly to moderately Suitable for the crops. Due to the flood hazard in the flood season (Kharif), some areas were found marginally suitable for Rice (Aman). Optimal cropping patterns for the flood and post flood season based on crop Suitability and expert knowledge indicated that the Rice-Wheat/Potato, Rice (Late sowing)-Potato, Rice-Potato and Rice-Mustard combinations were found the most Suitable Suggested pattern for the Study area.

ID SOM
AB Image segmentation is one of the most challenging steps in image processing. Its results are used by many other tasks regarding information extraction from images. In remote sensing, segmentation generates regions according to found targets in a satellite image, like roofs, streets, trees, vegetation, agricultural crops, or deforested areas. Such regions differentiate land uses by classification algorithms. In this paper we investigate a way to perform segmentation using a strategy to classify and merge spectrally and spatially similar pixels. For this purpose we use a geographical extension of the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm, which exploits the spatial correlation among near pixels. The neurons in the SOM will cluster the objects found in the image, and such objects will define the image segments.

AB It is important to know cropland distribution and allocation of crop types at finer resolution in order to monitor and make plans for agricultural resource management especially in developing countries where smallholders are more vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty. Teff is one of the most staple crops in Ethiopia and it is estimated that it made up to 20% of all cultivated area in Ethiopia. This research will focus on developing a new approach to produce accurate and reliable teff distribution estimates in Ethiopia using time series remotely sensed data and household survey data. The production information from household survey and census usually are collected at subnational level and it is hard to know how the crops are distributed within the administrative unit. On the other hand, time series remote sensing data can be applied successfully in land cover classification studies but it is usually hard to identify crop types and distribution at pixel level without high quality ground truthing datasets which is very costly to acquire in at large scale in developing countries. The proposed method investigates the possibility of combining both information from household crop information (e.g. production, area) and NDVI time series in order to improve the crop allocation at finer resolution at large scale. The method developed in this study shows that available household data and satellite imagery can be used in mapping teff area. Combing information from different sources, the teff density map could be produced at higher resolution.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of multitemporal remote sensing images for crop classification. Multi-temporal Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level-1 images were acquired. The surface reflectance of visible and near infrared bands was used to represent the characteristics of crops. A time series model of surface reflectance was constructed for crop classification. Cloud cover is critical for the accuracy of classification. In order to remove the influence of clouds, the cloud pixels were neglected by setting a constant. Pearson correlation coefficient was used in the time series model of surface reflectance to classify the crop type. Finally, the overall accuracy reaches 78.26% and Kappa reaches 71.33%. Therefore, the method has the operational potential for crop classification even in the special area with cloudy or foggy weather.

AB Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) of agricultural areas derived from remotely sensed data still remains very challenging. With regard to the rising availability and the improving spatial resolution of satellite data, multitemporal analyses become increasingly important for remote sensing investigations. Even crops with similar spectral behaviour can be separated by adding spectral information of different phenological stages. Hence, the potential of multi-date RapidEye data for classifying numerous agricultural classes was investigated in this study. In an agricultural area in Northern Israel two complete crop cycles 2013 and 2014 with two cultivation periods each were investigated. In order to avoid a high number of classification runs, a pre-procedure was tested to get the multitemporal data set which provides best spectral separability. Therefore, Jeffries-Matusita (JM) measure was used in order to obtain the best multitemporal setting of all available images within one cultivation period. Eight classifiers were applied to compare the potential of separating crops. The three algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed by far the other classifiers with Overall Accuracies higher than 90 %. The processing time of ML and RF, however, was significantly shorter compared to SVM, in fact by a factor of five to seven.

AB Remote sensing plays a major role in crop classification, land use classification, and land cover classification such that the information for the classification is assured with the help of the satellite images. This paper concentrates on the land use classification and proposes an optimization algorithm, called Firefly Harmony Search (FHS) for training the Deep Belief Neural Network (DBN). The FHS algorithm is the integration of the Firefly Algorithm and Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA), which tunes the weights of DBN to perform the multi-class classification. For the effective classification, the multispectral image is subjected to the sparse Fuzzy C-Means to form segments such that the feature extraction is effective, free from dimensionality issues and computational complexities. The features extracted from the segments of the multi-spectral images include vegetation indices and statistical features. Then, these features are fed to the DBN, which is tuned using the FHS algorithm for performing the land use classification. Experimentation using four datasets proves the effectiveness of the proposed multi-class classification approach. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the method are found to be 0.9317, 0.9568, and 0.0379, respectively, that is effective over the existing land use classification methods.

AB This study comprehensively used Remote Sensing (RS) and GIS for independently monitoring crop water adequacy in response to existing irrigation management system in Bari Doab, Pakistan. Canals' rotation plan is developed before start of each cropping season to distribute water on fixed turn basis. The study combines the moderate (Landsat-8) and low resolution (MODIS) satellite imagery to assess near real time crop water deficit in canal command areas (CCAs) of the study area. Landsat imagery were used to develop crop classification and determine cropping pattern using time series of NDVI. MODIS' NDVI product was employed to monitor the current crop health and develop annual reference NDVI cycle based on last 13 years' imagery. Climatic data of WMO stations combined with DEM have also been used to determine reference evapotranspiration based on Penman-Monteith method. These inputs were combined to estimate average crop water deficit in CCAs for ongoing cropping season on 08-day interval, the interval parallel to the canal rotation plan. RS based reflectance crop coefficients (K-CR) of current and reference crop cycle were developed to calculate potential and actual evapotranspiration, and then translated their difference into crop water deficit. Lag time of 08-10 days is limitation of the study due to satellites overpass time, but it can still prove very helpful considering the crop season spanned over 160-180 days. Results revealed that maximum crop water deficit (up to 9 mm) occurred in CCAs during crop growing (mid) stage. Crop water deficit showed inverse relation when plotted against intense rainfall months. Crop water deficit results could be helpful for irrigation managers to modify canals' rotation plan in near real time according to crop health and growing stage. It would not only help in achieving equitable water distribution but also assuring supplies when required by the crops.

AB Remote sensing is an important technical means to investigate land resources. Optical imagery has been widely used in crop classification and can show changes in moisture and chlorophyll content in crop leaves, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is sensitive to changes in growth states and morphological structures. Crop-type mapping with a single type of imagery sometimes has unsatisfactory precision, so providing precise spatiotemporal information on crop type at a local scale for agricultural applications is difficult. To explore the abilities of combining optical and SAR images and to solve the problem of inaccurate spatial information for land parcels, a new method is proposed in this paper to improve crop-type identification accuracy. Multifeatures were derived from the full polarimetric SAR data (GaoFen-3) and a high-resolution optical image (GaoFen-2), and the farmland parcels used as the basic for object-oriented classification were obtained from the GaoFen-2 image using optimal scale segmentation. A novel feature subset selection method based on within-class aggregation and between-class scatter (WA-BS) is proposed to extract the optimal feature subset. Finally, crop-type mapping was produced by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results showed that the proposed method achieved good classification results with an overall accuracy of 89.50%, which is better than the crop classification results derived from SAR-based segmentation. Compared with the ReliefF, mRMR and LeastC feature selection algorithms, the WA-BS algorithm can effectively remove redundant features that are strongly correlated and obtain a high classification accuracy via the obtained optimal feature subset. This study shows that the accuracy of crop-type mapping in an area with multiple cropping patterns can be improved by the combination of optical and SAR remote sensing images.

AB Timely availability of crop acreage estimation is crucial for maintaining economic and ecological sustainability or modelling purposes. Remote sensing data has proven to be a reliable source for crop mapping and acreage estimation on parcel-level. However, when relying on a single source of remote sensing data, e.g. multispectral sensors like RapidEye or Landsat, several obstacles can hamper the desired outcome, for example cloud cover or haze. Another limitation may be a similarity in optical reflectance patterns of crops, especially in an early season approach by the end of March, early April. Usually, a reliable crop type map for winter-crops (winter wheat/rye, winter barley and rapeseed) in Central Europe can be obtained by using optical remote sensing data from late April to early May, given a full coverage of the study area and cloudless conditions. These prerequisites can often not be met. By integrating dual-polarimetric SAR-sensors with high temporal and spatial resolution, these limitations can be overcome. SAR-sensors are not influenced by clouds or haze and provide an additional source of information due to the signal-interaction with plant-architecture. The overall goal of this study is to investigate the contribution of Sentinel-1 SAR-data to regional crop type mapping for an early season map of disaggregated winter-crops for a subset of the Rur-Catchment in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). For this reason, RapidEye data and Sentinel-1 data are combined and the performance of Support Vector Machine and Maximum Likelihood classifiers are compared. Our results show that a combination of Sentinel-1 and RapidEye is a promising approach for most crops, but consideration of phenology for data selection can improve results. Thus the combination of optical and radar remote sensing data indicates advances for crop-type classification, especially when optical data availability is limited.

ID BAND SELECTION; TRANSFORM
AB Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), measuring the reflectance over visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR), has empowered the task of classification and can be useful in a variety of application areas like agriculture, even at a minor level. Band selection (BS) refers to the process of selecting the most relevant bands from a hyperspectral image, which is a necessary and important step for classification in HSI. Though numerous successful methods are available for selecting informative bands, reflectance properties are not taken into account, which is crucial for application-specific BS. The present paper aims at crop mapping for agriculture, where physical properties of light and biological conditions of plants are considered for BS. Initially, bands were partitioned according to their wavelength boundaries in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared regions. Then, bands were quantized and selected via metrics like entropy, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) from each region, respectively. A Convolutional Neural Network was designed with the finer generated sub-cube to map the selective crops. Experiments were conducted on two standard HSI datasets, Indian Pines and Salinas, to classify different types of crops from Corn, Soya, Fallow, and Romaine Lettuce classes. Quantitatively, overall accuracy between 95.97% and 99.35% was achieved for Corn and Soya classes from Indian Pines; between 94.53% and 100% was achieved for Fallow and Romaine Lettuce classes from Salinas. The effectiveness of the proposed band selection with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be seen from the resulted classification maps and ablation study.

DE remote sensing; time series; crop yield estimates
AB The search for low subjectivity area estimates has increased the use of remote sensing for agricultural monitoring and crop yield prediction, leading to more flexibility in data acquisition and lower costs comparing to traditional methods such as census and surveys. Low spatial resolution satellite images with higher frequency in image acquisition have shown to be adequate for cropland mapping and monitoring in large areas. The main goal of this study was to map the Summer crops in the State of Parana, Brazil, using 10-day composition of NDVI SPOT Vegetation data for 2005/2006, 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 cropping seasons. For this, a supervised digital classification method with Parallelepiped algorithm in multitemporal RGB image composites was used, in order to generate masks of Summer cultures for each 10-day composition. Accuracy assessment was performed using Kappa index, overall accuracy and Willmott's concordance index, resulting in good levels of accuracy. This methodology allowed the accomplishment, with free and low resolution data, of the mapping of Summer cultures at State level.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK CLASSIFICATION; MULTISOURCE
AB The objective of this research was to evaluate the synergistic effects of multitemporal European remote sensing satellite 1 (ERS-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data for crop classification using a per-field artificial neural network (ANN) approach. Eight crop types and conditions were identified: winter wheat, corn (good growth), corn (poor growth), soybeans (good growth), soybeans (poor growth), barley/oats, alfalfa, and pasture. With the per-field approach using a feed-forward ANN, the overall classification accuracy of three-date early- to mid-season SAR data improved almost 20%, and the best classification of a single-date (5 August) SAR image improved the overall accuracy by about 26%, in comparison to a per-pixel maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC). Both single-date and multitemporal SAR data demonstrated their abilities to discriminate certain crops in the early and mid-season; however, these overall classification accuracies (<60%) were not sufficiently high for operational crop inventory and analysis, as the single-parameter, high-incidence-angle ERS-1 SAR system does not provide sufficient differences for eight crop types and conditions. The synergy of TM3, TM4, and TM5 images acquired on 6 August and SAR data acquired on 5 August yielded the best per-field ANN classification of 96.8% (kappa coefficient = 0.96). It represents an 8.3% improvement over TM3, TM4, and TM5 classification alone and a 5% improvement over the per-pixel classification of TM and 5 August SAR data. These results clearly demonstrated that the synergy of TM and SAR data is superior to that of a single sensor and the ANN is more robust than MLC for per-field classification. The second-best classification accuracy of 95.9% was achieved using the combination of TM3, TM4, TM5, and 24 July SAR data. The combination of TM3, TM4, and TM5 images and three-date SAR data, however, only yielded an overall classification accuracy of 93.89% (kappa = 0.93), and the combination of TM3, TM4, TM5, and 15 June SAR data decreased the classification accuracy slightly (88.08%; kappa = 0.86) from that of TM alone. These results indicate that the synergy of satellite SAR and Landsat TM data can produce much better classification accuracy than that of Landsat TM alone only when careful consideration is given to the temporal compatibility of SAR and visible and infrared data.

AB Sustainability of world crop production and food security has become uncertain. The authors have developed an environmental research system called Remote Sensing Environmental Monitor (RSEM) for treating carbon sequestration by vegetation, grain production, desertification of Eurasian grassland, and CDM afforestation/reforestation to a background of climate change and economic growth in rising Asian nations. The RSEM system involves vegetation photosynthesis and crop yield models for grains, including land-use classification, stomatal evaluation by surface energy fluxes, and daily monitoring for early warning. This paper presents a validation method for RSEM based on carbon partitioning in plants, focusing in particular on the effects of area sizes used in crop production statistics on carbon fixation and on sterility-based corrections to accumulated carbon sequestration values simulated using the RSEM photosynthesis model. The carbonhydrate in grains has the same chemical formula as cellulose in grain plants. The method proposed by partitioning the fixed carbon in harvested grains was used to investigate estimates of the amounts of carbon fixed, using the satellite-based RSEM model.

AB The free access to satellite images since more than 40 years ago has provoked a rapid increase of multitemporal derived information of remote sensing data that should be summarized and analyzed for future inferences. In particular, the study of trends and trend changes is of crucial interest in many studies of phenology, climatology, agriculture, hydrology, geology or many other environmental disciplines. Overall, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as a satellite derived variable, plays a crucial role because of its usefulness for vegetation and landscape characterization, land use and land cover mapping, environmental monitoring, climate change or crop prediction models. Since the eighties, it can be retrieved all over the world from different satellites. In this work we propose to analyze its temporal evolution, looking for breakpoints or change-points in trends of the surfaces occupied by four NDVI classifications made in Spain from 1981 to 2015. The results show a decrease of bare soils and semi-bare soils starting in the middle nineties or before, and a slight increase of middle-vegetation and high-vegetation soils starting in 1990 and 2000 respectively.

AB Recent advances in electronic communication and information technology have led to the development of different remote sensing techniques in the field of precision agriculture. Retrieval of biochemical parameters using satellite data can prove to be a boon in terms of agricultural monitoring. Sentinel-2 data provide highly accurate spatial and temporal data, thus holds great potential for many agricultural related applications such as vegetation classification, identification of vegetation state, analysis of vegetation health, etc. But it is still a very challenging task for the researchers to identify different biochemical parameters of crop plants with the help of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, an attempt has been made to derive the relation between Sentinel-2 data and biochemical parameters of Sugarcane crop plants. For analyzing the relation between satellite data and biochemical parameters of crop plants, first we have calculated the reflectance values for band 2, band 3, band 4, and band 8 of Sentinel-2 images and then we have analyzed the biochemical parameters of sugarcane crop plants such as chlorophyll, carbohydrate, protein, hydrogen peroxide, phenol and proline using leaf samples. Finally, statistical analysis is done to find out the sensitivity of reflectance values for plant parameters. With the help of statistical analysis we have found out that reflectance values of band 2 (blue band) show sensitivity to phenol content in sugarcane crop plants and similarly reflectance value of band 8 (NIR band) show sensitivity for chlorophyll content.

AB Land use land cover (LU/LC) changes over the period are essential to understand the development of human activities within a region to define the impact of anthropogenic and natural activities. The virtual assessment of LU/LC changes between 2000 and 2016 is carried out in Pearl City (Thoothukudi) using Remote-Sensing data and GIS tool. This change detection is done by 15 m resolution cloud-free Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data captured during the year 2000 and 2016. The dynamic changes depict the major land use features like settlements, saltpan, crop land, vegetation, barren and water body from satellite data through supervised classifications of a maximum likelihood algorithm. The classified images highlight a series of constructive results in settlement (4.30%), vegetation (4.00%), saltpan (0.24%) and pessimistic results in barren land (-7.68%), crop land (-0.64%) and water body (-0.23%) respectively. The study recommends that urbanization of settlement land usage is highly mobilized in Thoothukudi coastal areas.

AB High accuracy classification results are very important for quantitative remote sensing research and the effect of remote sensing application. There are a variety of free global classification products available currently. However these products are mostly developed by foreign research institutions and personnel, and there is no adequate research on the complex terrain, vegetation structure differences and crop planting structure differences in China, which caused low classification accuracy in China, especially the classification accuracy of vegetation types. Therefor, it is necessary to develop a classification production of vegetation types in China. In this paper, we developed a classification method for vegetation types in China based on existing vegetation zoning. And we complete the 2012 national land cover classification using the method. The classification results are evaluated by the method of stratified random sampling, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are found to be greatly improved.

AB Agriculture applications rely on accurate land monitoring, especially paddy areas, for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field works or surveys performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and sparse. Agriculture monitoring systems are looking for sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing on satellite data for cheap and timely paddy mapping. The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous and intelligent system built on top of imagery data streams, which is available from low-Earth orbiting satellites, to differentiate crop areas from non-crop areas. However, such agriculture mapping framework poses unique challenges for satellite image processing, including the seasonal nature of crop, the complexity of spectral channels, and adversarial conditions such as cloud and solar radiance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-temporal high-spatial resolution classification method with an advanced spatiotemporal-spectral deep neural network to locate paddy fields at the pixel level for a whole year long and for each temporal instance. Our method is built and tested on the case study of Landsat 8 data due to its high spatial resolution. Empirical evaluations on real imagery datasets of different landscapes from 2016 to 2018 show the superior of our mapping model against the baselines with over 0.93 F1-score, the importance of each model design, the robustness against seasonal effects, and the visual mapping results.

ID RETRIEVAL; DECORRELATION
AB Light source independence and the advantage of being less affected by weather conditions than optical remote sensing, as well as the sensitivity to dielectric properties and targets structure, make Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly time-series data, a relevant tool for crop processes monitoring. This study aims to benefit from all the amplitude and phase SAR data to perform both a crop classification and a harvest date detection algorithm, supported by the first one for corn and soybean fields. Study area was located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. To achieve this goal, time-series of Interferometric Coherence (IC) and backscattering values in vertical transmit and vertical receive (sigma(0)(VV)), and vertical transmit and horizontal receive (sigma(0)(VH)) polarizations were generated from Single Look Complex images acquired from C-band SAR satellites Sentinel-1A and -1B. The crop classification was performed using a Random Forest classifier with an overall accuracy of 97%. For its training, both sigma(0)(VV) and sigma(0)(VH) time-series along the entire crops life cycle were used. Harvest detection algorithm was accomplished by analysing both the IC and sigma(0)(VH) time-series in an individual way for both crops. IC changes could be linked to plant structure characteristics along their life cycle (from seeding to harvesting), surface structure induced by harvest operations and post-harvest crops stubble. Based on the latter, individual criteria for corn and soybean were adopted. Crop depending on the determination of the harvest date detection was supported by the crop classification obtained. Harvest detection accuracy over 80 fields was superior to 93% for both crops. The proposed methodology for harvest detection is focused on the crops structural characteristics along its life cycle and the post-harvest stubble, which could lead to different IC behaviours.

AB In the global change context, an efficient management of the available resources has become one of the most important topics particularly for the sustainable crop development. Many questions concern the evolution of the rice farming systems in Camargue in Southeastern France, which play a crucial role in controlling the soil salinity. Their surface area significantly decreased from 20 000 ha in 2010 to 14 000 ha in 2014. The arrival of the new Sentinel satellites makes it possible to evaluate these crop evolutions. The objectives of this study were to propose operational methodologies to accurately assess the surface areas of the main crops, rice, wheat, and grassland, from classifications based on multispectral data; map agricultural practices (sowing and harvest residue burning); and elaborate a farm typology based on variables computed from remote sensing data to better understand the farming strategies. Dense time series of Sentinel images acquired at high spatial resolution (10 m) were analyzed for 2016 and 2017. A satisfactory accuracy was obtained for land use classification with 88% of correctly classified fields. The accuracy obtained for the estimation of the sowing date varied according to the studied year from 8 to 12 days, and burned areas were correctly identified (80%). The farm typology allowed to cluster farms at the territory level.

AB Using remote sensing, natural occurring vegetation data can be gathered and processed for planning purposes and environmental impact assessments. In contrast to agricultural crops, natural vegetation communities are present in the form of heterogeneous mosaics with fuzzy limits. This is observed in the Delta of Parana's river, a major fresh water wetland: located very close to Buenos Aires city, characterized by a hydrologic regime determined mainly by the lunar and wind tides of Dc La Plata River waters, and the Parana and Uruguay rivers regimes. Natural vegetation communities coexist with forest plantations, and recreational areas.
   This paper presents the procedures used for the study of this region using satellite remote sensing data (optical and radar). With respect to optical data, a conceptual classification scheme based on the flooding regime, the human intervention and the structural and flouristics characteristics of vegetation was developed. Next a sequential masking unsupervised classification procedure was applied to a multitemporal TM data set to be able to link "information classes" with "spectral classes" to obtain a land cover map. With respect to radar data, the conceptual classification scheme was slightly modified to underline the structural characteristics of vegetation. The overall objective was to establish the interaction mechanisms between the different landscape elements of the Delta and the SAR system as a function of sensor parameters and scene characteristics. Backscatter profiles for different angles of incidence and for different times were obtained, and discussed.

AB This paper describes the use of the National Agricultural Statistics Services remote sensing methodology to compare three multi-temporal scene-processing scenarios of the Mississippi Delta Region to produce the Mississippi Cropland Data Layer for 2004. The Mississippi Cropland Data Layer Program, initially started in 1999, uses medium resolution satellite imagery, random sample selection of fields, and field data to produce crop acreage estimates and a categorized data layer of the state showing the land use. The focus is on the major field crops and allows a visualization of the entire State of Mississippi land use by year when cloud-free imagery is available. The results for the three multi-temporal strategies show use of 2004 Landsat 5 scenes moderately early (5/6/04) and late (9/27/04) in the season give the superior classification for the Mississippi Delta and the 2004 Cropland Data Layer based on multi-temporal classification statistics and observation of the classified images. On the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce web site (http://www.mdac.state.ms.us/) you can currently see the changes in Mississippi farming per year from 1999 to 2003. In July 2005, the 2004 data will be added. The Cropland Data Layer results compare favorably with the official NASS Mississippi crop estimates for the major field crops in 1999-2004.

AB Forest density expressing the stocking states constitutes the major stand physiognomic parameter of Indian forest. Density and age are often taken as surrogate to structural and compositional changes that occur with the forest succession. Satellite remote sensing spectral response is reported to provide information on structure and composition of forest stands, The various vegetation indices are also correlated with forest canopy closure. The paper presents a three way crown density model utilizing the vegetation indices viz, advanced vegetation index, bare soil index and canopy shadow index for classification of forest crown density. The crop and water classes which could not be delineated by the model were finally masked from normalized difference vegetation index and TM band 7 respectively. The role based approach has been implemented for land use and forest density classification The broad land cover classification accuracy has been found to be 91.5%. In the higher forest density classes the classification accuracy ranged between 93 and 95%, whereas in the lower density classes it was found to be between 82 and 85%.

AB Mapping of peanut crops is essential in supporting peanut production, yield prediction, and commodity forecasting. While ground-based surveys can be used over small areas, the development of remote-sensing technologies could provide rapid and inexpensive crop area estimates with high accuracy over large regions. Some of these recent earth observation satellite systems, such as the Project for On-Board Autonomy Vegetation (PROBA-V), have the advantage of increased spatial and temporal resolution. With a study area located in the South Burnett region, Queensland, Australia, the primary aim of this study was to assess the ability of time-series PROBA-V 100-m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for peanut crop mapping. Two datasets, i.e., PROBA-V NDVI time-series imagery and the corresponding phenological parameters generated from TIMESAT data analysis technique, were classified using maximum likelihood classification, spectral angle mapper, and minimum distance classification algorithms. The results show that among all methods used, the application of MLC in PROBA-V NDVI time series produced very good overall accuracy, i.e., 92.75%, with producer and user accuracy of each class <= 78.79%. For all algorithms tested, the mapping of peanut cropping areas produced satisfactory classification results, i.e., 75.95% to 100%. Our study confirmed that the use of finer resolution 100 m of PROBA-V imagery (i.e., relative to MODIS 250-m data) has contributed to the success of mapping peanut and other crops in the study area.

AB Land use information is one of the most sought inputs for various resource and environmental management studies as well as climate models. In this study, an attempt was made to obtain land cover information from temporal data set of Advance Wide Field Sensor aboard Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-P6 using data mining classification technique. This study mainly focuses on the utility of visually interpreted thematic maps as an additional input for improving classification accuracies. The temporal data sets were co-registered to sub-pixel accuracy and were atmospherically corrected using modified dark pixel subtraction method. The visual thematic maps (wastelands and forest cover maps) were also co-registered to satellite data to a near pixel accuracy. Digital values were extracted for various classes and rule sets were generated using See-5 data mining software. These rule sets were ported into ERDAS Imagine Knowledge Engineer and the temporal data sets were classified. The results indicate that temporal satellite data at monthly intervals have a good potential to capture the land cover information including temporal dynamics of crop cover in agricultural lands. Addition of legacy maps obtained through monoscopic visual interpretation has helped to improve classification accuracies significantly. However, there exists a co-registration issue between visual maps as well as satellite data that have influenced the classification accuracies. The decision tree classification algorithm (See-5) used in this study is able to exploit the temporal variation in target spectral properties as well as thematic information from legacy maps satisfactorily. There has been a substantial improvement in various categories of forests as well as wastelands due to addition of visual maps. This has further reduced the misclassification of other vegetation categories, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy. Overall, kappa statistic of 0.885 was achieved with multitemporal satellite data, which was further improved to 0.932 with the addition of visual maps.

AB Remote sensing at optical wavelengths provides information on agricultural crop status, therefore being a useful tool for the detection and monitoring of drought stress in crop production. In the project "crop drought stress monitoring by remote sensing" (DROSMON) led by the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences in Vienna, which started in January 2005, remote sensing methods for drought stress classification were based on physical models of canopy reflectance using a combination of SAILH and PROSPECT.
   Spectral reflectance of wheat was measured in situ using a field spectroradiometer FieldSpec Pro FR for different crop development stages and drought stress levels at a test site in Vienna, Austria. An extensive validation program was carried out measuring various physiological properties of the crops. A significant difference in reflectance was observed between the canopies experiencing distinct drought stress levels. The observed differences could be confirmed by model simulations based on the measured biophysical variables. These suggest that there will be a change in spectral reflectance in drought stressed crops, varying according to the different growth stages. This is most marked in the near (NIR) and mid (MIR) infrared wavelength region, probably due to modifications of leaf internal structure, variations in leaf inclination (e.g. due to wilting) and leaf area index.
   We present initial results from this research, which partly support these ideas. Further investigations are necessary.

ID ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION
AB Processing to correct atmospheric effects and classify all constituent pixels in a remote sensing image is required before the image is used to monitor plant growth. The raw image contains artifacts due to atmospheric conditions at the time of acquisition. This study sought to distinguish the canopy growth of paddy rice using RapidEye (BlackBridge, Berlin, Germany) satellite data and investigate practical image correction and classification methods. The RapidEye images were taken over experimental fields of paddy rice at Chonnam National University (CNU), Gwangju, and at TaeAn, Choongcheongnam-do, Korea. The CNU RapidEye images were used to evaluate the atmospheric correction methods. Atmospheric correction of the RapidEye images was performed using three different methods, QUick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), and Atmospheric and Topographic Correction (ATCOR). To minimize errors in utilizing observed growth and yield estimation of paddy rice, the paddy fields were classified using a supervised classification method and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds, using the NDVI time-series features of the paddy fields. The results of the atmospheric correction using ATCOR on the satellite images were favorable, which correspond to those from reference UAV images. Meanwhile, the classification method using the NDVI threshold accurately classified the same pixels from each of the time-series images. We have demonstrated that the image correction and classification methods investigated here should be applicable to high resolution satellite images used in monitoring other crop growth conditions.

AB Classification accuracy statements derived from remote sensing are typically global measures. These provide a summary measure of the quality of the entire classification and are typically assumed to apply uniformly over the region represented. Classification accuracy may, however, vary across the region. A simple means of measuring and characterizing accuracy locally, which also facilitates the representation of the spatial variation in classification accuracy, is to constrain geographically the data used for accuracy assessment. The use of this approach is illustrated with a crop classification from Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre ( SPOT) High Resolution Visible (HRV) data. The global accuracy of the classification was estimated to be 84.0% but accuracy was found to vary locally from 53.33% to 100%. Moreover, accuracy varied from 0-100% over the region on a per-class basis. These variations in accuracy arose mainly as functions of the geographical distribution of the classes and highlight dangers in using a global measure of accuracy that masks spatial variation as a tool in classification evaluation. Local accuracy assessment can, therefore, be a useful analysis and, as the locational information is known, may be achieved at no substantial extra cost to the analysis.

DE Crop Loss; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Cyclone
AB Natural calamities triggered by erratic weather conditions like cyclone, earthquakes, hail storms, and Hood incurs substantial loss to the infrastructure and crops of the region. Countries across the globe are prone to such natural calamities. In India, specifically coastal parts are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In 2018 east coast districts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, India were affected by the three cyclones namely Titli (11 Oct. 2018), Gaja (16 Nov. 2018) and Pethai (17 Dec. 2018) causing severe damage to seasonal crops such as Rice, Coconut and Areca Nut plantations. Traditional survey-based methods of crop loss assessment are time-consuming and labor-intensive.
   This study addresses the problem of near-real-time qualitative crop loss assessment due to tropical Gaja cyclone using the temporal data from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites. The crop damage assessment study has been undertaken for Gaja cyclone in the affected district of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. The major crops cultivated in the district are Khalif Rice (locally called as Samba and Late Samba) and Coconut plantations. The study addresses qualitative loss assessment in terms of crop area affected. As a first step, we used time series data of Sentinel 1 (VV and VH backscatter) available between Aug.-Nov. 2018 to map the Kharif rice area. Also, cloud-free Sentinel 2 scenes available during Mar.-May. 2018 have been used to map the Coconut area. Field visits were conducted to collect the geo-tagged plot boundaries for the rice crop and coconut plantations. The data collected through field visits was used both for model training and crop loss assessment. Google maps satellite layer was used as a base map for identification of other non-crop classes (i.e., forest, water, settlement, etc.). The overall accuracy of crop area classification was 87.23% for rice and 92.22% for coconut.
   Further, to estimate the crop loss, crop layers along with the NDVI were considered. Two crop loss scenarios, namely minimum damage and maximum damage, were identified for both the crops. The mean NDVI composite before the event, i.e., 1-15 Nov. 2018 was considered as the base. In case of maximum loss scenario, short term NDVI composite available immediately after the event, i.e., 17-25 Nov. 2018 was selected. After the cyclone, long term NDVI composite of the mean (i.e., 17 Nov. 13 Dec. 2018) was used to assess the minimum loss scenario. Using field observations, the crop loss was categorized as severe loss, medium loss, low loss, and no loss. Results showed that the coconut plantations in Pattukkottai, Peravurani, and Papanasam blocks of Tanjavur are affected by the cyclone. The significant rice crop loss has been observed in Thanjavur, Orattanadu, Pattukkottai blocks. We have found the remote sensing based crop loss observations are matching with the government reports based on field observations. The remote sensing observations with human participatory sensing (i.e., field observations) has the potential tiff near-real-time crop loss assessment.

AB Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) program has always focused on food security needs and applications. IRS-1C was the fourth satellite on the IRS platform after many successful applications from IRS-1A, 1B, and P2 satellites. The LISS-I and LISS-II camera onboard IRS-1A/1B/P2 platform provided useful data for various natural resource management applications of country, including inventories of major crops (Wheat, Mustard, Rice, etc.), at the district level. Looking at specific requirements of assessment of multiple crops and associated small field sizes (< 1 ha) in which they are sown, it was felt that spatial and spectral resolution should be improved for assessing more crops and for improved crop discrimination. It was also decided to cater to the needs of village-level crop inventories as well as national-scale crop assessment. Hence, two new sensors, i.e., PAN (spatial resolution 5.8 m) and WiFS (spatial resolution 188 m) camera were introduced in the IRS-1C mission along with LISS-III (spatial resolution 23.5 m). Additionally, the LISS-III sensor, with the inclusion of the SWIR band, led to a significant improvement in crop classification and paved the way for monitoring both mono-cropped and multi-cropped regions. The availability of WIFS data with high temporal resolution (5 days) and large swath (810 km) gave newer applications like the national-level inventory of wheat crop. Pan-sharpened LISS-III data were found to be useful in cadastral level mapping. This paper reviews how the improvements in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions in IRS-1C helped in carrying out various agricultural applications including crop inventory at different scales, yield modeling, crop rotation mapping, cropping system analysis, drought assessment, irrigation management, and infrastructure planning.

AB Cropland mapping via remote sensing can provide crucial information for agri-ecological studies. Time series of remote sensing imagery is particularly useful for agricultural land classification. This study investigated the synergistic use of feature selection, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) segmentation and decision tree classification for cropland mapping using a finer temporal-resolution Landsat-MODIS Enhanced time series in 2007. The enhanced time series extracted 26 layers of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and five NDVI Time Series Indices (TSI) in a subset of agricultural land of Southwest Missouri. A feature selection procedure using the Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA) was performed, and 10 optimal features were selected as input data for OBIA segmentation, with an optimal scale parameter obtained by quantification assessment of topological and geometric object differences. Using the segmented metrics in a decision tree classifier, an overall classification accuracy of 90.87% was achieved. Our study highlights the advantage of OBIA segmentation and classification in reducing noise from in-field heterogeneity and spectral variation. The crop classification map produced at 30 m resolution provides spatial distributions of annual and perennial crops, which are valuable for agricultural monitoring and environmental assessment studies.

AB Accurately mapping crop area using coarse spatial resolution remote sensing imageries is challenging due to the existence of various spatial heterogeneities. The objective of this study is to analyze the accuracy of crop classification and area estimation affected by spatial heterogeneities, especially for sample impurity and landscape heterogeneity. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD09Q1 8-day composites and the derived phenology metrics were used to classify crop areas over Manitoba, Canada. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) approach was applied in the classification. The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Land Cover Dataset with 30 m spatial resolution was used as the base map to determine the study regions and training and validation samples. The results allowed to conclude that: (1) the classification accuracy of MODIS imagery is sensitive to both sample impurity and landscape heterogeneity. Purity limitations in samples can have a large impact on the classification accuracy. Regions with more homogenous pixels are more likely to be accurately classified and vice versa; (2) the crop area estimation error is less sensitive to sample impurity. It is not only determined by the purity of training samples but also by the actual purity condition of the crop type. The purest training sample group does not correspond well with the lowest error; (3) the impact of configurational heterogeneity on the area estimation is more significant than that of the compositional heterogeneity. Overall, both the sample impurity and landscape heterogeneities can largely affect the classification accuracy while only configurational heterogeneity has significant influence on crop area estimation.

AB Accurate and timely information on yield forecasting is necessary for policymakers in decision-making. The case study was planned to develop a framework for the regional wheat yield forecasting model for southeastern Turkey. Therefore, after implementing Top of Atmospheric (TOA) correction for all images and collecting ground-truthing point of 313 fields from the Nurdagi and Islahiye counties. A total of eight machine learning algorithms were tuned and tested for the satellite image classification so that best model was used for the spatial distribution of wheat crop. The results of machine learning algorithms showed an accuracy greater than 90%. As the best model, the random forest was used for image classification. The classification results showed that area estimated by the classifier were 11% more than those reported by the Turkish statistical department. The observed and predicted yield of the tested model was closed to each other with root mean square error (RMSE) of 198 kg ha(-1). The observed and predicted yield showed a close agreement with RMSE of 144 kg ha(-1)at Nurdagi and 68 kg ha(-1)at Islahiye for 5 years. It is concluded that remote sensing is useful tools for estimation of yield and developed can be used for other regions and crops.

AB Extracting cropland parcels from high-resolution remote sensing images is an important issue for dynamic land-use monitoring, precision agriculture and other fields. However, cropland spectra change frequently in time and spatial space. The application of multi-spectral image classification in cropland extraction, not only leads to misclassification with other vegetation easily, but also results in broken parcels caused by salt and pepper effect. Texture is an important feature of satellite images, which takes into account pixel gray scale difference and the spatial relationship between neighboring pixels. In order to overcome the impact of spectral variability, this paper presents an advanced cropland parcel extraction method based on texture analysis and multi-spectral image classification. Test on an ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) image shows that this method can effectively reduce the impact of spectral variations and obtain satisfactory results. But there still has some aspects which should be further improved in the future study, including: (1) some "noise" polygons still exist because the filter can not eliminate all the noise pixels completely; and (2) parcels generated by this approach can not reflect their subtle internal difference, such as inner boundary shaped by different crops.

AB Considering the problem in monitoring agricultural condition in the semi-arid areas of Northwest of China, we propose a new method for estimation of crop planting area, using the single phase optical and microwave remote sensing data collaboratively, which have demonstrated their respective advantages in the extraction of surface features. In the model, the ASAR backscatter coefficient is normalized by the incident angle at first, then the classifier based on Bayesian network is developed, and the VV, VH polarization of ASAR and all the 7 TM bands are taken as the input of the classifier to get the class labels of each pixel of the images. Moreover the crop planting areas can be extracted by the classification results. At last, the model is validated for the necessities of normalization by the incident angle and integration of TM and ASAR respectively. It results that the estimation accuracy of crop planting area of corn and other crops garden are 98.47% and 78.25% respectively using the proposed method, with an improvement of estimation accuracy of about 3.28% and 4.18% relative to single TM classification. These illustrate that synthesis of optical and microwave remote sensing data is efficient and potential in estimation crop planting area.

AB Heterogeneous crop identification has been the subject of much concern, since smallholder farms less than 1 ha are the main agricultural form in many areas, especially China. Remote sensing with high spectral and spatial resolutions via aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a potential alternative technique for the monitoring of heterogeneous crops in smallholder agriculture. Although this new type of remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions provides the possibility of fine classification, it also brings some challenges, such as bands contaminated with severe noise, the nonuniform distribution of the discriminative spectral information, and the spectral variability of crops. In this study, we attempted to resolve these problems by developing a robust spectral-spatial agricultural crop mapping method based on conditional random fields (SCRF), which learns the sensitive spectral information of the crops by a spectrally weighted kernel, and uses the spatial interaction of pixels to improve the classification performance. Data from a manned aircraft platform and a UAV platform were chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively use the relative utility of each spectral band to detect the bands contaminated with severe noise, and it uses the spectrally weighted kernel to consider the sensitive spectral information of the crops. The algorithm with only a spectrally weighted kernel showed an improvement of more than 4% over the classical support vector machine and random forest methods. Moreover, the spatial information was proved to be of crucial importance for crop classification, and both the object-oriented method and the proposed SCRF method can improve the classification performance in terms of both visualization and the quantitative metrics by considering the spatial information. Compared with the object-oriented method, SCRF can deliver a better classification performance, with an accuracy improvement of more than 2%.

AB Satellite imagery, in combination with remote sensing techniques, provides a new opportunity for monitoring and assessing crops with lower cost and greater objectivity than traditional surveys. The present research employed Landsat 5/TM satellite imagery to identify the land cover classes in Cafelandia (Parana, Brasil), a predominantly agricultural town. Five supervised classification methods (parallelepiped (PL), minimum distance (MND), Mahalanobis distance (MHD), maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and spectral angle mapper (SAM)) were tested in this work. To assess the efficiency of the classifications, accuracy indices and error metrics obtained through total confusion matrices were used. The results indicated that the Mahalanobis and SAM methods generated the smallest errors for the four studied land use classes (soybean, corn, forest, and bare soil), with overall accuracy values of 88% and 86%, respectively, and kappa index values 0.83 and 0.80, respectively. The values of these methods for the applied metrics were 0.88 and 0.86 for the sensitivity index, 0.96 and 0.95 for the total specificity index and 0.84 and 0.81 for Matthews correlation coefficient, respectively. The different classification methods clearly exhibited large variations in their performance for land cover mapping. The use of measures obtained from the error matrix is a suitable method for comparisons of thematic maps.

AB Considering the problem in monitoring agricultural condition in the semi-arid areas of Northwest of China, we propose a new method for estimation of crop planting area, using the single phase optical and microwave remote sensing data collaboratively, which have demonstrated their respective advantages in the extraction of surface features. In the model, the ASAR backscatter coefficient is normalized by the incident angle at first, then the classifier based on Bayesian network is developed, and the VV, VH polarization of ASAR and all the 7 TM bands are taken as the input of the classifier to get the class labels of each pixel of the images. Moreover the crop planting areas can be extracted by the classification results. At last, the model is validated for the necessities of normalization by the incident angle and integration of TM and ASAR respectively. It results that the estimation accuracy of crop planting area of corn and other crops garden are 98.47% and 78.25% respectively using the proposed method, with an improvement of estimation accuracy of about 3.28% and 4.18% relative to single TM classification. These illustrate that synthesis of optical and microwave remote sensing data is efficient and potential in estimation crop planting area.

AB Crop phonology monitoring is an important part of growth monitoring. On the other hand, the analysis on crop phenology can improve the accuracy of crop classification and crop yield estimation. Crop phenology mainly has relation not only to weather variety, but also to the regional planting habit. Crop phonological stages and growth period vary in different areas and different years. With the development of remote sensing technique, the detection of crop phenology and it s mechanism using remote sensing data on regional or global scales have become popular topics in remote sensing applications. The MERIS data can provide time-serial terrestrial parameters at a several-day frequency, with which we can track the growing process of crops (take winter wheat for example) and study its variation in the growing season. The normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) derived from red band and near infrared band of MERIS sensor is a directly remote sensing indicator that reflects crop growth situation. However, due to reasons such as the influence of cloud and atmospheric conditions, the residual noise in the time-series NDVI derived from MERIS will induce erroneous result in crop phenology monitoring. Thus in this study, after the time-series NDVI was computed from MERIS data, a Savitzky-Golay filter was used to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series at pixel scale, and a time-series NDVI dataset at day frequency was produced (reconstructed). Then indicators such as the peak were extracted from the crop NDVI profile for each pixel. After that the relation between these indicators and different phonological stages for winter wheat was analyzed and a model to estimate certain phonological stage for winter wheat was developed from the analysis. The model was validated with the field observation data collected from Fengqiu, Henan province and Yucheng, Shandong province. The validation result shows that the error in monitoring result for Heading Date and Flowering date of winter wheat is less than 3 days.

AB LiDAR data are becoming increasingly available, which has opened up many new applications. One such application is crop type mapping. Accurate crop type maps are critical for monitoring water use, estimating harvests and in precision agriculture. The traditional approach to obtaining maps of cultivated fields is by manually digitizing the fields from satellite or aerial imagery and then assigning crop type labels to each field - often informed by data collected during ground and aerial surveys. However, manual digitizing and labeling is time-consuming, expensive and subject to human error. Automated remote sensing methods is a cost-effective alternative, with machine learning gaining popularity for classifying crop types. This study evaluated the use of LiDAR data, Sentinel-2 imagery, aerial imagery and machine learning for differentiating five crop types in an intensively cultivated area. Different combinations of the three datasets were evaluated along with ten machine learning. The classification results were interpreted by comparing overall accuracies, kappa, standard deviation and f-score. It was found that LiDAR data successfully differentiated between different crop types, with XGBoost providing the highest overall accuracy of 87.8%. Furthermore, the crop type maps produced using the LiDAR data were in general agreement with those obtained by using Sentinel-2 data, with LiDAR obtaining a mean overall accuracy of 84.3% and Sentinel-2 a mean overall accuracy of 83.6%. However, the combination of all three datasets proved to be the most effective at differentiating between the crop types, with RF providing the highest overall accuracy of 94.4%. These findings provide a foundation for selecting the appropriate combination of remotely sensed data sources and machine learning algorithms for operational crop type mapping.

AB In this paper we discuss results of a pilot study conducted by Ukrainian Space Research Institute of NASU-NSAU, in collaboration with the MARS team of the JRC, to explore the feasibility, cost-efficiency and specific difficulties of crop area estimation assisted by satellite remote sensing in Ukraine. The study compares the cost efficiency of several image types (MODIS, Landsat TM, AWiFS, LISS-III and RapidEye) combined with a field survey on a stratified sample of square segments. Additionally, field data were collected "along the road" as training data for image classification algorithms. The study shows that TM images from Landsat 5 yielded the best results, in spite of the old age of this sensor. Among the sensors that were tested, only MODIS and Landsat TM reach cost-efficiency thresholds.

AB The accurate and timely access to the spatial distribution information of crops is of great importance for agricultural production management. Although widely used, supervised classification mapping requires a large number of field samples, and is consequently costly in terms of time and money. In order to reduce the need for sample size, this paper proposes an unsupervised classification method based on principal components isometric binning (PCIB). In particular, principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction is applied to the classification features, followed by the division of the top k principal components into equidistant bins. Bins of the same category are subsequently merged as a class label. Multitemporal Gaofen 1 satellite (GF-1) remote sensing images were collected over the southwest of Hulin City and Luobei County of Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, China in order to map crop types in 2016 and 2017. Our proposed method was compared with commonly used classifiers (random forest, K-means and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm (ISODATA)). Results demonstrate PCIB and random forest to have the highest classification accuracies, reaching 82% in 2016 in the southwest of Hulin City. In Luobei County in 2016, the accuracies of PCIB and random forest were determined as 81% and 82%, respectively. It can be concluded that the overall accuracy of our proposed method meets the basic requirements of classification accuracy. Despite exhibiting a lower accuracy than that of random forest, PCIB does not require a large field sample size, thus making it more suitable for large-scale crop mapping.

AB Spatial variability of crops within fields depend on soil variability. Understanding the magnitude and pattern in spatial variability of plant growth conditions detected by airborne remote sensing is important in order to provide modelers, regional planners and at least farmers with valuable information.
   Ground truth data of crop parameters were collected and related to spectral information in red, middle -and thermal infrared wavebands derived from airborne scanner data. Simple regression analysis have been used to obtain classification functions. The classified spectral images are finally compared with soil properties and N-balances for an extracted example. Results of two years under study indicate a high applicability of airborne remote sensing technique in order to detect spatial variability of plant growth conditions on field level.

AB Rice is the most important food grain crop in India and contributes to more than 40 percent of the country's food grain production. Spaceborne remote sensing offers economically viable and accurate production and area statistics. The utility of optical remote sensing in mapping rice cropped area is limited by persistent cloud cover during monsoon season. Temporal availability of SAR data has facilitated an operational procedure to monitor the rice crop. The current study discriminates rice crop, using single date hybrid polarimetric data available from RISAT-1 SAR. This was subjected to Raney m-delta, m-chi decompositions, and supervised classification was performed. The accuracy was estimated using the field points. The results were compared with rice map generated using optical sensor Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV and statistical data. The spatial agreement between the estimate from RISAT-1 and LISS-IV data was found to be 85 percent. The class kappa value was 0.94 and 0.92 for LISS-IV and RISAT-1, respectively.

AB Mapping and monitoring of the agricultural production systems on a regular interval provide important spatial matrix on the status, trend, and options for effective intervention at multiple scales. The recent advances in agrogeoinformatics big-data enriched with increasing open-access protocols become an integral part of solving the food security equation. This paper demonstrates use of an integrated earth observation system (EOS) for mapping and monitoring major agricultural production systems. The approach uses multitemporal and multi-scale remote sensing data coupled with insitu observation to map the legume and cereal production systems. The support vector machine (SVM) classification was found to be the best with overall classification accuracy of 82%. The in-situ data on crop grain and straw yields were measured using nested sampling approach. The best fit equation of yield values were regressed with remote sensing indices (NDVI and EVI). The significant correlation (R-2) value of cereal and lentil crop were 0.74 and 6.9 at p < 0.01 respectively. The R-2 value between observed yield and predicted yield was 0.80 and 0.97 in cereal and lentil crops respectively. The predicted yield based on remote sensing data varies from 3,303 to 5,710 kg ha(-1) and mean yield is 3,840 kg ha(-1). The productivity of the cereal crop was varies from 4228 kg ha(-1) to 4598 kg ha(-1) while lentil crop was between 304 to 1,500 kg ha(-1). The huge inter and intra field variably was observed through the study areas. Such information yielded vital information about yield gaps exists within and across the fields. Study is in progress to develop systematic and semi-automated algorithms to map and monitor the agricultural production on regular interval to quantify the changes in the cropping pattern, rotation, production and impacts of the technological interventions and ex-ante analysis.

AB Crop-type identification is very important in agricultural regions. Most researchers in this area have focused on exploring the ability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors to identify crops. This paper uses multi-source (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8) and multi-temporal data to identify crop types. The change detection method was used to analyze spectral and indices information in time series. Significant differences in crop growth status during the growing season were found. Then, three obviously differentiated time features were extracted. Three advanced machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, RF) were used to identify the crop types. The results showed that the detection of (Vertical-vertical) VV, (Vertical-horizontal) VH, and Cross Ratio (CR) changes was effective for identifying land cover. Moreover, the red-edge changes were obviously different according to crop growth periods. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 showed different normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes also. By using single remote sensing data to classify crops, Sentinel-2 produced the highest overall accuracy (0.91) and Kappa coefficient (0.89). The combination of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data provided the best overall accuracy (0.93) and Kappa coefficient (0.91). The RF method had the best performance in terms of identity classification. In addition, the indices feature dominated the classification results. The combination of phenological period information with multi-source remote sensing data can be used to explore a crop area and its status in the growing season. The results of crop classification can be used to analyze the density and distribution of crops. This study can also allow to determine crop growth status, improve crop yield estimation accuracy, and provide a basis for crop management.

AB Automatic classification of sensitive content in remote sensing images, such as drug crop sites, is a promising task, as it can aid law-enforcement institutions in fighting illegal drug dealers worldwide, while, at the same time, it can help monitor legalized crops in countries that regulate them. However, existing art on detecting drug crops from remote sensing images is limited in some key factors, not taking full advantage of the available hyperspectral information for analysis. In this paper, departing from these methods, we propose a data-driven ensemble method to detect drug sites from remote sensing images. Our method comprises different convolutional neural network architectures applied to distinct image representations, which are able to represent complementary characterizations of such crops. To validate the proposed approach, we considered in our experiments a dataset containing Cannabis Sativa crops, spotted by police operations in a Brazilian region called the Marijuana Polygon. The results in this dataset show that our ensemble approach outperforms other data-driven and feature-engineering methods in a real-world experimental setup, in which unbalanced samples are present and acquisitions from different places in the same region are used for training and testing the methods, highlighting the promising use of this solution to aid police operations in detecting and collecting evidence of such sensitive content properly.

AB Information on rice paddy practices and rice habitat is required by decision makers and monitoring protocol to manage the agricultural wetlands of the Sacramento Valley, California. Satellite remote sensing imagery have been able to support these needs with accurate maps of rice extent and delineation of winter flooding. However, delineation of rice and habitat, paddy hydroperiod, and spatiotemporal dynamics have not been thoroughly carried out in the region. The objective of this research application was to evaluate cost-efficient synthetic aperture radar and optical imagery for mapping agricultural wetlands and hydroperiod management. Ground-truth field data from the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District was used to test a suite of remote sensing indices to differentiate among agricultural wetland types and irrigation practices. A Classification And Regression Tree approach that utilized the random forest algorithm was built to map the agricultural wetlands of the Sacramento Valley. Results show optical indices sensitive to vegetative development and surface water (Landsat NDVI and LSWI) along with Synthetic Aperture Radar backscatter values (PALSAR HH sigma nought sigma A degrees dB) were the most useful for mapping hydroperiod across habitats. Overpass timing and irrigation management were key factors in sensor and index selection. Nearly 93 % (185,494 ha) of rice paddies in the Valley underwent wet seeding practices and half (90,168 ha) of actively cultivated rice area was flooded during the winter. Eight percent (16,420 ha) of rice habitat received at least one irrigation application during the crop season. The most challenging habitat types to separate were fallow rice paddies that underwent different frequencies of inundation management due to permitting policies and duck habitat promotion. Overall, the results emphasize the utility of satellite remote sensing for rice decision making and as cost-effective tools for supporting Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification protocol.

ID IMAGES; MODEL
AB With the large number of high-resolution images now being acquired, high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery scene classification has drawn great attention but is still a challenging task due to the complex arrangements of the ground objects in HSR imagery, which leads to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantic concepts. As a feature representation method for automatically learning essential features from image data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been introduced for HSR remote sensing image scene classification due to their excellent performance in natural image classification. However, some scene classes of remote sensing images are object-centered, i.e., the scene class of an image is decided by the objects it contains. Although previous methods based on CNNs have achieved comparatively high classification accuracies compared with the traditional methods with handcrafted features, they do not consider the scale variation of the objects in the scenes. This makes it difficult to directly utilize CNNs on those remote sensing images belonging to object-centered classes to extract features that are robust to scale variation, leading to wrongly classified scene images. To solve this problem, scene classification based on a deep random-scale stretched convolutional neural network (SRSCNN) for HSR remote sensing imagery is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, patches with a random scale are cropped from the image and stretched to the specified scale as the input to train the CNN. This forces the CNN to extract features that are robust to the scale variation. Furthermore, to further improve the performance of the CNN, a robust scene classification strategy is adopted, i.e., multi-perspective fusion. The experimental results obtained using three datasets-the UC Merced dataset, the Google dataset of SIRI-WHU, and the Wuhan IKONOS dataset-confirm that the proposed method performs better than the traditional scene classification methods.

AB Due to human population growth and global climate change, crop monitoring is becoming more significant every day. Remote sensing is a very practical method for crop monitoring. In this study, we classified agricultural crops in multi-temporal single-pol TerraSAR-X images. With the extraction of morphological profiles, spatial information is fused with SAR backscattering. K-NN algorithm is applied and overall classification accuracy in multi-temporal images reached 90% for 18 classes with the contribution of morphological profiles.

AB Geographic mapping of coffee crops by using remote sensing images and supervised classification has been a challenging research subject. Besides the intrinsic problems caused by the nature of multi-spectral information, coffee crops are non-seasonal and usually planted in mountains, which requires encoding and learning a huge diversity of patterns during the classifier training. In this paper, we propose a new approach for automatic mapping coffee crops by combining two recent trends on pattern recognition for remote sensing applications: deep learning and fusion/selection of features from multiple scales. The proposed approach is a pixel-wise strategy that consists in the training and combination of convolutional neural networks designed to receive as input different context windows around labeled pixels. Final maps are created by combining the output of those networks for a non-labeled set of pixels. Experimental results show that multiple scales produces better coffee crop maps than using single scales. Experiments also show the proposed approach is effective in comparison with baselines.

AB Mango (Mangifera indica) is the most important commercially grown fruit crop in India. Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are the major producers of mango. It covers around 42% total area accounting for 40% of total production in the country. Hence, development of reliable and timely estimates of area under mango at national level is essential for policymakers and planners for market planning and export. Earlier only survey technologies were used for area estimation which was a time consuming and laborious process. Modern space technology like remote sensing can be used as an alternative. Therefore, a study was carried out for acreage estimation of mango in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh using Sentinel 2 satellite data in the year 2017. Acreage estimation of mango was done after the preparation of land use and land cover map. Three supervised classification techniques, viz. Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used for land use and land cover map preparation. Support Vector Machine using three different kernel functions, viz. Radial Basis Function (RBF), Sigmoid kernel and Polynomial kernel were used to improve the classification accuracy. SVMRBF was found to be the best classification technique with overall accuracy of 94.44 and kappa coefficient 0.9218. The mango area obtained from the classified satellite image using SVMRBF was 9372.96 ha.

AB Weed control is commonly performed by applying selective herbicides homogeneously over entire agricultural fields. However, applying herbicide only where needed could have economical and environmental benefits. The objective of this study was to apply remote sensing to the detection of grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal and broadleaf crops. Spectral relative reflectance values at both leaf and canopy scales were obtained by field spectroscopy for four plant categories: wheat, chickpea, grass weeds, and broadleaf weeds. Total reflectance spectra of leaf tissues for botanical genera were successfully classified by general discriminant analysis (GDA). The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 +/- 4.19% for wheat and 94 +/- 5.13% for chickpea. The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for future Vegetation and Environmental Monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENS) bands was 77 +/- 8.09% for wheat and 88 +/- 6.94% for chickpea, and for the operative satellite Advanced Land Imager (ALI) bands was 78 +/- 7.97% for wheat and 82 +/- 8.22% for chickpea. Within the critical period for weed control, an overall classification accuracy of 87 +/- 5.57% was achieved for >5% vegetation coverage in a wheat field, thereby providing potential for implementation of herbicide applications. Qualitative models based on wheat, chickpea, grass weed, and broadleaf weed spectral properties have high-quality classification and prediction potential that can be used for site-specific weed management.

AB Novel approaches and algorithms to estimate crop physiological processes from Earth Observation (EO) data are essential to develop more sustainable management practices in agricultural systems. Within this context, this paper presents the results of different research activities carried out within the ESA-MOST Dragon 4 programme. The paper encompasses two research avenues: (a) the retrieval of biophysical variables of crops and yield prediction; and (b) food security related to different crop management strategies. Concerning the retrieval of variables, results show that LAI, derived by radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion, when assimilated into a crop growth model (i.e., SAFY) provides a way to assess yields with a higher accuracy with respect to open loop model runs: 1.14 t center dot ha(-1) vs 4.42 t center dot ha(-1) RMSE for assimilation and open loop, respectively. Concerning food security, results show that different pathogens could be detected by remote sensing satellite data. A k coefficient higher than 0.84 was achieved for yellow rust, thus assuring a monitoring accuracy, and for the diseased samples k was higher than 0.87. Concerning permanent crops, neural network (NN) algorithms allow classification of the Pseudomonas syringae pathogen on kiwi orchards with an overall accuracy higher than 91%.

AB The availability of an unprecedented amount of open remote sensing data, such as Sentinel-1 and -2 data within the Copernicus program, has boosted the idea of combining the use of optical and radar data to improve the accuracy of agricultural applications such as crop classification. Sentinel-1's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides co- and cross-polarized backscatter, which offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural crops using radar at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we assessed the potential of integrating Sentinel-1 information (VV and VH backscatter and their ratio VH/VV with Sentinel-2A data (NDVI) to perform crop classification and to define which are the most important input data that provide the most accurate classification results. Further, we examined the temporal dynamics of remote sensing data for cereal, horticultural, and industrial crops, perennials, deciduous trees, and legumes. To select the best SAR input feature, we tried two approaches, one based on classification with only SAR features and one based on integrating SAR with optical data. In total, nine scenarios were tested. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 22 nonparametric classifiers on which most of these algorithms had not been tested before with SAR data. The results revealed that the best performing scenario was the one integrating VH and VV with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and cubic support vector machine (SVM) (the kernel function of the classifier is cubic) as the classifier with the highest accuracy among all those tested.

AB The classification of crops from remote sensing has become an important part of agricultural management, and as a result, has instigated a great deal of research aimed at increasing classification accuracy through various methods and techniques. However, comparatively little research has been performed on determining the best time(s) of image acquisition for crop discrimination even though this could impact classification accuracy as much as choice of clustering algorithm or selection of training data, for example. This case study was conducted to: (1) determine temporal windows for highest overall and individual crop discrimination; and (2) compare simple methods for combining best single-date results to increase overall accuracy. Seventeen single-date classifications of four major summer crops (rice, maize, sorghum, and soybeans) were assessed for a single growing season at the Coleambally Irrigation Area, Australia using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper data. Per-pixel classifications were generated using a maximum likelihood classifier and were then combined with field boundaries to produce per-field classifications, based on the majority crop type within each field. Multi-date classifications were performed by: (1) combining various numbers of bands per date into a single image stack prior to classification (2-date, and 3-date-termed standard multi-date classification); as well as (2) extracting maximum accuracy single-crop classes from different dates and combining them, post-classification (termed iterative multi-date classification). Results showed that the general time-frame for highest overall single-date classification accuracy was late February to mid March. For the individual crops, late November to early December resulted in the highest accuracy for discriminating rice, maize was best discriminated from mid-February to mid-March, the maximum sorghum separability occurred from early April till at least early May, and the soybean temporal window extended from early January to mid-March, with late-February to early March being best. The iterative approach resulted in higher accuracy than the standard multi-date image stack of the same dates. Highest multi-date accuracy resulted from the 3-date per-field iterative classification (overall classification accuracy of 95.8%), an improvement of more than 6% over best per-field single-date results (10 March, 89.4%). Determination of temporal windows for crop discrimination and use of an iterative technique to combine multiple-date images both greatly improved overall crop classification, thus increasing the benefit of remote sensing in operational management.

AB Annual crop inventory information is important for many agriculture applications and government statistics. The synergistic use of multi-temporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and available multispectral remote sensing data can reduce the temporal gaps and provide the spectral and polarimetric information of the crops, which is effective for crop classification in areas with frequent cloud interference. The main objectives of this study are to develop a deep learning model to map agricultural areas using multi-temporal full polarimetric SAR and multi-spectral remote sensing data, and to evaluate the influence of different input features on the performance of deep learning methods in crop classification. In this study, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) was proposed and tested on multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 and VEN mu S data for crop classification. Compared with the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and non-deep learning methods including XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machina (SVM), the Conv1D performed the best when the multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data (Pauli decomposition or coherency matrix) and VEN mu S multispectral data were fused by the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation. The Pauli decomposition and coherency matrix gave similar overall accuracy (OA) for Conv1D when fused with the VEN mu S data by the MNF transformation (OA = 96.65 +/- 1.03% and 96.72 +/- 0.77%). The MNF transformation improved the OA and F-score for most classes when Conv1D was used. The results reveal that the coherency matrix has a great potential in crop classification and the MNF transformation of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 and VEN mu S data can enhance the performance of Conv1D.

AB High resolution remote sensing image contains abundant information, but remote sensing classification only based on spectral information is affected in the complex spectrum area. Crop area and other land-cover objects contain different texture features. This paper extracts texture information based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix and Gabor filters group, sets up spectrum-texture joint feature set. To enhance classification efficiency, Ensemble learning strategy is introduced to improve classical support vector machine and back propagation neural network classifiers in training process. To prove the effectiveness of proposed methods, several experiment images are utilized to execute experiments. Results indicate that proposed methods improve classification accuracy compared with classical algorithms significantly, and promote running efficiency compared with the situation of large sample, support corn area statistical process and yield estimation.

AB Crop identification and acreage estimation with remote sensing were the main issues for crop production estimation. Object-oriented classification has been involved in crop extraction from high spatial resolution images. However, different imagery segmentation scales for object-oriented classification always yield quite different crop identification accuracy. In this paper, multi-scale image segmentation was conducted to carry out crop identification using HJ CCD imagery in Red Star Farm in Heilongjiang province. Corn, soybean and wheat were identified as the final crop classes. Crop identification features at different segmentation scale were generated. Crop separability based on different feature-combinations was evaluated using class separation distance. Nearest Neighbour classifier (NN) was then used for crop identification. The results showed that the best segmentation scale was 8, and the overall crop identification accuracy was about 0.969 at that scale.

AB During the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technologies are widely used to improve agriculture productivity while reducing drudgery, inspection time, and crop management cost. Moreover, they are able to cover large areas in a matter of a few minutes. Due to the impressive technological advancement, UAV-based remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to collect valuable data that could be used to achieve many precision agriculture applications, including crop/plant classification. In order to process these data accurately, we need powerful tools and algorithms such as Deep Learning approaches. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has emerged as a powerful tool for image processing tasks achieving remarkable results making it the state-of-the-art technique for vision applications. In the present study, we reviewed the recent CNN-based methods applied to the UAV-based remote sensing image analysis for crop/plant classification to help researchers and farmers to decide what algorithms they should use accordingly to their studied crops and the used hardware. Fusing different UAV-based data and deep learning approaches have emerged as a powerful tool to classify different crop types accurately. The readers of the present review could acquire the most challenging issues facing researchers to classify different crop types from UAV imagery and their potential solutions to improve the performance of deep learning-based algorithms.

AB Accurate mapping of crop distribution on Earth's surface aids in predicting grain production. Pattern classification along with remote sensing imagery can facilitate traditional manual field measurement techniques using machine learning. With the rapid increase in satellite sensor resolution, the object-based classification paradigm has increasingly been applied. However, scale parameter selection is always a difficult part of the object-based classification. Based on ensemble learning, this study proposes a classification method using the multiscale object-based weighted method which includes manual digitizing of crop distribution in the southern region of Jishan County, Shanxi Province, China, applying Gaofen-2 (GF-2) images. This method initially uses estimations of the scale parameter (ESP) tool to select "good" scales, defined here as "preferred" scales, after which feature subsets are screened by each preferred scale as the input of multiple classifiers and classifies. Finally, all classification results are then fused. Our research results indicate that: 1) Feature importance values are sorted differently at different preferred scales; 2) accuracy differences become clear when different preferred scales are combined with different classifiers, and determining the "best" single appropriate scale is generally difficult; 3) accuracy of the multiscale weighted classification method is higher compared to the single preferred scale approach. Furthermore, ensemble learning can be achieved using this method on multiple scales and on multiple classifiers. With this method, procedures that necessitate the selection of segmentation scales and the selection and optimization of classifiers can be skipped altogether.

AB As a powerful image processing technology, deep learning can extract representative and distinguishing features from remote sensing images in a hierarchical way. Considering the spectral information as the network input, the output spectral features from the network can be directly fed into a subsequent classifier to realize the classification based on pixel level. This paper presents a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for peanut planting area extracting from Landsat-8 multispectral remote sensing images and applied in Zhenyang county in Henan province. The experimental results show that the architecture of CNN achieve good performance, the overall accuracy is 96.42%, kappa efficient is 0.944. Statistical calculations show that the peanut planting area of Zhengyang county increased by 12.1% in 2017 compared with 2015 which consistent with the current agricultural subsidy policy. The exploration of using CNN for crop recognition from multispectral images has excellent performance and great potential in agricultural remote sensing classification.

AB Efficient methodologies for mapping croplands are an essential condition for the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices and for monitoring crops periodically. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classifications of various crop types in three different study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classification outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05% and 96.19%; it also proved to be more efficient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classification results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classified crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited.

AB Currently, monitoring of agrarian policy actions usually requires ground visits to sample targeted farms, a time-consuming and very expensive procedure. To improve this, we have undertaken a study of the accuracy of five supervised classification methods (Parallelepiped, Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis Classifier Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper and Maximum Likelihood) using multispectral and pan-sharpened QuickBird imagery. We sought to verify whether remote sensing offers the ability to efficiently identify crops and agro-environmental measures in a typical agricultural Mediterranean area characterized by dry conditions. A segmentation of the satellite data was also used to evaluate pixel, object and pixel + object as minimum information units for classification. The results indicated that object- and pixel + object-based analyses clearly outperformed pixel-based analyses, yielding overall accuracies higher than 85% in most of the classifications and exhibiting the Maximum Likelihood of being the most accurate classifier. The accuracy for pan-sharpened image and object-based analysis indicated a 4% improvement in performance relative to multispectral data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Irrigation water requirements of wheat and mustard crops grown in Western Yamuna Canal Command area were estimated using FAO model CROPWAT with the help of agrometeorological and remote sensing data (1986-1998 and 2008). The variations in irrigation water requirements of these two crops were judged by calculating coefficient of Variations (CVs) of yearly data. Crop coefficient values were obtained through FAO (1993) method. Supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification (MXL) of IRS 1B image was done to estimate area under wheat and mustard in the canal command. Water need was calculated from amount of supply and water requirement for the whole area. Results showed that ET(crop) values of both wheat and mustard varied very little over different years (CVs 4.7% and 5.6% respectively). Irrigation water requirements of both these crops were having relatively large variations (CVs 14.1% and 22.6% respectively) which were mainly because of high variations of their effective rainfall (CVs 61.1% and 69.2% respectively). In general, increase in amount of irrigation enhanced the growth performance of the wheat crop. Increase in distribution equity within soil associations slightly improved the growth performance of the wheat crop. Agro-climatic data merged with satellite image approximated the deficiency of applied irrigation amount (549.5 ha-m for wheat and 692.7 ha-m for mustard) as compared to requirement.

AB Introduction: Ethiopia has made efforts to tackle the challenges of low crop and livestock productivity and degradation of land resources through various rural development strategies. However, increasing demands for food, animal feed, fuel, and income-generating activities are putting pressure on the land. In this paper, we describe the production pressure and competition between crop and livestock production, quantify rates of land-use/cover (LULC) changes, and examine driving forces and consequences of land conversion.
   Methods: The study was conducted in Gudo Beret watershed, North Shewa Zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia. It used a combination of methods including remote sensing, household interviews, field observations, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Supervised and unsupervised image classification methods were employed to map LULC classes for 31 years (1984-2016).
   Results: The results of satellite remote sensing revealed that 51% of the land in the study area was subject to accelerated land conversions. The household survey results indicated that feed resources and grain production pressures were 1.43 and 1.34 t ha(-1) respectively. The observed annual changes in plantation and settlement areas were 2.6% and 2.9%. This was mainly at the expense of bushland and grazing land systems. Cropland increased (0.4% year(-1)) while grazing land reduced (3.5% year(-1)) under contrasting dynamics and competitive changes. An increase in human and livestock populations and farm expansion were major drivers of land conversion that adversely affected household livelihoods and the natural ecosystem. The consequences of these pressures resulted in a lack of animal feed, low crop-livestock productivity, and a reduction in natural vegetation coverage.
   Conclusions: We suggest that sustainable land resource management, more integrated crop-livestock production, and the use of productivity-enhancing technologies could play a role in managing competition for land resources.

AB This study assessed land cover (LC) changes in Kahramanmara angstrom (K.Mara angstrom) and its environs by using multitemporal Landsat and ASTER imagery, respectively belong to 1989, 2000 and 2004. A priori defined nine land cover classes in the classification scheme were urban and built-up, forest, sparsely vegetated areas, grassland, vegetated stream beds, unvegetated stream beds, bare areas, crop fields, and water bodies. Individual classifications were employed using the combination of both unsupervised and supervised classification methods. Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) was used to reduce spectral variation in the scenes arising from complex pattern of crop fields. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used in the LC classification of the individual images. Image pairs of consecutive dates were compared by overlaying the thematic LC maps and cross-tabulating the LC statistics. Urbanization and expansion of agriculture were the major reasons for the dramatic LC conversions. The amount of conversion from crop fields to water occurred as large as 927.67 ha, accounting for 73% of the total land-to-water conversion. Conversions to agriculture have mainly been occurred from grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas as large as 1,314.95 and 1,325.84 ha, respectively. Urban coverage doubled in this period as a result of 1,443.45 ha of increase. Urban area increased in the second period from 2,920 to 3,526 ha. Conversions to agriculture occurred at high amounts. A total of 1,075.79 ha area changed from sparsely vegetated areas to crop fields. A landscape-level environmental monitoring scheme based on satellite remote sensing was proposed for effective environmental resource management.

AB Mapping agricultural crops is an important application of remote sensing. However, in many cases it is based either on hyperspectral imagery or on multitemporal coverage, both of which are difficult to scale up to large-scale deployment at high spatial resolution. In the present paper, we evaluate the possibility of crop classification based on single images from very high-resolution (VHR) satellite sensors. The main objective of this work is to expose performance difference between state-of-the-art parcel-based smoothing and purely data-driven conditional random field (CRF) smoothing, which is yet unknown. To fulfill this objective, we perform extensive tests with four different classification methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gaussian Mixtures, and Maximum Likelihood) to compute the pixel-wise data term; and we also test two different definitions of the pairwise smoothness term. We have performed a detailed evaluation on different multispectral VHR images (Ikonos, QuickBird, Kompsat-2). The main finding of this study is that pairwise CRF smoothing comes close to the state-of-the-art parcel-based method that requires parcel boundaries (average difference approximate to 2.5%). Our results indicate that a single multispectral (R, G, B, NIR) image is enough to reach satisfactory classification accuracy for six crop classes (corn, pasture, rice, sugar beet, wheat, and tomato) in Mediterranean climate. Overall, it appears that crop mapping using only one-shot VHR imagery taken at the right time may be a viable alternative, especially since high-resolution multitemporal or hyperspectral coverage as well as parcel boundaries are in practice often not available.

AB Accurate and timely access to the production area of crop seeds allows the seed market and secure seed supply to be monitored. Seed maize and common maize production fields typically share similar phenological development profiles with differences in the planting patterns, which makes it challenging to separate these fields from decametric-resolution satellite images. In this research, we proposed a method to identify seed maize production fields as early as possible in the growing season using a time series of remote sensing images in the Liangzhou district of Gansu province, China. We collected Sentinel-2 and GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images captured from March to September. The feature space for classification consists of four original bands, namely red, green, blue, and near-infrared (nir), and eight vegetation indexes. We analyzed the timeliness of seed maize identification using Sentinel-2 time series of different time spans and identified the earliest time frame for reasonable classification accuracy. Then, the earliest time series that met the requirements of regulatory accuracy were compared and analyzed. Four machine/deep learning algorithms were tested, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector classification (SVC), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The results showed that using Sentinel-2 images from March to June, the RF and LSTM algorithms achieve over 88% accuracy, with the LSTM performing the best (90%). In contrast, the accuracy of KNN and SVC was between 82% and 86%. At the end of June, seed maize mapping can be carried out in the experimental area, and the precision can meet the basic requirements of monitoring for the seed industry. The classification using GF-1 images were less accurate and reliable; the accuracy was 85% using images from March to June. To achieve near real-time identification of seed maize fields early in the growing season, we adopted an automated sample generation approach for the current season using only historical samples based on clustering analysis. The classification accuracy using new samples extracted from historical mapping reached 74% by the end of the season (September) and 63% by the end of July. This research provides important insights into the classification of crop fields cultivated with the same crop but different planting patterns using remote sensing images. The approach proposed by this study enables near-real time identification of seed maize production fields within the growing season, which could effectively support large-scale monitoring of the seed supply industry.

AB Remote sensing image is becoming an increasingly popular tool for crop lodging detection because it conveniently provides features for building machine learning models and predicting lodging. However, difficulties in interpreting machine learning models and their predictions limit the confidence of using remote sensing images to detect lodging. In addition, the lodging datasets used for modeling are difficult to balance under natural conditions. Designing a robust and interpretable classification model for the detection of lodging in an imbalanced distribution dataset poses a particularly difficult challenge. In this study, visible and multi-spectral images were collected with a UAV to extract relevant features from remote sensing images.In a preliminary step, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) method were used to treat imbalanced datasets. The SMOTE-ENN-XGBoost model is proposed for the efficient identification of maize lodging at the plot scale. The SMOTE-ENN-XGBoost model achieved an F1-score of 0.930 and a recall of 0.899 on a testing set, suggesting that it can be used for modeling lodging detection. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was employed to interpret the identification and prioritization of features that determine lodging classification and activity prediction. The results showed that canopy structure and textural features are relatively stable compared with spectral features, which are susceptible to the external environment when modeling is employed to detect lodging. This work also showed that canopy structural, spectral, and textural information should be considered simultaneously rather than separately when detecting crop lodging in a crop breeding program in order to prevent differences in expression controlled by the interaction between genotype and environment obscuring the change in a single feature before and after lodging. For practical applications of machine learning models in crop lodging detection, such insights are of critical relevance. Taken together, the results of this study encourage further applications of remote sensing techniques to build interpretable machine learning models.

AB In this article, we proposed an effective adaptive 2-dimension blind watermarking algorithm based on feature of a remote sensing image. This algorithm exploited a gray image as the watermark, pretreated the watermark image by Arnold confusion and wavelet compression, and embedded it into the selected subband of wavelet transformation domain of the remote sensing image according to neighboring symbol's mean value and odd-even adjugement rule, moreover, detected watermarks without the original remote sensing image. The attack analysis and experimental results show that the watermarking algorithm is transparent and robust, with accurate watermark detecting results and low complexity, and it also has strong robustness against various image attacks such as JPEG lossy compression, median filtering, additive noise, scaling, cropping, rotation, random geometrical attack and Stirmark attack. Furthermore, after embedding watermarks, there is almost no influence on such applications of the remote sensing image as edge detection and image classification.

AB An efficient management of our precious water resources is not possible without acquiring a comprehensive and detailed understanding on water fluxes at irrigated areas. In the past few decades, agricultural water balance analyses have been carried out at a wide variety of temporal (from hourly to annual) and spatial (from plant root zone to basin) scales. Scheme-wide water balance analyses, in particular, provide information on the amount of water supplied to irrigation schemes and its fate. This paper attempts to summarise the results of previous studies in quantifying water balance components of irrigation schemes, as well as to present challenges and opportunities of conducting such research projects. With recent improvements in air- and space-borne imaging of land surfaces, remote sensing techniques nowadays can serve as a powerful tool in monitoring/modeling water movements, at or near real time. Remote sensing contribution to water balance studies could be as simple as developing crop classification maps, or as complicated as estimating the spatially distributed evapotranspiration, which is perhaps the most critical water flux in irrigated areas. Therefore, this paper also aims to review the few studies that have incorporated satellite-derived products in their water budget analysis. Finally, the results of a case study from the southern California are presented to better demonstrate the potential of remotely sensed data. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Monitoring crops and weeds is a major challenge in agriculture and food production today. Weeds compete directly with crops for moisture, nutrients, and sunlight. They therefore have a significant negative impact on crop yield if not sufficiently controlled. Weed detection and mapping is an essential step in weed control. Many existing research studies recognize the importance of remote sensing systems and machine learning algorithms in weed management. Deep learning approaches have shown good performance in many agriculture-related remote sensing tasks, such as plant classification, disease detection, etc. However, despite the success of these approaches, they still face many challenges such as high computation cost, the need of large labelled datasets, intra-class discrimination (in growing phase weeds and crops share many attributes similarity as color, texture, and shape), etc. This paper aims to show that the attention-based deep network is a promising approach to address the forementioned problems, in the context of weeds and crops recognition with drone system. The specific objective of this study was to investigate visual transformers (ViT) and apply them to plant classification in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) images. Data were collected using a high-resolution camera mounted on a UAV, which was deployed in beet, parsley and spinach fields. The acquired data were augmented to build larger dataset, since ViT requires large sample sets for better performance, we also adopted the transfer learning strategy. Experiments were set out to assess the effect of training and validation dataset size, as well as the effect of increasing the test set while reducing the training set. The results show that with a small labeled training dataset, the ViT models outperform state-of-the-art models such as EfficientNet and ResNet. The results of this study are promising and show the potential of ViT to be applied to a wide range of remote sensing image analysis tasks.

ID SOIL-MOISTURE; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; CROP; BRECKLAND; STRESS; UK
AB Precision irrigation requires the mapping of within-field variations of water requirement. Conventional remote sensing techniques provide estimates of water status at only shallow soil depths. The ability of a water sensitive crop, sugar beet, to act as an intermediate sensor providing an integrated measure of water status throughout its rooting depth is tested here. Archive aerial photographs and satellite imagery of Eastern England show crop patterns resulting from past periglacial processes. The patterns were found to be spatially and temporally consistent. Field sampling of soil cores to 1 m depth established that the within-field wilting zones were significantly associated with coarser or shallow soils. The stress classes, determined by classification of the digitised images, were weakly correlated with total available water (Pearson correlation r = 0.588, P < 0.05). These results suggest that wilting in sugar beet can be used as an intermediate sensor for quantifying potential soil water availability within the root zone. Within-field stress maps generated in 1 year could be applied as a strategic tool allowing precision irrigation to be applied to high-value crops in following years, helping to make more sustainable use of water resources.

AB A new approach of integration of remote sensing data with in situ pollen measurements is developed to explore the effect of changing land use on the local pollen records variability. It was conducted in a predominantly agricultural region of Serbia, with the focus on Ambrosia, an invasive weed that is the source of highly allergenic pollen. The land use characteristics were extracted from the Corine Land Cover and more precise crop classification maps for years 2013-2017 created using machine learning from the available satellite (RapidEye, Landsat, Sentinel) and ground truth data. Airborne pollen was collected at five locations for the same period. To integrate in situ and products derived from satellite data we defined catchment areas surrounding pollen measurements stations. Different shapes of assumed catchment areas equivalent to 5 km, 10 km and 30 km radius were tested: circular, wind rose and footprint from SILAM (System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition). The simple fixed circle, used as the rule of thumb in the literature, is a reasonable approximation of the representativeness of the aerobiological data. A gridded Ambrosia distribution and abundance map over Vojvodina was produced by using top-down approach that combines distribution of suitable habitats and airborne pollen concentrations. The results confirmed that variation in the agriculture-associated land use area explains notable amount of variability in the amount of Ambrosia airborne pollen. Detailed crop classification inferred from satellite data revealed the strongest relationship between pollen and variation in areas under soya bean and sugar beet. Maps of Ambrosia infection levels, based on distribution of sugar beet and soya bean fields, instead of total arable land, reveal its additional spatial variability in Vojvodina region.

AB During the last six years we have carried out a series of ground-based microwave measurements on agricultural fields. Bare soils, corn (maize), wheat, sugar-beet, potatoes, grass, canola (rape), oat, and rye were observed under var-ious conditions and phenological stages. Our calibrated radiometer-scatterometer system, RASAM, operates at frequencies between 3 and 11 GHz. The brightness temperature was measured at horizontal and vertical polarization, and the backscattering coefficient at HH, VV, HV, and VH polarization, all at incidence angles from 0-degrees to 70-degrees. In addition we measured soil and vegetation parameters. The data are stored in our signature data base.
   In this article the signature data base is reviewed with respect to crop classification. We find that between mid-June and mid-July it is possible to distinguish the dominant crops of Switzerland (cereals, corn, sugar-beet, potatoes, canola and grass) with two carefully chosen active or passive microwave parameters. The use of multi-temporal data for crop classification is discussed. Microwave remote sensing is able to collect multi-temporal data reliably due to its relative independence of weather conditions. Finally, the signature data base is used to illustrate the signatures of agricultural fields for the system configuration that will be used by the active microwave instrument on the ERS-1 satellite.

AB Convolutional neural network (CNN) has outstanding performance on nature image classification, such as facial recognition, ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. However, due to scale variation of the same object in scene, it's difficult to directly utilize CNN for remote sensing image classification. In order to solve this problem, scene classification based on a random-scale stretched convolutional neural network (SRSCNN) for HSR remote sensing imagery is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, the patches with random scale is cropped from image and stretched to the specified scale as input to train CNN, and in order to further improve the performance of CNN, the proposed method classifies an image multiple times to decide its label by voting. Experimental results using two datasets, i. e. the UC Merced dataset, Google Dataset of SIRI-WHU, show better performance than the traditional scene classification methods.

AB The traditional area extraction method mainly depends on manual field survey methods, it is workload, slow and high cost. While remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, rapidity, macroscopic and dynamic, which has become an effective means to extract crop growing area. In this paper, we took Kaifeng City in Henan Province as the study area. Firstly, we explored the advantages of Sentinel-2A RENDVI in crop identification. Then used the supervised classification SVM, object-oriented classification method and assisted with field measured data to extract the winter wheat planting area, the characteristics of the two methods were compared and analysed. Finally, we combined the above two classification methods and proposed a new classification method V2OAE to remove unnecessary influencing factors. The experiment results showed that RENDVI has better recognition ability than the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in distinguishing vegetation with similar spectrum, the classification effect of object-oriented classification is better than supervised classification SVM, and our classification method removes unnecessary influence factors in the results of object-oriented classification, which is further improve the monitoring accuracy.Firstly, we have preprocessed the Sentinel-2A image data, its steps are: (1) In the first step, we made radiation calibration for remote sensing images to eliminate the image distortion caused by external factors, data acquisition and transmission systems and so on; (2) In the second step, we made atmospheric correction to eliminate changes in the spectral feature of remote sensing images caused by atmospheric absorption or scattering; (3) In the third step, we made band resampling to unify the resolution of remote sensing images and facilitate the mathematical combination operation of vegetation index; (4) In the fourth step, we made mosaic and cutting to get preprocessed remote sensing images of Kaifeng City. Secondly, we analysed the spectral features of each object and established the interpretation mark with the field measured data. then we explored the ability to identify the ground objects based on NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and RENDVI. Third, we used the rule-based object-oriented classification method and SVM classification to extract the planting area of the study area, the input definition of SVM is spectral feature images of ground objects and the output definition of SVM is the recognition result of ground objects in the process of data training. Then the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods in classification results were analysed. Finally, In order to extract winter wheat information more accurately, we combined the above two classification methods and proposed a new classification method V2OAE (Vector Object Oriented Area Extraction) to remove unnecessary influencing factors, then the winter wheat planting area in Kaifeng City was statistically obtained.

AB Our primary objective was extending knowledge of major crop rotations and stand establishment conditions present in 4800 grass seed fields surveyed over three years in western Oregon to the entire Willamette Valley through classification of multiband Landsat images and multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day composite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Mismatch in resolution between MODIS and Landsat data was resolved by edging of training and test validation areas using 3 by 3 neighbourhood tests for class uniformity, resampling of MODIS data to 50-m resolution followed by 3 by 3 neighbourhood smoothing to artificially enhance resolution, and resampling to 30m for stacking data in groups of up to 64, 55 and 81 bands in 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. Imposing several object-based rules raised final classification accuracies to 84.7, 77.1 and 87.6% for 16 categories of cropping practices in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Total grass seed area was under-predicted by 3.9, 5.4 and 1.8% compared to yearly Cooperative Extension Service estimates, with Italian ryegrass overestimated by an average of 8.4% and perennial ryegrass, orchardgrass and tall fescue underestimated by 10.4, 3.3 and 2.1%. Knowledge of field disturbance patterns will be crucial in future landscape-level analyses of relationships among ecosystem services.

AB On-farm pest management and crop protection strongly depend on diagnosis of crop disease stress in fields. In this paper, we first examine the applicability of broadband high-spatial-resolution ADAR (airborne data acquisition and registration) remote sensing data in visible and near infrared regions for rice disease detection and then develop an approach to explore the applicability. Experiments were conducted in 1999 on a large-scale rice field with sheath blight infection in central Arkansas, USA. Based on the measured symptoms, a comprehensive ground disease index (DI) was constructed to indicate the infection severity. Correlations between ground data and image data were analyzed with attempt to develop an applicable method for remote sensing of the rice disease. The results indicate that the broadband remote sensing imagery has valuable capability of application. Some image indices such as the RI14, SDI14 and SDI24 have a correlation of above 0.62, hence are valuable for rice disease identification. A method based on the indices has been developed. Validation with the ground data indicates that the method has an average accuracy of above 70% for classification. The standard estimate error of the method is similar to13%. In spite of this encouraging result, we also realize that it is really difficult to discriminate the healthy plants from light infection ones (DI<20%) because of their heavily overlapping in the estimated image indices. Identification is much more accurate when infection reaches to mediate-to-severe levels (DI>35%). High spectral resolution remote sensing imagery with more bands and narrower bandwidth is required for remote sensing diagnosis of crop disease stress.

AB The objective of this paper is to describe the method of crops pattern change allocation, and to simulate the crops pattern in Heilongjiang province utilizing crop pattern simulator (CROPS) model. In this study, based on interpreted remote sensing data and crops pattern statistical data, CROPS model simulates long time series crop spatial pattern. Firstly, crops pattern and driving factor analysis using the method of logistic regression were described in detail in this article, to identify the probability of spatio-temporal distribution of various crops. Then, the method of spatial distribution of iteration combined with the space distribution probability was applied to allocate statistical data in the study area. Finally, we collect 14 driving factors and other input data to simulate the crop pattern in Heilongjiang Province during 2005-2010. The validation was performed using remote sensing image interpretation result in 2007 to test simulation accuracy. Results showed that it can finely allocate the crops patterns in a region, and provide a basis for analysis of crops spatial dynamics change. This method can produce a series of crop patterns of data and effectively improve the remote sensing interpretation work efficiency.

AB Sanqi is a kind of medicine and food homogenous plant. It is one of the highland characteristic agricultural products that develops in priority of Yunnan Province and also pillar crops of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. It is of great significance for assessing the agricultural development in the region by grasping the planting information quickly. Remote sensing image has the characteristics of wide coverage area and short return period. Therefore, it has become an important mean to quickly understand agricultural situation on the help of remote sensing image to extract crop information. For this reason, based on the remote sensing images of the 30-m resolution Landsat 8 in Maguan County in October 2014, using the OIF best band combination and the maximum likelihood supervised classification method, the spatial information of the Sanqi distribution in Maguan County was extracted. The extraction result was analyzed with an accuracy of 82.3%. The results of extraction can better reflect the regional distribution of Sanqi in Maguan County, and also provide a reference to other regions that plant Sanqi.

AB In classifier (or regression) fusion, the aim is to combine the outputs of several algorithms to boost overall performance. Standard supervised fusion algorithms often require accurate and precise training labels. However, accurate labels may be difficult to obtain in many remote sensing applications. This paper proposes novel classification and regression fusion models that can be trained given ambiguously and imprecisely labeled training data in which the training labels are associated with sets of data points (i.e., "bags") instead of individual data points (i.e., "instances") following a multiple-instance learning framework. Experiments were conducted based on the proposed algorithms on both synthetic data and applications such as target detection and crop yield prediction given remote sensing data. The proposed algorithms show effective classification and regression performance.

AB In this paper, we present a nearest neighbor based hierarchical change detection methodology for analyzing multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. A key contribution of this work is to define change as hierarchical rather than boolean. Based on this definition of change pattern, we developed a novel time series similarity based change detection framework for identifying inter-annual changes by exploiting phenological properties of growing crops from satellite time series imagery. The proposed framework consists of four components: hierarchical clustering tree construction, nearest neighbor based classification, relaxation labeling, and change detection using similarity hierarchy. Though the proposed approach is unsupervised, we present evaluation using manually induced change regions embedded in the real dataset. We compare our method with the widely used K-Means clustering and evaluation shows that K-Means over-detects changes in comparison to our proposed method.

AB The knowledge of the land use is important for the agricultural economy and for defining the deployment of new crops. Thus, a tool for the mapping and quantification of crops is necessary. The development of a tool is possible with the use of remote-sensing images and efficient algorithm classifiers. The objective of this study was to verify the accuracies of indicator kriging and fuzzy classification as supervised classifiers in identifying sugarcane and citrus crops, which are more cultivated in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The investigated area was located on the border of the municipalities of Sao Manuel and Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We used digital images from satellite IRS-P6 (ResourceSat-1; path/row 329/94, January 29, 2011) with a spatial resolution of 23.5 m. In the pre-processing phase, images were prepared for classification using several techniques, such as enhancement, geometric rectification and registration and reduction of dimensionality. In the process of image classification for citrus and sugarcane areas, two methods of classification were utilized, namely indicator kriging (IK) and fuzzy classification, and compared to the visual classification, which was assumed to reflect the reality on the ground (citrus, sugarcane, native vegetation, forest regeneration, soil and water). The classifications were made based on bands 2, 3, 4 and 5 and were evaluated using the kappa index. From the results of the classification of the pictures used for the discrimination and quantification of areas cultivated with citrus and sugarcane, the following conclusions can be drawn: the multispectral bands showed spatial dependence for both citrus and sugarcane, whereas a comparison of the maps revealed that the IK classifier confused citrus with areas of vegetation, and the fuzzy classifier confused citrus with forest regeneration; the IK classifier overestimated the areas of sugarcane crops, whereas the fuzzy classifier underestimated these areas. Based on the kappa index, band 2 (0.52-0.59 mu m) better represented the citrus and sugarcane areas, whereas band 5 (1.55-1.70 mu m) had the worst classification for both the IK and fuzzy algorithms. Citrus crop were best identified using the fuzzy classifier, and the sugarcane crop was best identified using the IK classifier. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cotton is a significant cash crop of China. Timely and accurate cotton area and yield estimation is useful for management decisions related to the cotton procurement and sales. This study is a first research on cotton area and yield estimation based on remote sensing at Zhanhua County which is one of the high-quality cotton production demonstration bases of China. After normalization of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series derived from Huanjin 1 A/B satellite (HJ-1 A/B), decision tree classifier was used to identify the cotton, and then K-Means classifier was applied to estimate cotton yield. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 95% for the cotton area estimation and 91% for the cotton yield classification. With further validation, it suggests that this method can be used to timely achieve the cotton area and growth information of this region.

AB Remote sensing is rightly described as an activity of recording / observing / perceiving (sensing) objects or events that are located at far away (remote) places. In remote sensing, the sensors are not in direct physical contact with the objects or events that are being observed. The information to be sensed needs a physical carrier (say, microwave) to travel from objects/events to the sensing device through an intervening medium (clouds, water vapour, air). Normally, the electromagnetic wave is used as an information carrier. The output of a remote sensing system is usually an image (bi-spectral (grayscale)/ tri-spectral (RGB)/ hyperspectral (many bands)) representing the scene which is being observed. Further steps of image analysis and interpretation(visual/machine) is required in order to extract useful information from the recorded image. In general sense, the human visual system is a classic example of a remote sensing system. Data in the form of 2-D images which are mapped from optical remote sensing, after going through a series of processing steps, is ready for human interpretation and can be used for several applications like mapping of land cover, classification of various crops, in weather forecasting and monitoring, etc. However, the problems of constant cloud coverage and other atmospheric disturbances dominantly persist in optical images that often lead to erroneous data interpretation. So, in order to correctly interpret the mapped mages from satellite or aeroplane platforms, we have to rely on the data received from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that has this unique capability to operate nearly under all weather conditions. Also, SAR imaging used by space-crafts is advantageous over any other method of earth feature mapping (i.e. optical, thermal) as it uses energy harnessed from its on-board solar panels to recharge its batteries and in turn generate the microwave bursts of energy, which it then transmits towards the surface of the earth.
   The primary aim of this paper is to illustrate the crucial point of differences between optical and radar remote sensing and how a real aperture radar (RAR) imaging technique differs from its counterpart i.e. synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in terms of range, azimuth resolution. We have also discussed as to how we can conceptualize a SAR antenna using the properties of RAR.

AB This study aimed to map, separate, and estimate soya bean and corn crop areas in Parana State, Brazil, in the harvest years 2012/13 and 2013/14, using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Thus, two methodologies were integrated, the first considering heterogeneity on the dates of crop cycles, the scenes required to generate images of minimum and maximum vegetation indexes, creating a colour composite red, green, and blue (RGB), and identifying two cultures simultaneously. In the second methodology, soya bean and corn were identified and mapped using the selection of pure pixels and the supervised classification algorithm Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). In order to avoid overlapping areas, we multiplied the results from the first and second methodologies to obtain the final separation. The final validation of the mapping was compared to official data, identifying high correlation to crops. Based on Medium-Resolution Linear Imaging Self-Scanner (LISS-III) and Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat-8) images, the similarity of global accuracy (GA) and kappa accuracy indices was determined, being classified as good and excellent, respectively. It showed that the use of the two consortium methodologies for separation and overlap elimination of these crops in the state of Parana was efficient.

AB The current paper investigates the potential contribution of ENVISAT wide swath (WS) images for discrimination and monitoring of crops at a regional scale. The study was based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired throughout an entire growing season. Advanced synthetic aperture radar sensor (ASAR) images in both narrow swath (NS) and WS modes were simulated based on 15 European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite images recorded over Belgium. Unlike 'real' ASAR imagery, this exercise provided a consistent data set (i.e. same incidence angle, same acquisition date, same acquisition hour) to study the impact of spatial resolution on the SAR signal information content. A quantitative approach using 787 parcels of medium field size and various data combinations assessed monitoring and discrimination capabilities for six crop types: wheat, barley, grasses, sugar beet, maize and potato. The spatial resolution impact of the ASAR sensor was discussed with respect to the field size by comparing the results obtained from NS (30m) and WS (150m) mode images. WS temporal profiles were able to discriminate the various crops of interest and were representative of the crop development observed in the region. Furthermore, parcel-based unsupervised classifications successfully discriminated between grass, wheat, barley and other crops of large parcels (success rate of 83%). Dedicated interpretation schemes were developed in order to discriminate between cereal crops.

DE RADARSAT; SAR; rice; potato; backscatter; classification accuracy
AB The Canadian satellite RADARSAT launched in November 1995 acquires C-band NH polarisation Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in various incident angles and spatial resolutions. Tn this study, the Standard Beam S7 SAR data with 45 degrees-49 degrees incidence angle has been used to discriminate rice and potato crops grown in the Gangetic plains of West Bengal state. Four-dale data acquired in the 24-day repeat cycle between January 2 and March 15, 1997 was used to study the temporal backscatter characteristics of these crops in relation to the growth stages. Two, three and four-date data were used to classify the crops. The results show that the backscatter was the lowest during puddling of rice fields and increased as the crop growth progressed. The backscatter during this period changed from -18 dB to -8 dB. This temporal behaviour was similar to that observed in case of ERS-SAR data. The classification accuracy of rice areas was 94% using four-date data. Two-date data, one corresponding to pre-field preparation and the other corresponding to transplantation stage, resulted in 92%; accuracy. The last observation is of particular interest as one may estimate the crop area as early as within 20-30 days of transplantation. Such an early estimate is not feasible using optical remote sensing data or ERS-SAR data. The backscatter of potato crop varied from -9 dB to -6 dB during the growth phase and showed large variations during early vegetative stage. Two-date data, one acquired during 40-45 days of planting and another at maturing stage, resulted in 93% classification accuracy for potato. All other combinations of two-date data resulted in less than 90% classification accuracy for potato. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation in the US Midwest, overwhelming existing tile drainage, and resulting in temporary soil ponding across the landscape. However, lack of direct observations of the dynamics of temporal soil ponding limits our understanding of its impacts on crop growth and biogeochemical cycling. Satellite remote sensing offers a unique opportunity to observe and analyze this dynamic phenomenon at the landscape scale. Here we analyzed a series of red-green-blue (RGB) and near infrared (NIR) remote sensing images from the Planet Labs CubeSat constellation following a period of heavy precipitation in May 2017 to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of ponding events in the maize-soybean cropland of Champaign County, Illinois USA. We trained Random Forest algorithms for near-daily images to create binary classifications of surface water versus none, which achieved kappa values around 0.9. We then analyzed the morphology of classification results for connected pixels across space and time and found that 2.5% (5180 ha) of this cropland was classified as water surface at some point during this period. The frequency distribution of areal ponding extent exhibited a log-log relationship; the mean and median areas of ponds were 1231 m(2)and 126 m(2), respectively, with 26.1% of identified ponds being at the minimum threshold area of 45 m(2), and 2.5% of the ponds having an area greater than 104 m(2)(1 ha). Ponds lasted for a mean duration of 2.4 +/- 1.7 days, and 2.3% of ponds lasted for more than a week. Our results suggest that transient ponding may be significant at the landscape scale and ought to be considered in assessments of crop risk, soil and water conservation, biogeochemistry, and sustainability.

AB In this contribution we analyze the problem of the fusion of time series of heterogeneous remote sensing images to serve classification and monitoring activities which can aid farming applications such as crop classification, change detection and monitoring. We propose several soft fusion operators that are based on different assumptions and model distinct desired properties. Conducted experiments on various geographic regions have been carried out and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposal.

AB An accurate agricultural statistics act as an important source of decision making to decision makers. Cotton area is very important especially to Xinjiang, which had 3.2 million tons in cotton output for 2012, accounting for half of the national yield. Although the potential of remote sensing to facilitate agriculture management has been explored but still there are grounds of improvement which can be explored to add some tools and process to a more accurate remote sensing based agriculture management system in any area. This research presents a method to estimate cotton area in Xinjiang. Many field data had been accumulated including each main crop through the Big Plot Survey from 2011 to 2013. Meanwhile the MODIS NDVI product were used to build reference NDVI time series, according to the Big Plot Survey result. Higher spatial resolution RS data (Landsat-8 and HuanJing-1) merged NDVI series in 2013. Through the relative NDVI correction, the 30m merged muti-source NDVI series could be classified with sub-region classification method. Gaofen-1 satellite data were employed to validate the cotton distinguish result, which has 2m spatial resolution. Result shown our workflow is efficiency, and the total area of cotton is 1.692 million hectare in Xinjiang 2013.

AB Timely and efficient land-cover mapping is of high interest, especially in agricultural landscapes. Classification based on satellite images over the season, while important for cropland monitoring, remains challenging in subtropical agricultural areas due to the high diversity of management systems and seasonal cloud cover variations. This work presents supervised object-based classifications over the year at 2-month time-steps in a heterogeneous region of 12,000 km(2) in the Sao Paulo region of Brazil. Different methods and remote-sensing datasets were tested with the random forest algorithm, including optical and radar data, time series of images, and cloud gap-filling methods. The final selected method demonstrated an overall accuracy of approximately 0.84, which was stable throughout the year, at the more detailed level of classification; confusion mainly occurred among annual crop classes and soil classes. We showed in this study that the use of time series was useful in this context, mainly by including a small number of highly discriminant images. Such important images were eventually distant in time from the prediction date, and they corresponded to a high-quality image with low cloud cover. Consequently, the final classification accuracy was not sensitive to the cloud gap-filling method, and simple median gap-filling or linear interpolations with time were sufficient. Sentinel-1 images did not improve the classification results in this context. For within-season dynamic classes, such as annual crops, which were more difficult to classify, field measurement efforts should be densified and planned during the most discriminant window, which may not occur during the crop vegetation peak.

AB This research shows a case from Jordan where geospatial techniques were utilized for irrigation water auditing. The work was based on assessing records of groundwater abstraction in relation to irrigated areas and estimated crop water consumption in three water basins: Yarmouk, Amman-Zarqa and Azraq. Mapping of irrigated areas and crop water requirements was carried out using remote sensing data of Landsat 8 and daily weather records. The methodology was based on visual interpretation and the unsupervised classification for remote sensing data, supported by ground surveys. Net (NCWR) and gross (GCWR) crop water requirements were calculated by merging crop evapotranspiration (ETc), calculated from daily weather records, with maps of irrigated crops. Gross water requirements were compared with groundwater abstractions recorded at a farm level to assess the levels of abstraction in relation to groundwater safe yield. Results showed that irrigated area and GCWR were higher than officially recorded cropped area and abstracted groundwater. The over abstraction of groundwater was estimated to range from 144% to 360% of the safe yield in the three basins. Overlaying the maps of irrigation and groundwater wells enabled the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) to detect and uncover violations and illegal practices of irrigation, in the form of unlicensed wells, incorrect metering of pumped water and water conveyance for long distances. Results from the work were utilized at s high level of decision -making and changes to the water law were made, with remote sensing data being accredited for monitoring water resources in Jordan.

AB Remote sensing data particularly Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol SAR) data has shown promising results in crop monitoring and classification with reasonably high accuracy in tropical countries like India. Our study explores the use polarimetric SAR data for crop discrimination by evaluating different polarimetric parameters and various decomposition techniques using single date fine quadpol C-band RADARSAT-2 dataset over heterogeneous agricultural area of Mehsana district of Gujarat state in India. Vegetation parameter, Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and five decomposition techniques (e.g. H/A/a, Freeman-2, Freeman-3, Van Zyl-3 and Krogager) based on incoherent and coherent decompositions were selected to generate input images of classification. RVI shows good correlation with the crop stage at higher biomass with high value of RVI and with urban and water body with lower values of RVI respectively. H/A/a and its combinations i.e. (H-A) and (1-H)(1-A) show good results for discriminating land cover with different scattering mechanisms. Freeman-2, Freeman-3, Van Zyl-3 and Krogager are also evaluated for classification capability between various land covers and different crop types at different phenological stages. In 3-component decompositions, Freeman gives better results compared to other decomposition techniques for discriminating agricultural crops and natural vegetation. VanZyl decomposition overestimates surface component for agricultural crops and vegetation compared to Freeman 3-component decomposition. Krogager decomposition gives better seperability for man-made targets. The limitations of optical data for discrimination of crops based on biophysical parameters at various crop stages with similar spectral signature can be overcome by even single date full polarimetric SAR data with different decomposition techniques.

AB Precision agriculture applications, which include spatially-explicit irrigation scheduling, nutrient application, and disease management, could greatly benefit from accurate assessment of crop physiological stages. Such an identification strategy could contribute to improved timing of crop management interventions and improved yields. Snap bean as a crop, valued at over $400 million dollars annually in the USA, is an example crop that require accurate maturity stage classification, especially in context of disease management and harvest scheduling. This study aimed to assess growth classification of snap bean crop via machine learning approaches over four major maturity stages, namely vegetative growth, budding, flowering, and pod formation using hyperspectral data, in a greenhouse setting. Our classification results show high discrimination (mean-per-class accuracy = 0.69-0.82) in a one-vs-rest fashion with both parametric and non-parametric classifiers, such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest, and perceptron. These results show promise for potential extension to remote sensing solutions that would allow growers to better manage their crops.

AB The Hungarian Agricultural Remote Sensing Program led to a concise methodology that could further be applied operationally. First the main results of a substantial R&D investment and methodology plus validation results are summarized in the paper. The crops area assessment, through the processing of multitemporal Landsat and IRS-1C/1D data proved to be efficient at county level because of the accuracy of thematic classification. The novel combined high resolution images + NOAA AVHRR series based crop yield forecast methodology performed well for the major crops (8) at county level. Based on the experiences of the first 5 operational years (from 1997) a general evaluation on the Operational Crop Monitoring and Production Forecast Program (CROPMON) is given. The CROPMON system is a good platform for additional projects implementation as in the case of a serious waterlog assessment and impact analysis in spring, 1999 or flood monitoring in 2000, and the remote sensing control of national area-based agricultural subsidies (CwRS), which is carried out operationally for the third year in 2002 in Hungary.

AB Multi-temporal deep learning approaches have exhibited excellent classification performance in large-scale crop mapping. These approaches efficiently and automatically transform remote sensing time series into highdimensional feature representations to identify crop types. The lack of interpretation, however, is regarded as a major drawback of these high-performance approaches. Interpreting deep learning approaches in multitemporal crop mapping is critical for verifying their reliability. This study aims to quantify the impact of multi-temporal information in input time series on classification performance and develop a multi-perspective interpretation pipeline for deep learning models. The pipeline involves three interpretation approaches: evaluating input feature importance, analyzing hidden features, and monitoring temporal changes in model's soft output. An experiment is conducted to classify corn and soybean in the U.S corn belt in 2018. The study area consists of three sites each encompassing millions of pixel-level samples at 30 m resolution. The Landsat Analysis Ready Data are used as the input remote sensing time series and Cropland Data Layer is used as the ground reference. Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (AtLSTM) and Transformer models are built as multitemporal deep learning models, and compared to Random Forest (RF). Complete time series input in the correct order achieves a higher overall accuracy of 97.8% than using single-window or out-of-order inputs, indicating multi-temporal information facilitates crop classification. An assessment of the input feature importance demonstrates that the AtLSTM, Transformer, and RF models all consider the period from weeks 11 to 20 (earlyJuly to late-August) as a key growth period and the shortwave infrared band as the critical band for corn and soybean discrimination. Hidden feature analysis suggests that the AtLSTM model accumulates the useful information over the growth period, while the Transformer model extracts the temporal dependencies that contribute important information to high-level feature learning. The learned features contain more effective and refined information than the raw input features and thus are better suited for crop classification. The soft output analysis in the in-season classification scenario demonstrates that increased length of input time series improves the model's confidence in the classification results. The further comparison of input feature importance in different sites and years demonstrates the applicability of the interpretation approach at larger spatiotemporal extents with heterogeneous landscapes and interannual variability. This study provides a multi-perspective evaluation to identify key features in multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing data, and yields a practical approach to integrate agronomy knowledge in deep learning-based crop mapping.

AB Crop acreage analysis and yield estimation are of prime importance in field-level agricultural monitoring and management. This enables prudent decision making during any crop failure event and for ensuing crop insurance. The free availability of the high resolution Sentinel-2 satellite datasets has created new possibilities for mapping and monitoring agricultural lands in this regard. In the present study conducted on the Tamluk Subdivision of the Purba Medinipur District of West Bengal, the heterogeneous crop area was mapped according to the respective crop type, using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images and two machine learning algorithms-K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). Plot-level field information was collected from different cropland types to frame the training and validation datasets (comprising 70% and 30% of the total dataset, respectively) for cropland classification and accuracy assessment. Through this, the major summer crop acreage was identified (Boro rice, vegetables and betel vine-the three main crops in the study area). The extracted maps had an overall accuracy of 97.16% and 97.22%, respectively, in the KNN and RF classifications, with respective Kappa index values of 95.99% and 96.08%, and the RF method proved to be more accurate. This study was particularly useful in mapping the betel leaf acreage herein since scant information exists for this crop and it is cultivated by many smallholder farmers in the region. The methods used in this paper can be readily applied elsewhere for accurately enumerating the respective crop acreages.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

AB Remote Sensing technology has been used in agricultural statistics since early 1970s in developed countries and since late 1970s in China. It has greatly improved the efficiency with its accurate, timingly and credible information. But agricultural monitoring using remote sensing has not yet been assessed with credible data in China and its accuracy seems not consistent and reliable to many users. The paper reviews different methods and the corresponding assessments of agricultural monitoring using remote sensing in developed countries and China, then assesses the crop area estimating method using Landsat TM remotely sensed data as sampling area in Northeast China. The ground truth is gathered with global positioning system and 40 sampling areas are used to assess the classification accuracy. The error matrix is constructed from which the accuracy is calculated. The producer accuracy, the user accuracy and total accuracy are 89.53%, 95.37% and 87.02% respectively and the correlation coefficient between the ground truth and classification results is 0.96. A new error index delta is introduced and the average delta of rice area estimation to the truth data is 0.084. delta measures how much the RS classification result is positive or negative apart from the truth data.

AB Recent advancements in low-cost remote sensing equipment and techniques have proven that crop parameter classification can be practical in agricultural situations. One problem still remaining is how to account for in-field variability of mixed ground-cover areas. This study focused on finding a non-invasive method of screening low ground-cover areas before assessing crop nitrogen (N) status. Four years of plot data were used where intense ground sampling was coupled with nadir-viewing remotely sensed data from a ground-based remote sensing system. Data were collected over irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) with both light and dark soil backgrounds to develop a relationship between leaf area index (LAI) and remotely sensed data. An index based on subtracting the red from the green reflectance (green-red) was shown to be strongly related to LAI. A concurrent assessment of the N reflectance index (NRI) over the four-year study indicated that the corn N status classification improved with increasing LAI. Using the (green-red) index and a screening value corresponding to an LAI of 2.5, the data from the four-year study were screened and the NRI was reassessed. The initial screening removed all bare-soil and many of the measurements collected before the V12 growth stage. In this example, 94.0% of the data associated with LAI below 2.5 was correctly filtered out, and 95.4% of the data collected over areas with LAI at or above 2.5 correctly passed the filter This method of filtering was shown to be highly effective in screening low ground-cover and bare-soil areas before class if cation. Future incorporation of this technique into on-the-go filtering algorithms could improve crop parameter classification from remotely sensed measurements in early-season and mixed vegetative cover situations.

AB It is important to derive crop type information for the assessment of cropland evapotranspiration and water management for an irrigation area. Remote sensing is one of the most valuable technologies for this purpose. In this paper, the identification of crops using ETM+, MODIS EVI time series data and GIS field border data was investigated. Firstly, spectral response signature of crops and MODIS EVI time series features were analysed in detail to supply knowledge for further classification. Secondly, field block objects were formed by segmenting ETM+ images in terms of GIS field border. The Standard Nearest Neighbor Fuzzy Classification algorithm was applied for an initial per-field classification based on ETM+ and MODIS EVI time series data. Then, the initial classification result was improved with the aid of the growth phenology of different crops based on MODIS EVI time series data and their combination. Finally, accuracy assessment of classification result was performed. It is shown that the crop classification accuracy has been improved by >20% compared with that of the supervised maximum likelihood classification method and a per-field method in which a field block is assigned as the dominant crop class occurring in this field block. The result indicates that the method proposed in the paper is effective for crop classification.

AB The spatial and temporal variations of crop species and rotation types play a key role in crop yield estimation, natural resources management and climate change research. Remote sensing is an effective approach for monitoring agricultural management at the regional scale. However, the lack of remote sensing data with high spatiotemporal resolutions results in a generally limited crop mapping accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we employed an improved flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (IFSDAF) model to conduct data fusion using MODIS and Landsat imagery and extract NDVI time series with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Following this, we proposed a Random-Forest-based model and a decision-rule-based model for mapping crop species and rotation types. According to the accuracy assessment, the Random-Forest-based model with an overall accuracy of 90 % was more suitable for mapping crops with two or more growing seasons, such as double-cropping rice. Meanwhile, the decision-rule-based model with an overall accuracy of 89.7 % was more suitable for monitoring crops with only one growing season compared to the Random-Forest-based model. In comparison with traditional ways such as field survey, the classification models proposed in this study provide useful information for better monitoring spatiotemporal variations of crops species and rotation types, and guiding agricultural management accordingly.

AB Remote sensing imagery, such as that provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat satellites, has been widely used to study environmental protection, hazard analysis, and urban planning for decades. Clouds are a constant challenge for such imagery and, if not handled correctly, can cause a variety of issues for a wide range of remote sensing analyses. Typically, cloud mask algorithms use the entire image; in this study we present an ensemble of different pixel-based approaches to cloud pixel modeling. Based on four training subsets with a selection of different input features, 12 machine learning models were created. We evaluated these models using the cropped LC8-Biome cloud validation dataset. As a comparison, Fmask was also applied to the cropped scene Biome dataset. One goal of this research is to explore a machine learning modeling approach that uses as small a training data sample as possible but still provides an accurate model. Overall, the model trained on the sample subset (1.3% of the total training samples) that includes unsupervised Self-Organizing Map classification results as an input feature has the best performance. The approach achieves 98.57% overall accuracy, 1.18% cloud omission error, and 0.93% cloud commission error on the 88 cropped test images. By comparison to Fmask 4.0, this model improves the accuracy by 10.12% and reduces the cloud omission error by 6.39%. Furthermore, using an additional eight independent validation images that were not sampled in model training, the model trained on the second largest subset with an additional five features has the highest overall accuracy at 86.35%, with 12.48% cloud omission error and 7.96% cloud commission error. This model's overall correctness increased by 3.26%, and the cloud omission error decreased by 1.28% compared to Fmask 4.0. The machine learning cloud classification models discussed in this paper could achieve very good performance utilizing only a small portion of the total training pixels available. We showed that a pixel-based cloud classification model, and that as each scene obviously has unique spectral characteristics, and having a small portion of example pixels from each of the sub-regions in a scene can improve the model accuracy significantly.

AB Recent advances in remote sensing have shown great potential for different kind of applications like vegetation and crop supervision. Using hyperspectral images (HSI), this process can be performed over large areas of land, allowing for a fast and non-invasive analysis of variables such as water stress, diseases, type of crops, among many others. In this context, representative spatial-spectral features are crucial to develop the data classification process of hyperspectral remote sensing images. In this way, the use of deep learning networks has shown a remarkable classification performance in many applications as the processing of hyperspectral images. In this paper, a data classification model that use kernel PCA (K-PCA) and inception network architecture to generate deep spatial-spectral features is proposed. The features generated are used to label the different kind of classes into the HSI. The labeling process uses a logistic regression (LR) algorithm. This model was validated using six different datasets. The experiments performed shown that the proposed strategy allows improving the data classification performance regarding the results obtained by the traditional stacked layer model of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Quantitatively speaking, the overall accuracy over all experiments of the proposed model for all tested datasets is greater than 92%.

AB The agrarian policy of the European Union tends to support sustainable agriculture, subsidising only cropping systems that are implemented with specific agro-environmental measures. These actions require a precise follow-up of the crops and of the agricultural practices over a large surface. To that end, remote-sensing techniques are unique and cost-effective. We developed here a digital land cover classification in the Mediterranean dryland, mapping and assessing the main cropping systems and some agro-environmental measures such as cover crops in olive orchards and crop stubble for reducing soil erosion. We analysed a high spatial resolution satellite image (QuickBird) taken in early summer around Montilla, southern Spain. Images of the four broad wavebands, six band ratios and three vegetation indices were extracted from the satellite image and studied for the discrimination of nine land covers. The classified regions were determined by applying adequate boundary digital values to the selected images. Our results show that the land covers were discriminated with an overall accuracy of about 90%. Images of the normalised difference vegetation index and the ratio vegetation index discriminated between vegetation and non-vegetation zones. The visible wavebands discriminated roadside trees and herbaceous crops, and the near-infrared waveband highways and urban soil plus bare soil. The ratios blue/green and red/green were useful for distinguishing non-burnt stubble. The burnt stubble area was discriminated through the adapted burnt area index. Olive orchards were classified once the regions of vegetation, non-vegetation and non-burnt stubble were extracted. This technology will be a useful tool of agroecology control for the administration and will be a substitute for the current follow-up of cropping systems by ground visits. It can also be used on a farm level in order to help farmers and technicians to make decisions about the management of sustainable agricultural practices.

AB The Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) is an agricultural drought index derived from multiple remote sensing datasets including precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and temperature and vegetation index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The SDCI can be used for large-scale drought monitoring at a high spatial resolution in dry and humid regions. However, it is not applicable to certain areas for numerous reasons, including the discontinued service and limited coverage of the TRMM, uncertainties associated with the coarse resolution of precipitation input, the fixed lag time between precipitation deficit and vegetation responses, experimental weights and an arbitrary classification scheme. Therefore, this study aims to propose an optimal SDCI (OSDCI) using an alternative Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) as precipitation input, adding a varied lag time between precipitation and vegetation response, determining the optimal weights of variables and revising the severity classification. In Central Asia, OSDCI is calibrated using the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during the 2001-2008 growing seasons as drought reference. The SPEI from 2009 to 2016, soil moisture anomalies (SMAs) derived from both the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), and the annual crop production of wheat and barley are used for cross-validation. For comparison, three original SDCIs are also included. The results show that the OSDCI displays better performance than the three experimental SDCIs with higher correlation coefficients relative to SPEI and SMA from the CPC for different cover types, and performance is comparable to that of SMA from the GLDAS and annual crop production. Additionally, the OSDCI based on the revised classification scheme (OSDCI_rev) shows significant superiority over the OSDCI based on the original classification system (OSDCI org) with lower drought frequency and area error. Furthermore, the OSDCI_rev can capture both the temporal evolution and the spatial patterns of droughts exemplified by the SPEI and SMAs. Overall, the results of this study show the potential use of the OSDCI with a revised classification scheme as a remote sensing drought index for agricultural drought monitoring.

AB Changes in summer irrigated cropland acreage and related water use are estimated from satellite remote sensing and ancillary data in semi-arid Southeastern Turkey where traditionally dry agricultural lands are being rapidly transformed into irrigated fields with the help of water from the Euphrates-Tigris Rivers. An image classification methodology based on thresholding of Landsat NDVI images from the peak summer period reveals that the total area of summer irrigated crops has increased three-fold (from 35,000 ha to over 100,000) in the Harran Plain between 1993 and 2002. Coupled analysis of annual irrigated crop area from remote sensing and potential evapotranspiration based estimates of irrigation water requirements for cotton indicate a corresponding increase in agricultural water use from about 370 million cubic meters to over one billion cubic meters, a volume in accordance with the state estimates. These estimates have important implications for understanding the rapid changes in current agricultural withdrawals in Southeastern Turkey and form a quantitative basis for exploring the changes in future water demands in the region. For example, expansion of irrigated lands have led to a steady decrease in potential evaporation due to increased roughness and decreased humidity deficit in the Harran Plain. Assuming that the changes in future evaporation conditions will be of similar nature, water use for irrigation is expected to decrease over 40 percent in future irrigation sites. Incorporating this decrease in overall planning of the irrigation projects currently under construction should lead to improved management, and by extension, sustainability of water resources in the region.

AB In order to hide secrete information in remote sensing image, we proposed an algorithm for secrete information hiding which was adaptive to the feature of remote sensing image. Firstly, we segmented and extracted the secrete information in remote sensing image, and made supplement of gray values in the area corresponding with the secrete information and then produced the disguised remote sensing image which was wiped off secrete information. Then we used for reference the idea of digital watermarks and feature of HVS (Human Visual System) and embedded the secrete sub-image imperceptibly and adaptively into the disguised remote sensing image to produce the disguised remote sensing image in which there hid secrete sub-image. In addition, during the course of extracting secrete information and resuming the remote sensing image, this algorithm didn't need the original remote sensing image and was a blind one. To those algorithms for information hiding, imperceptivity and amount of hidden information are the most important and robustness is less. And experimental results show that this algorithm is not only quite transparent and has a good effect for large amount of secrete information hiding, but also has a strong robustness against such image attacks as JPEG lossy compression, median filtering, noise adding, scaling, cropping and rotation. Furthermore this algorithm has no influence on such applications as edge detection and image classification of the disguised remote sensing image which has been hidden the secrete information.

AB Maps of irrigated areas are essential for Ghana's agricultural development. The goal of this research was to map irrigated agricultural areas and explain methods and protocols using remote sensing. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data and time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to map irrigated agricultural areas as well as other land use/land cover (LULC) classes, for Ghana. Temporal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pattern obtained in the LULC class were used to identify irrigated and non-irrigated areas. First, the temporal variations in NDVI pattern were found to be more consistent in long-duration irrigated crops than with short-duration rainfed crops due to more assured water supply for irrigated areas. Second, surface water availability for irrigated areas is dependent on shallow dug-wells (on river banks) and dug-outs (in river bottoms) that affect the timing of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the seasonal NDVI pattern. A decision tree approach using Landsat 30 m one time data fusion with MODIS 250 m time-series data was adopted to classify, group, and label classes. Finally, classes were tested and verified using ground truth data and national statistics. Fuzzy classification accuracy assessment for the irrigated classes varied between 67 and 93%. An irrigated area derived from remote sensing (32,421 ha) was 20-57% higher than irrigated areas reported by Ghana's Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA). This was because of the uncertainties involved in factors such as: (a) absence of shallow irrigated area statistics in GIDA statistics, (b) non-clarity in the irrigated areas in its use, under-development, and potential for development in GIDA statistics, (c) errors of omissions and commissions in the remote sensing approach, and (d) comparison involving widely varying data types, methods, and approaches used in determining irrigated area statistics using GIDA and remote sensing. Extensive field campaigns to help in better classification and validation of irrigated areas using high (30 m) to very high (< 5 m) resolution remote sensing data that are fused with multi temporal data like MODIS are the way forward. This is especially true in accounting for small yet contiguous patches of irrigated areas from dug-wells and dug-outs.

AB The Deep Learning (DL) methods can automatically extract features without artificial prior, provides an effective solution for multi-temporal crop classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have superb spatial-spectral feature extraction capabilities, but often lack consideration of the temporal relationship of multi-temporal images, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can better learn the sequential variation pattern. This paper designed a deep spatial-temporal-spectral feature learning network (CropNet) combining the advantages of a deep spatial-spectral feature learning module and a deep temporal-spectral feature learning module for better feature extraction in crop classification from time-series remote sensing images. From the results, the proposed method has better crop classification effects from time-series multispectral images in our experimental areas compared with some common traditional machine learning approaches and common DL methods.

AB Since from 2011 when the Syrian Civil War broke out, at least 470,000 people have died (with 1.9 million wounded). In March 2015, Al Jazeera estimated 10.9 million Syrians or almost half the population who have been displaced which has been one of the most severe humanitarian disasters since World War II.Therefore, it is difficult to monitor humanitarian conditions in Syria during the war. Remotely sensed imagery which can record Earth' s surface information from outer space has been proved to be an efficient and objective data source for evaluating armed conflicts.This paper uses Syria two river basins as research areas. Based on the spatial and temporal scales of the study and the complex characteristics of the crop planting structure in Syria, the region has a total of 12 remote sensing images for 19 months between 2010 and 2017 with 456 remote sensing images. The selected TM/OLI image is selected as a suitable data source for the study. Here, 50 km of two river basins and 5 remote sensing images of each intercepted, and a total of 120 remote sensing images process. Combining crop phenology information, month are are taken to using time series NDVI curves, and comparing the similarity of the NDVI time series curve with the reference time series curve of the to be-segme nte d pixels, we established the rules and object-oriented classification method to extract the crop planting structure information of Syria and the two river basins between 2010 and 2017. These include mainly crops of sugar beet, cotton, wheat, and orchards, and analyze the impact of the war on changes in the crop planting structure. The main findings and characteristics are as following:(1)When the ground survey sample cannot be obtained, establishing a rule through the existing crop growth process to select crops whose growth process values are in full compliance with the sample, and establishing reference NDVI time series curves of various crops for object-oriented class ification.(2)The experimental results show that during the civil war between the two river basins in Syria during the period from 2010 to 2017, large areas of farmland were abandoned, beet, cotton, wheat, and fruit trees were caused by reduced, and crop yields were reduced by 1/2. The area of abandoned farmland duringthe Civil War is an important indicator of immigration, death, and trauma. This also explains the great damage caused by the war.(3)The range and total area of crops in Syria and the total area extracted from remote sensing imagery in 2010 are similar to those of survey data. This shows that it is feasible to extract Syria's 2017 crop distribution in accordance with the above-mentioned method and ensure the reliability of the results with authenticity.

AB The results of a remotely sensed imagery classification depend on a lot of elements (information classes, remote sensed images, conditions of image acquisition, the spectral and spatial resolution etc.) but, mainly, how the classification algorithm is trained. In this work, a new pattern characterization is proposed. Its main property is that the spatial variability component is considered in the own pattern; that is to say, the problems inherited from the confidence boundary location of the spectrally homogeneous zones are avoided. The corn crop spatial pattern in the 18th aquifer of the Mancha Oriental (Spain) has been used as the test bed.

AB Agricultural UAV-based remote sensing tools to facilitate decision-making for increasing productivity in developing countries were developed and tested. Specifically, a high-quality multispectral sensor and sophisticated-yet-user-friendly data processing techniques (software) under an open-access policy were implemented. The multispectral sensor-IMAGRI-CIP-is a low-cost adaptable multi-sensor array that allows acquiring high-quality and low-SNR images from a UAV platform used to estimate vegetation indexes such as NDVI. Also, a set of software tools that included wavelet-based image alignment, image stitching, and crop classification have been implemented and made available to the remote sensing community. A validation field experiment carried out at the International Potato Center facilities (Lima, Peru) to test the developed tools is reported. A thorough comparison study with a wide-used commercial agricultural camera showed that IMAGRI-CIP provides highly correlated NDVI values (R-2 >= 0.8). Additionally, an application field experiment was conducted in Kilosa, Tanzania, to test the tools in smallholder farm settings, featuring high-heterogeneous crop plots. Results showed high accuracy (> 82%) to identify 13 different crops either as mono-crop or as mixed-crops.

AB Agriculture plays a critical role within Canada's economy and, as such, sustainability of this sector is of high importance. Targeting and monitoring programs designed to promote economic and environmental sustainability are a vital component within Canada's agricultural policy. A hierarchy of land information, including up to date information on cropping practices, is needed to measure the impacts of programs on land use decision-making and to gauge the environmental and economic benefits of these investments. A multi-year, multi-site research activity was completed to develop a robust methodology to inventory crops across Canada's large and diverse agricultural landscapes. To move towards operational implementation the methodology must deliver accurate crop inventories, with consistency and reliability. In order to meet these operational requirements and to mitigate risk associated with reliance on a single data source, the methodology integrated both optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The results clearly demonstrated that multi-temporal satellite data can successfully classify crops for a variety of cropping systems present across Canada. Overall accuracies of at least 85% were achieved, and most major crops were also classified to this level of accuracy. Although multi-temporal optical data would be the preferred data source for crop classification, a SAR-optical dataset (two Envisat ASAR images and one optical image) provided acceptable accuracies and will mitigate risk associated with operational implementation. The preferred dual-polarization mode would be VV-VH. Not only were these promising classification results repeated year after year, but the target accuracies were met consistently for multiple sites across Canada, all with varying cropping systems.

AB This study assesses the potential of spectrotemporal indices derived from satellite image time series (SITS) to improve the classification accuracy of fruit-tree crops. Six major fruit-tree crop types in the Aconcagua Valley, Chile, were classified by applying various linear discriminant analysis (LDA) techniques on a Landsat-8 time series of nine images corresponding to the 2014-15. growing season. As features we not only used the complete spectral resolution of the SITS, but also all possible normalized difference indices (NDIs) that can be constructed from any two bands of the time series, a novel approach to derive features from SITS. Due to the high dimensionality of this "enhanced" feature set we used the lasso and ridge penalized variants of LDA (PLDA). Although classification accuracies yielded by the standard LDA applied on the full-band SITS were good (misclassification error rate, MER = 0.13), they were further improved by 23% (MER = 0.10) with ridge PLDA using the enhanced feature set. The most important bands to discriminate the crops of interest were mainly concentrated on the first two image dates of the time series, corresponding to the crops' greenup stage. Despite the high predictor weights provided by the red and near infrared bands, typically used to construct greenness spectral indices, other spectral regions were also found important for the discrimination, such as the shortwave infrared band at 2.11-2.19 pm, sensitive to foliar water changes. These findings support the usefulness of spectrotemporal indices in the context of SITS-based crop type classifications, which until now have been mainly constructed by the arithmetic combination of two bands of the same image date in order to derive greenness temporal profiles like those from the normalized difference vegetation index.

AB Artificial Immune System (AIS), is a paradigm developed based on natural human immune system, that has a useful set of organizing principles such as memory, recognition, adaptability and distributability.
   Soil moisture content along with an evaluation of the energy status of soil water (soil moisture) helps in better crop management. Classifying the soil basing on its soil moisture needs the processing of enormous data on seasonal and diurnal variables such as soil temperature and moisture collected using remote sensing technique. There has been several paradigms studied for the processing of remote sensing data, such as classical classification algorithms, ANN. Some of these paradigms are efficient. Earlier some studies were made using ANN with two different training algorithms, viz., backpropagation (BP) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), on the remote sensing data. Those studies showed accuracy ranging from 96.68 to 98.8%.
   Artificial Immune System is relatively a new paradigm and least studied. In this paper, an attempt is made to study the feasibility of applying AIS to pattern classification. The results of the study are presented and directions for further development are discussed.

AB Soil is one of the most important factors for agricultural production. In tropical regions, soil variability is considerable, with the most diverse combinations of physical and chemical characteristics, an influence factor in crop growth and productivity. In this research, the main objective was to identify how soil characteristics and parent material can influence sugarcane development over time using remote sensing. An area located in Sao Paulo, Brazil, of 182 ha (one point per ha with soil analysis), with high variability in the parent material and soil types, was selected. Images from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite were used to describe the spectral behavior of sugarcane over a period of one year. The NDRE (normalized difference red-edge index) was calculated for each image and then the leaf area index (LAI) was obtained from it. Maps of soil classes, soil properties at two depths (0-0.20 and 0.80-1.0 m), and parent material classes were related to sugarcane LAI variability over time. Production environment zones, which is a classification based on soil characteristics to support sugarcane development, were also obtained and related to LAI variability. Spectral signatures of the crop presented different behaviors through the season, soil types and soil attributes provided useful responses for this variability. At the beginning of the season, the surface and subsurface soil properties (texture and fertility) impacted differently on crop development. On the other hand, soil classes and parent material influenced LAI in all production environments studied. The results indicated that the soil types and their properties at different depths have a significant impact on sugarcane development. Furthermore, RS was able to monitor the plant evolution and be related to soil types which may assist in plant management. The results can bring light on how better sugarcane management can be conducted using remote sensing data and soils variability.

AB Plastic mulching is an important technology in agricultural production both in China and the rest of the world. In spite of its benefit of increasing crop yields, the booming expansion of the plastic mulching area has been changing the landscape patterns and affecting the environment. Accurate and effective mapping of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) can provide useful information for leveraging its advantages and disadvantages. However, mapping the PMF with remote sensing is still challenging owing to its varying spectral characteristics with the crop growth and geographic spatial division. In this paper, we investigated the potential of Radarsat-2 data for mapping PMF. We obtained the backscattering intensity of different polarizations and multiple polarimetric decomposition descriptors. These remotely-sensed information was used as input features for Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results indicated that the features from Radarsat-2 data have great potential for mapping PMF. The overall accuracies of PMF mapping with Radarsat-2 data were close to 75%. Although the classification accuracy with the back-scattering intensity information alone was relatively lower owing to the inherent speckle noise in SAR data, it has been improved significantly by introducing the polarimetric decomposition descriptors. The accuracy was nearly 75%. In addition, the features derived from the Entropy/Anisotropy/Alpha (H/A/Alpha) polarimetric decomposition, such as Alpha, entropy, and so on, made a greater contribution to PMF mapping than the Freeman decomposition, Krogager decomposition and the Yamaguchi4 decomposition. The performances of different classifiers were also compared. In this study, the RF classifier performed better than the SVM classifier. However, it is expected that the classification accuracy of PMF with SAR remote sensing data can be improved by combining SAR remote sensing data with optical remote sensing data.

AB Recent developments in hyperspectral remote sensing technologies enable acquisition of image with high spectral resolution, which is typical to the laboratory or in situ reflectance measurements. There has been an increasing interest in the utilization of in situ reference reflectance spectra for rapid and repeated mapping of various surface features. Here we examined the prospect of classifying airborne hyperspectral image using field reflectance spectra as the training data for crop mapping. Canopy level field reflectance measurements of some important agricultural crops, i.e. alfalfa, winter barley, winter rape, winter rye, and winter wheat collected during four consecutive growing seasons are used for the classification of a HyMAP image acquired for a separate location by (1) mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF), (2) spectral feature fitting (SFF), and (3) spectral angle mapper (SAM) methods. In order to answer a general research question "what is the prospect of using independent reference reflectance spectra for image classification", while focussing on the crop classification, the results indicate distinct aspects. On the one hand, field reflectance spectra of winter rape and alfalfa demonstrate excellent crop discrimination and spectral matching with the image across the growing seasons. On the other hand, significant spectral confusion detected among the winter barley, winter rye, and winter wheat rule out the possibility of existence of a meaningful spectral matching between field reflectance spectra and image. While supporting the current notion of "non-existence of characteristic reflectance spectral signatures for vegetation", results indicate that there exist some crops whose spectral signatures are similar to characteristic spectral signatures with possibility of using them in image classification.

AB This paper describes an approach in which multitemporal Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data from the pre-planting season, when the cloud cover is minimal, was used in order to evaluate the area to be planted with annual crops in the rainy season. Both supervised and non-supervised classification of multitemporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images were evaluated. The interpretation of the areas to be planted with summer crops was based on field work, NDVI temporal profiles, unitemporal classifications, and the crop calendar of the region. A correction based on the error matrix was applied to the classification and the results were compared to the estimation provided by the official agencies using kappa statistics analysis. The proposed method was shown to be a feasible alternative for improving the crop estimation programme, especially for the tropical countries where the cloud cover has restricted the use of optical remote sensing data.

AB This study explores the classification potential of a multispectral classification model for farmland with planting structures of different complexity. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology is used to obtain multispectral images of three study areas with low-, medium-, and high-complexity planting structures, containing three, five, and eight types of crops, respectively. The feature subsets of three study areas are selected by recursive feature elimination (RFE). Object-oriented random forest (OB-RF) and object-oriented support vector machine (OB-SVM) classification models are established for the three study areas. After training the models with the feature subsets, the classification results are evaluated using a confusion matrix. The OB-RF and OB-SVM models' classification accuracies are 97.09% and 99.13%, respectively, for the low-complexity planting structure. The equivalent values are 92.61% and 99.08% for the medium-complexity planting structure and 88.99% and 97.21% for the high-complexity planting structure. For farmland with fragmentary plots and a high-complexity planting structure, as the planting structure complexity changed from low to high, both models' overall accuracy levels decreased. The overall accuracy of the OB-RF model decreased by 8.1%, and that of the OB-SVM model only decreased by 1.92%. OB-SVM achieves an overall classification accuracy of 97.21%, and a single-crop extraction accuracy of at least 85.65%. Therefore, UAV multispectral remote sensing can be used for classification applications in highly complex planting structures.

AB Quantitative land evaluation procedures, namely USDA Land Capability Classification (LCC) and FAO Land Evaluation Procedure for Soil Site Suitability for various land utilization types have been used to assess the land suitability for different crops and for generating cropping pattern for kharif (summer) and rabi (winter) seasons in a watershed. The database on soil, land use/land cover rainfall, and temperature was generated from data derived from Landsat TM remote sensing satellite and soil survey to perform an integrated analysis in the geographic information system environment. Arable and non- arable lands were delineated in the watershed using the USDA LCC and non- arable areas were masked for removal from future analysis. Different land quality parameters, viz. soil texture, depth, erosion, slope, flooding and course fragments under various land units were evaluated for a number of crops. Subsequently all of them were integrated using a sequence of logical operations to generate the land suitability maps for various crops. Kharif and rabi season cropping patterns were developed by integrating crop suitability maps for the winter and summer seasons separately. Finally, cropping system maps for the watershed were obtained by integrating the two season cropping sequences within the crop calendar. Results indicated that the present agricultural area of 47% could be increased to 71% by adopting scientific land evaluation methods for watershed development. It was also found that better land-use options could be implemented in different land units as the conventional land evaluation methods suffer from limitation of spatial analysis for the suitability of various crops.

AB Plant leaves, as a vital organ of the plant photosynthesis, directly reflects the plant growth and nutrition status. Internal physicochemical property model, based on the reflection and transmission of plant leaf, indirectly reflects the information of matter and energy exchange in the process of plant growth information, which can be the premise and foundation of the plant growth process of fine management. The optical properties of plant leaves plays a great significant role in the field of crop nutrition diagnosis and plant morphological structure based on remote sensing, in the field of virtual plant light transmission simulation and computer graphics et al. BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) mainly focused on spatial distribution and spectral characteristics of the reflected light on the surface of the object characteristics. It can characterize crop growth parameters accurately and efficiently by acquiring optical properties information of plant leaves, which also has great advantages in the research and application of remote sensing in agriculture. In order to better apply BRDF technology in the agricultural remote sensing, this paper will focus on BRDF measurement and device, model development and classification and its application in the field of plants remote sensing. Eventually, although BRDF technology is still in early exploration stage and is facing many tough challenges, it has a promising future in terms of digital agriculture development.

AB Machine learning has been successfully used for object recognition within images. Due to the complexity of the spectrum and texture of construction and demolition waste (C&DW), it is difficult to construct an automatic identification method for C&DW based on machine learning and remote sensing data sources. Machine learning includes many types of algorithms; however, different algorithms and parameters have different identification effects on C&DW. Exploring the optimal method for automatic remote sensing identification of C&DW is an important approach for the intelligent supervision of C&DW. This study investigates the megacity of Beijing, which is facing high risk of C&DW pollution. To improve the classification accuracy of C&DW, buildings, vegetation, water, and crops were selected as comparative training samples based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and Sentinel-2 was used as the data source. Three classification methods of typical machine learning algorithms (classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)) were selected to classify the C&DW from remote sensing images. Using empirical methods, the experimental trial method, and the grid search method, the optimal parameterization scheme of the three classification methods was studied to determine the optimal method of remote sensing identification of C&DW based on machine learning. Through accuracy evaluation and ground verification, the overall recognition accuracies of CART, RF, and SVM for C&DW were 73.12%, 98.05%, and 85.62%, respectively, under the optimal parameterization scheme determined in this study. Among these algorithms, RF was a better C&DW identification method than were CART and SVM when the number of decision trees was 50. This study explores the robust machine learning method for automatic remote sensing identification of C&DW and provides a scientific basis for intelligent supervision and resource utilization of C&DW.

AB The accurate and timely information of crop area is vital for crop production and food security. In this study, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) integrated crop phenological information was used to estimate the maize cultivated area over a large scale in Northeast China. The fine spatial resolution China's Environment Satellite (HJ-1 satellite) images and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm were employed to discriminate distribution of maize in the reference area. The mean MODIS-EVI time series curve of maize was extracted in the reference area by using multiple periods MODIS-EVI data. By analysing the temporal shift of crop calendars from northern to southern parts in Northeast China, the lag value was derived from phenological data of twenty-one agro-meteorological stations; here integrating with the mean MODIS-EVI time series image of maize, a standard MODIS-EVI time series image of maize was obtained in the whole study area. By calculating mean absolute distances (MAD) map between standard MODIS-EVI image and mean MODIS-EVI time series images, and setting appropriate thresholds in three provinces, the maize cultivated area was extracted in Northeast China. The results showed that the overall classification accuracy of maize cultivated area was approximately 79%. At the county level, the MODIS-derived maize cultivated area and statistical data were well correlated (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 283.98) over whole Northeast China. It demonstrated that MODIS-EVI time series data integrated with crop phenological information can be used to improve the extraction accuracy of crop cultivated area over a large scale.

AB Identifying which crop is growing in certain areas is important to many national and multinational agricultural agencies for forecasting grain supplies, monitoring farming activity, facilitating crop rotation records, etc. In order to achieve that, the agencies require to schedule censuses on a regular basis. Recently, different techniques based on remote sensing have been applied to collect the information and perform a crop classification task. In this paper, we described a methodology to perform a crop classification task based on the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The proposed methodology selects the set of features from the GLCM that allow classify the crops with a good accuracy using the ABC algorithm in terms of a distance classifier. The accuracy of the proposed methodology was tested over a specific region of Mexico and compared against different distance classifiers.

AB Along the season crop classification maps based on satellite data is a challenging task for countries with large diversity of agricultural crops with different phenology (crop calendars). In this paper, we investigate feasibility of delivering early and along the season crop specific maps using available free satellite data over multiple years, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. For this study, a test site in Kyiv region (Ukraine) is selected, for which we have been collecting ground data on crop types every year since 2011. Crop type maps are generated through a supervised classification of multi-temporal multi-source satellite data using previously developed artificial neural network algorithms. It is shown, how multi-year crop classification maps are used for crop rotation violation detection. The study shows that in case of considerable cloud cover, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, for example acquired by Sentinel-1 satellite, can be interchangeably used with optical imagery to achieve the target 85% accuracy for crop classification.

Based on the unique crop planting characteristics in southern part of China, this paper take typical southern farm in Honghu City, Hubei Province as an example, adopting the platform of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to carry hyperspectral imaging spectrometer to obtain the "double high" (high spectral and high spatial resolution) images at the same time. To complete the crop fine classification of 'double high' images, the CNN-CRF algorithm is proposed. The CNN-CRF algorithm acquires 91.5% accuracy with only 1% train samples on remote sensing images, which performs far better than most traditional classification approaches.

AB An attempt was made to estimate acreage and to depict the spatial distribution of mango growing areas using linear imaging self-scanning image of remote sensing data for Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The image was processed using ENVI software. Unsupervised, supervised and decision tree classification were used for the acreage estimation. The study has clearly demonstrated the usefulness of remote sensing image for identifying and acreage estimation of mango orchards. The results also indicated that mango acreage estimation was more accurate in decision tree approach (92.92%) as compared to other two methods (81.73 and 80.43%, respectively). The overall result revealed that the finer resolution the time series data, better the accuracy of area estimation. The above study proves that the remote sensing data could be effectively used for other perennial horticultural crops with finer resolution time series data.

AB A greater percentage of Northern Ghana is under threat of land degradation and is negatively impacting on the well-being of the people owing to deforestation, increasing incidence of drought, indiscriminate bush burning and desertification. The problem is becoming severe with serious implications on the livelihoods of the people as the land is the major resource from which they eke their living. Reversing land degradation requires sustainable land use planning which should be based on detailed up-to-date information on landscape attributes. This information can be generated through remote sensing analytical studies. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this study to collect data for planning by employing remote sensing techniques and ground truthing.
   The analysis included satellite image classification and change detection between Landsat images captured in 1989, 1999 and 2006. The images were classified into the following classes: water bodies, close savannah woodland, open savannah woodland, grassland/unharvested farmland, exposed soil, burnt scars, and settlement. Change detection performed between the 1989 and 1999 and 1989 and 2006 showed that the environment is deteriorating. Land covers such as close savannah woodland, open savannah woodland and exposed soil diminished over the period whereas settlement and water bodies increased. The grassland/unharvested farmland showed high increases because the images were captured at the time that some farms were still crops or crop residue.
   Urbanization, land clearing for farming, over grazing, firewood fetching and bush burning were identified as some of the underlying forces of vegetal cover degradation. The socio-cultural beliefs and practices of the people also influenced land cover change as sacred groves as well as medicinal plants are preserved. Local knowledge is recognized and used in the area but it is not properly integrated with scientific knowledge for effective planning for sustainable land management. This is due to lack of expertise in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) in the area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an economically important crop that is highly susceptible to cotton root rot. Remote sensing technology provides a useful and effective means for detecting and mapping cotton root rot infestations in cotton fields. This research assessed the potential of 10-m Sentinel-2A satellite imagery for cotton root rot detection and compared it with airborne multispectral imagery using unsupervised classification at both field and regional levels. Accuracy assessment showed that the classification maps from the Sentinel-2A imagery had an overall accuracy of 94.1% for field subset images and 91.2% for the whole image, compared with the airborne image classification results. However, some small cotton root rot areas were undetectable and some non-infested areas within large root rot areas were incorrectly classified as infested due to the images' coarse spatial resolution. Classification maps based on field subset Sentinel-2A images missed 16.6% of the infested areas and the classification map based on the whole Sentinel-2A image for the study area omitted 19.7% of the infested areas. These results demonstrate that freely-available Sentinel-2 imagery can be used as an alternative data source for identifying cotton root rot and creating prescription maps for site-specific management of the disease.

AB Monitoring changes in paddy area is important since rice is staple food, and paddy agriculture is a major cropping system in Asia. The decision trees or stochastic analysis based methods using spatiotemporal satellite sensor data is effective to monitor paddy area by the remote sensing. On the other hand, it is difficult to apply the same models for different countries and regions. Therefore we applied artificial neural network to classify paddy area in order to automatically generate the classifier. From the computer simulation, the proposed paddy classifier yielded high classification rate in the data subset of north region of Chiba. However, the accuracy was corrupted by the difference of annual cycle pattern. Thus, in this paper, we investigate an administrative division based data segmentation method in order to divide the data set into different groups so that the different patterns of paddy annual cycle is divided to different groups.

TI Geo-parcel-based crop classification in very-high-resolution images via
   hierarchical perception
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTISCALE; FUSION
AB The basic application of remote sensing is classifying surface objects in images. Traditional pixel-based or object-based classification methods are poorly suited to very high-resolution (VHR) images captured by remote sensors with high spatial resolutions. In the field of computer vision, deep learning has recently achieved great advances in natural image processing. Inspired by this, we propose a methodology guided by hierarchical perception to classify crops in VHR images based on geo-parcels. Geo-parcel-based crop classification is used in agriculture and in refined farmland management. The proposed methodology can be divided into three steps: zoning, location and quality. In the first step, the image is divided into blocks based on the road network. In the second step, geographical entities are extracted from every block defined in the zoning step. In the last step, the geographical entity types are identified based on the texture information. These steps provide mutual constraints. In each step, the information is extracted by neural networks that have been adapted to the VHR images. The experimental results indicate that our methodology performs well, with a precision greater than 90%. Furthermore, our methodology combines deep learning techniques and theory regarding image perception by humans, providing a valuable method for processing remote sensing information.

AB In the present study, potential evapotranspiration (PET) is estimated using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) data. Linear imaging self-scanning sensor (LISS-III) satellite images of Tapi river basin area were used in the present study. The study area is classified into five different zones, namely forest land, agricultural land, barren land, urban land and water bodies by supervised classification. NDVI values for the respective zones (class) were used to estimate crop coefficient (Kc) using linear regression model. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated from Penman Monteith model and PET was calculated by multiplying the Kc and ETo. The results obtained by this methodology were validated using actual evapotranspiration. A new linear model was developed for the study area between NDVI and Kc. Developed methodology for the determination of Kc derived from RS data and NDVI-Kc model may be useful for irrigation scheduling and estimating water use efficiency.

AB With the improvement of remote sensing technology, the spatial, structural and texture information of land covers are present clearly in high resolution imagery, which enhances the ability of crop mapping. Since the satellite RapidEye was launched in 2009, high resolution multispectral imagery together with wide red edge band has been utilized in vegetation monitoring. Broad red edge band related vegetation indices improved land use classification and vegetation studies. RapidEye high resolution imagery was used in this study to evaluate the potential of red edge band in agricultural land cover/use mapping using an objected-oriented classification approach. A new object-oriented decision tree classifier was introduced in this study to map agricultural lands in the study area. Besides the five bands of RapidEye image, the vegetation indexes derived from spectral bands and the structural and texture features are utilized as inputs for agricultural land cover/use mapping in the study. The optimization of input features for classification by reducing redundant information improves the mapping precision about 18% for AdaTree. WL decision tree, and 5% for SVM, the accuracy is over 90% for both classifiers.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has become a mainstream data collection platform in precision agriculture. For more accessible UAV-visible imagery, the high spatial resolution brings the rich geometric texture features triggered large differences in same crop image's features. We proposed an encoder-decoder's fully convolutional neural network combined with a visible band difference vegetation index (VDVI) to perform deep semantic segmentation of crop image features. This model ensures the accuracy and the generalization ability, while reducing parameters and the operation cost. A case study of crop classification was conducted in Chengdu, China, where classified four crops, namely, maize, rice, balsam pear, and Loropetalum chinese, it was shown more effective results. In addition, this study explores a fine crop classification method based on visible light features, which is feasible with low equipment cost, and has a prospect of application in crop survey based on UAV low altitude remote sensing.

   vehicles; remotely piloted aircraft; remote sensing
AB Small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) are often suited to applications where the cost, resolution, and (or) operational inflexibility of conventional remote sensing platforms is limiting. Remote sensing with small UASs is still relatively new, and there is limited understanding of how the data are acquired and used for scientific purposes and decision making. This paper provides practical guidance about the opportunities and limitations of small UAS-based remote sensing by highlighting a small sample of scientific and commercial case studies. Case studies span four themes: (i) mapping, which includes case studies to measure aggregate stockpile volumes and map river habitat; (ii) feature detection, which includes case studies on grassland image classification and detection of agricultural crop infection; (iii) wildlife and animal enumeration, with case studies describing the detection of fish concentrations during a major salmon spawning event, and cattle enumeration at a concentrated animal feeding operation; (iv) landscape dynamics with a case study of arctic glacier change. Collectively, these case studies only represent a fraction of possible remote sensing applications using small UASs, but they provide insight into potential challenges and outcomes, and help clarify the opportunities and limitations that UAS technology offers for remote sensing of the environment.

AB Image time series, such as Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) or MRI functional sequences in the medical domain, carry both spatial and temporal information. In many pattern recognition applications such as image classification, taking into account such rich information may be crucial and discriminative during the decision making stage. However, the extraction of spatio-temporal features from image time series is difficult to handle due to the complex representation of the data cube. In this paper, we present a strategy based on Random Walk to build a novel segment-based representation of the data, passing from a 2D+t dimension to a 2D one, more easily manipulable and without losing too much spatial information. Such new representation is then used to feed a classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to learn spatio-temporal features with only 2D convolutions and to classify image time series data for a particular classification problem. The influence of the way the 2D+t data are represented, as well as the impact of the network architectures on the results, are carefully studied. The interest of this approach is highlighted on a remote sensing application for the classification of complex agricultural crops.

AB Crops and spatial distribution of their planting area are two important factors for agricultural water management. Remote sensing has been proved an effective technique in agricultural monitoring. Crop recognition and sown area monitoring are important topics in agricultural remote sensing using data sources from variety of sensors. This paper made efforts in extracting winter wheat and its sown area in an irrigation district along the lower Yellow River stream using the newly launched CBERS-02B sensor. Based on selection of the winter wheat training samples, spectral features, NDVI, MSAVI, spatial information of soils and texture analysis, a rule sets were developed for extracting winter wheat and its sown area. Google Earth was also employed to identify specific ground truth at a high resolution. It is tentatively concluded that the newly launched CBERS-02B CCD data is a reliable source for remote sensing monitoring for agriculture. The rule-based method proposed in this paper has improved the accuracy of crop monitoring. Integration of the spectral information, texture information, information of soils and land use/cover into the rule sets has strengthened identification capacity of the rule-based method. Compared to the unsupervised classification result, the rule-based crop recognition method achieved a better accuracy. Google Earth is a powerful tool which can be employed in sample selection and accuracy assessment. Its high resolution makes lots of small objects identifiable and identification mixed classes possible.

AB High mapping accuracies occur where crops differ spectrally (e. g. > 90.0%; canola, corn, soybeans) and vice versa (e. g. < 75.0%; cereals and pasture). Developing improved mapping methods has been an ongoing priority of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) remote-sensing science. To this end, this study tests a data-driven object-based classification method using Discriminant Analysis (DA) method for mapping cereals and pasture from satellite data. In this approach, variables (number > 400) derived from the image segmentation and object-based feature extraction of multi-date and multi-band optical (RapidEye) and microwave (RADARSAT-2) imagery were applied in a data-driven approach. We use in situ and satellite information collected over two study sites with different levels of heterogeneity (Winnipeg, Brandon) situated in the Canadian Prairies during the 2013 growing season to assess: (a) the type of DA model that most accurately classifies the cereals and pasture cover classes; and (b) how the classification accuracies obtained by the application of this DA model compare to those obtained from more traditional Maximum Likelihood (ML), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) classifications. We found that our DA-based approach was able to map cereals and pastures at our two study sites with the highest accuracies, but these accuracies did not improve significantly with the use of more complex DA model (including priori classification probabilities, more input principle components (PCs), the use of weights proportional to field area). Our results are encouraging for the wider application of the data-driven preprocessing of the inputs to the image classification by DA.

AB Crop type information such as its location and spatial distribution is relevant for agricultural planning and decision making about food sustainability and security. This information can be obtained through the analysis of images obtained through optical satellite remote sensing. Activities such as accurate discrimination of crops require dense time-series of satellite data which can capture the diverse crop phenology. However, given the presence of clouds at important periods of crops' development, the required time-series is impossible to obtain from just one optical satellite sensor. The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project by NASA provides fused data from both Operational Land Imager and Multispectral Instrument optical sensors of Landsat and Sentinel systems respectively. The present study used a multi-temporal HLS data and a target-oriented cross-validation (TOV) modelling approach with random forest algorithm to discriminate 13 crop types. 15 phenological metrics derived from time-series HLS data, together with 48 spectral and 2 topographic information were used as predictors in the model. A forward feature selection (FFS) procedure of the TOV was used to improve the classification model. 16 predictors comprising of spectral, phenological and topographic information were selected as useful for the crop discrimination. An independent accuracy assessment of the final model based on the selected predictors by the FFS procedure resulted in an overall accuracy of 76%. While most of the crop classes, achieved higher producer's and user's accuracies (>80%), the discrimination accuracies of potato, summer oat and winter triticale were comparatively low (<60%). Based on the outcome of the FFS, three models consisting of different predictor combinations, were further developed to ascertain the contribution of the predictors. A comparison of the models showed that the addition of phenological metrics increased the discrimination performance of the model as a whole and for cereals in particular. However, the inclusion of the topographic information did not have any significant effect on the overall model performance. Therefore, future crop type discrimination research in areas with similar terrain characteristics like Northern Hesse should reconsider the use of topographic predictors. Overall, our findings depict that the TOV modelling approach based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor data is promising for effective, accurate and practical crop type discrimination.

AB Recent developments in remote sensing technology, in particular improved spatial and temporal resolution, open new possibilities for estimating crop acreage over larger areas. Remotely sensed data allow in some cases the estimation of crop acreage statistics independently of sub-national survey statistics, which are sometimes biased and incomplete. This work focuses on the use of MODIS data acquired in 2001/2002 over the Rostov Oblast in Russia, by the Azov Sea. The region is characterised by large agricultural fields of around 75 ha on average. This paper presents a methodology to estimate crop acreage using the MODIS 16-day composite NDVI product. Particular emphasis is placed on a good quality crop mask and a good quality validation dataset. In order to have a second dataset which can be used for cross-checking the MODIS classification a Landsat ETM time series for four different dates in the season of 2002 was acquired and classified. We attempted to distinguish five different crop types and achieved satisfactory and good results for winter crops. Three hundred and sixty fields were identified to be suitable for the training and validation of the MODIS classification using a maximum likelihood classification. A novel method based on a pure pixel field sampling is introduced. This novel method is compared with the traditional hard classification of mixed pixels and was found to be superior.

AB Recent advances in remote sensing have shown great potential for different kinds of applications such as vegetation and crop supervision. Using hyperspectral image processing, this process can be used to assess large areas of land, allowing for a fast and non-invasive analysis of variables such as water stress, diseases, and type of crops. In this context, representative spatial-spectral features are crucial for developing the data classification process of hyperspectral remote sensing images. In this way, extended attribute profiles (EAPs) are a powerful tool for efficiently capturing spatial and spectral properties. In addition, deep learning networks have shown a remarkable feature extraction performance in many applications, such as in the processing of hyperspectral images. In this paper, a data classification model is proposed that uses EAPs and an inception network to generate deep spatial-spectral features, which are labelled using a Riemannian classifier as a fine-tuning stage. This model was validated using three different datasets. Results obtained shows that the classification strategy proposed in this paper has better performance regarding the results generated by a traditional model of stacked convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Quantitatively speaking, the overall accuracy for the experiments with the proposed model and the tested data sets is greater than 99%.

Initially to get the spectral differences among the crops both visual as well as digital classifications were performed particularly a number band ratios were generated. Based on the obtained NDVI values the crop classes were categorized and then matched with the plot based GPS survey data including the farmers information. The achieved discrimination was cross checked with the statistical analysis of data (ANOVA) obtained from the same spectral regions of the image where the maximum discriminations were noticed. Then a web based information development application was designed and managed with the help of QuantumGIS and published on the web through web2 leaflet along with the basic function-alities such as advanced queries, overlay analysis of vector layers, PAN, Zoom etc., with a view to provide the users an easy access to GIS data as well as on the internet with a minimum technological knowhow.

AB Crop classification is one of the focused topics in remote sensing study nowadays. Optical imageries, although providing much information, are often contaminated with cloud or other weather effects while SAR imageries are more resilient to those. Temporal series data are often used to improve classification accuracy, especially in crop classification. This article investigates the usage of temporal series SAR imagery on crop classification in vast rural areas of China. The selected area of interest has a complicated, heavily mixed agriculture as well as lots of nonagricultural landcovers. Total ten classes are considered, six of them being crop types. A pixel-based classifier using subspace kth nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is applied to open source Sentinel-1 polarized SAR data. Discussion includes analyzing temporal features of the SAR observation, time domain smoothing, feature engineering, different classification algorithms, and selection of temporal series. The study results in an overall accuracy of 98.2% for the ten classes in fivefold cross validation, indicating a propitious application for agricultural monitoring using SAR data.

AB This study aimed at exploring different remote sensing (RS) techniques for quantitatively measuring vegetation and bare soil fractions in dune ecosystems along the Kenyan coast. The accurate measurements of field samples are required by Kenya Wildlife for environmental monitoring. The current methodology for measuring fractions (ecological surveys) is biased, expert dependent and subjective, and for this reason, remote sensing techniques have been explored to find a better cost-effective alternative.
   Three methods were carried out to estimate different vegetation coverages in field samples and to analyze their performance: classification of photography's taken by hand-held camera, unmixing of aerial photographs, unmixing of Crop scan and Field spec spectral measurements. For these purposes 32 plots of 1x1square meters distributed in 4 transects were selected and measured in the dune ecosystem.
   According to the field spectral measurements, different targets (lichens, vascular plants, mosses, and bare soil) showed a large spectral variation and overlapping between their spectral signatures. Therefore, classification methods and unmixing techniques led to poor results since they are based upon the spectral signature of the targets.
   The hand held camera method proved more accurate than Field Spec, Aerial photograph and Crop Scan. Therefore, from the remote sensing methods, this is the best method when considering accuracy. The performance of this method could be improved by adding an extra band (Infrared for instance). This extra band would allow operators to identify and classify better different kind of vegetation in the image.

AB Accurate and timely information about rice planting areas is essential for crop yield estimation, global climate change and agricultural resource management. In this study, we present a novel pixel-level classification approach that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract the features of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series curve for classification. The goal is to explore the practicability of deep learning techniques for rice recognition in complex landscape regions, where rice is easily confused with the surroundings, by using mid-resolution remote sensing images. A transfer learning strategy is utilized to fine tune a pre-trained CNN model and obtain the temporal features of the EVI curve. Support vector machine (SVM), a traditional machine learning approach, is also implemented in the experiment. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the two models. Results show that our model performs better than SVM, with the overall accuracies being 93.60% and 91.05%, respectively. Therefore, this technique is appropriate for estimating rice planting areas in southern China on the basis of a pre-trained CNN model by using time series data. And more opportunity and potential can be found for crop classification by remote sensing and deep learning technique in the future study.

AB Timely crop information, i.e. well before harvesting time and at first stages of crop development, can benefit farmers and producer organizations. The current case study documents the procedure to deliver early data on planted tomato to users, showing the potential of Sentinel 2 (S2) to map tomato at the very beginning of the crop season, which is a challenging task. Using satellite data, integrated with ground and aerial data, an initial estimate of area planted with tomato and early tomato maps were generated in seven main production areas in Italy. Estimates of the amount of area planted with tomato provided similar results either when derived from field surveys or from remote-sensing-based classification. Tomato early maps showed a producer accuracy >80% in seven cases out of nine, and a user accuracy >80% in five cases out of nine, with differences attributed to the varying agricultural characteristics and environmental heterogeneity of the study areas. The additional use of aerial data improved producer accuracy moderately. The ability to identify abrupt growth changes, such as those caused by natural hazards, was also analysed: S2 detected significant changes in tomato growth between a hailstorm-affected area and a control area. The study suggests that S2, with enhanced spectral capabilities and open data policy, represents very valuable data, allowing crop monitoring at an early development stage.

AB This paper presents an evaluation framework followed to identify cost-efficient alternatives to extend the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), run by the European Commission Joint Research Centre since 1992, to other main producing areas of the world: Eastern European Neighbourhood, Asia, Australia, South America and North America. These new systems would follow the principles and components of the MCYFS Europe: a meteorological data infrastructure, a remote sensing data infrastructure, a crop modelling platform, statistical tools, a team of analysts and a crop area estimation component. The framework designed evaluates the performance of the possible MCYFS-like system realizations against six defined objectives and their costs. Possible monitoring systems are based on a combination of different technical solutions for each of the MCYFS components, and are evaluated through an automatic algorithm that calculates the expected system performance -relying on a priori expert judgement-, the costs, and possible risks to construct some technical solutions, to finally identify the cost-efficient ones. A baseline system, achieving the minimum required performance, was identified as the most efficient starting point for the MCYFS extension in all the geographical areas. Such system would be built upon: (i) near real-time reanalysis meteorological products; (ii) remote sensing data from low-resolution (similar to 1 km) platforms with a long-term product archive; (iii) crop models based on crop-specific model calibration from experimental data published in scientific literature; (iv) statistical methods based on trend and regression analysis applied to national level; (v) a team of analysts with specific technical profiles (on meteorology, remote sensing, and agronomy); and (vi) digital classification of very high resolution imagery supported by non-expensive ground surveys for area estimation. In countries where accessibility to local data and resources is high the baseline system can be upgraded enhancing some of the components: sub-national statistical analysis with additional statistical methods like multiple regression or scenario analysis; recruitment of experts on local agricultural conditions in the team of analysts; local calibration of crop models with experimental data; and exploiting high and low resolution biophysical products from remote sensing for crop monitoring.

AB There are increasing societal and plant industry demands for more accurate, objective and near real-time crop production information to meet both economic and food security concerns. The advent of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite platform has augmented the capability of satellite-based applications to monitor large agricultural areas at acceptable pixel scale, cost and accuracy. Fitting parametric profiles to growing season vegetation index time series reduces the volume of data and provides simple quantitative parameters that relates to crop phenology (sowing date, flowering). In this study, we modelled various Gaussian profiles to time sequential MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images over winter crops in Queensland, Australia. Three simple Gaussian models were evaluated in their effectiveness to identify and classify various winter crop types and coverage at both pixel and regional scales across Queensland's main agricultural areas. Equal to or greater than 93% classification accuracies were obtained in determining crop acreage estimates at pixel scale for each of the Gaussian modelled approaches. Significant high to moderate correlations (log-linear transformation) were also obtained for determining total winter crop (R-2=0.93) areas as well as specific crop acreage for wheat (R-2=0.86) and barley (R-2=0.83). Conversely, it was much more difficult to predict chickpea acreage (R-2<0.26), mainly due to very large uncertainties in survey data. The quantitative approach utilised here further had additional benefits of characterising crop phenology in terms of length of growing season and providing regression diagnostics of how well the fitted profiles matched the EVI time series. The Gaussian curve models utilised here are novel in application and therefore will enhance the use and adoption of remote sensing technologies in targeted agricultural application. With innate simplicity and accuracies comparable to other more convoluted multi-temporal approaches it is a good candidate in determining total and specific crop acreage estimates in future national and global food security frameworks.

AB The operational use of remote sensing images to map coffee fields in large areas, in order to obtain reliable and timely agricultural statistics, is still under development. Several factors raise difficulties to correctly identify and map the coffee crop. However, technological advances observed in the last years, in terms of image acquisition with improved quality and greater quantity, as well as the development of new tools for image analysis, is favoring the development of an operational method that may contribute to establish the official coffee crop statistics in Brazil. Therefore, the present work has the objective to describe the method and to present the result of the coffee fields mapped in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo using remote sensing images and geoprocessing techniques. The methodological approach consisted of four steps: a) image restoration and georeferencing; b) non-supervised classification; c) visual interpretation on the computer screen to suppress omission and commission errors; and d) coffee crop area estimation. The results indicated that the applied method was appropriate to map the coffee crop in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo.

AB Radar remote sensing has a significant role to play in remote sensing based crop inventory programmes due to its independence from cloud cover. In this study, an attempt has been made to evaluate the utility of temporal ERS-1 SAR data to classify rice crop grown in different growing environments. The sites represent four major types of lowland cultivation practice prevailing in India. Results showed more than 90% classification accuracy for all types of wetland rice using three-date SAR data. Data acquired during the early vegetative stage were found essential for high accuracy. The accuracy was mainly affected by the presence of rivers/streams in the scene. High accuracy was obtained for lowland intermediate and irrigated rice areas. A significant effect of wind was observed on the radar backscatter from stagnant water bodies but not on the rice fields during early growth stages. The study indicates the feasibility of operational use of ERS SAR data for estimation of areas of rice crop grown under lowland cultural practice.

AB Machine learning has found many applications in remote sensing. These applications range from retrieval algorithms to bias correction, from code acceleration to detection of disease in crops, from classification of pelagic habitats to rock type classification. As a broad subfield of artificial intelligence, machine learning is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow computers to "learn" by example. The major focus of machine learning is to extract information from data automatically by computational and statistical methods. Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in developing a machine learning methodology for a variety of Earth Science applications involving trace gases, retrievals, aerosol products, land surface products, vegetation indices, and most recently, ocean applications. In this chapter, we will review some examples of how machine learning has already been useful for remote sensing and some likely future applications.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in remote sensing scene classification and identification due to their ability to capture deep spatial feature representations. However, the performance of deep models inevitably encounters a bottleneck when multimodality-dominated scene classification rather than single-modality-dominated scene classification is performed, due to the high similarity among different categories. In this study, we propose a novel multi-granularity fusion convolutional neural network (MGFN) to automatically capture the latent ontological features of remote sensing images. We firstly design a multigranularity module that can progressively crop input images to learn multigrained features, which can describe images to different degrees. Based on a comparison of different granularities, we then design a maxout-based module to learn the corresponding Gaussian covariance matrices of different granularities, which can extract second-order features to express the latent ontological essence of inputs and select the most distinguished inputs. We thirdly provide an adaptive fusion module to fuse all features via normalization to combine features of different degrees using the adaptive fused module. Finally, an SVM classifier is used to classify the fused matrix of every input image. Extensive experimentation and evaluations, particularly for multimodality-dominated scenes, demonstrate that the proposed network can achieve promising results for public remote sensing datasets.

AB This paper presents application of UAV imaging platforms for vegetation analysis. Remote sensing using a UAV, also known as low altitude remote sensing is performed to acquire RGB images for vegetation analysis. Two UAV platforms, a VTOL quadcopter and a fixed wing UAV, were used to obtain the images. Crop region classification was carried out on images acquired from VTOL quadcopter to demonstrate its use in applications such as inspections that require hovering of UAVs while tree crown classification was carried out on images acquired from the fixed wing UAV to demonstrate its use in applications that requires coverage over a relatively larger area. Classification was performed for crop region mapping and tree crown mapping using spectral-spatial method. In this proposed method, Bayesian information criterion was used to determine the constraint of optimal number of clusters for a given image. Keeping this constraint, divisive approach was performed using k-means and EM algorithm for clustering the dataset. On these clusters, the agglomerative approach was used to merge the dataset. The merging was done using percentage voting. Further, to improve the classification efficiency, spatial classification was applied. UAV images obtained using the two UAV platforms were used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. A performance comparison of the proposed spectral-spatial classification with the other classification methods is presented. From the obtained results, it was concluded that the proposed spectral-spatial classification performs better and was more robust than the other algorithms in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB High-resolution crop mapping is of great significance in agricultural monitoring, precision agriculture, and providing critical information for crop yield or disaster monitoring. Meanwhile, medium resolution time-series optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can provide useful phenological information. Combining high-resolution satellite data and medium resolution time-series images provides a great opportunity for fine crop mapping. Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) is a state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithm that shows the advantages of efficiency and high accuracy. However, the application of SNIC in crop mapping based on the combination of high-resolution and medium-resolution images is unknown. Besides, there is still little research on the influence of the superpixel size (one of the key user-defined parameters of the SNIC method) on classification accuracy. In this study, we employed a 2 m high-resolution GF-1 pan-sharpened image and 10 m medium resolution time-series Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Instrument (C-SAR) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) images to carry out rice mapping based on the SNIC method. The results show that with the increase of the superpixel size, the classification accuracy increased at first and then decreased rapidly after reaching the summit when the superpixel size is 27. The classification accuracy of the combined use of optical and SAR data is higher than that using only Sentinel-2 MSI or Sentinel-1 C-SAR vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) or vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) data, with overall accuracies of 0.8335, 0.8282, 0.7862, and 0.7886, respectively. Meanwhile, the results also indicate that classification based on superpixels obtained by SNIC significantly outperforms classification based on original pixels. The overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of SNIC superpixel-based classification increased by 9.14%, 17.16%, 27.35% and 1.36%, respectively, when compared with the pixel-based classification, based on the combination of optical and SAR data (using the random forest as the classifier). The results show that SNIC superpixel segmentation is a feasible method for high-resolution crop mapping based on multi-source remote sensing data. The automatic selection of the optimal superpixel size of SNIC will be focused on in future research.

AB Soil salinity is a huge problem negatively affecting physiological and metabolic processes in plant life, ultimately diminishing growth and yield. An area with more than 70,000 ha sugarcane farming and its by-products are the major agricultural activities in the Khuzestan province, in the southwest of Iran. Therefore, mapping and identification of soil salinity is the most important issue to improve management of large scale crop production in this area. Besides labour intensive fieldwork, remote sensing is the most suitable technique to assess soil salinity for large areas. This study was carried out to investigate the capability of Hyperion spaceborne hyperspecteral data for mapping the salinity stress in the sugarcane fields and determine the best method to classify soil salinity into 3 classes (low, moderate and high salinity). For this purpose the capability of different classification methods like support Vector Machine (SVM), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Minimum Distance (MD) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) in conjunction with different band combinations (all bands, principle component analysis (PCA), Vegetation Indices) as an input data was performed. Results indicated that best method for classification is SVM classifier when we use all bands or PCA(1-5) as an input data for classification with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 78.7% and 0.68 respectively. Therefore, salinity stress can be classified in agricultural fields using Hyperion satellite imagery with good accuracy and salinity map can be very useful for management of agricultural activity and increase the crop production.

TI Crop mapping in countries with small-scale farming: a case study for

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
ID LAND-COVER; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY
AB Remote sensing is nowadays considered to be a valuable input for the annual collection of crop statistics. Derived crop maps can serve as a baseline for yield or area estimation or to target next year's census. For subsistence farming, where small parcels are mixed with other land use, crop mapping remains very challenging. This article evaluates the potential of discriminating crops in West Shewa, an area with small-scale farming in central Ethiopia. A hard classification of high-resolution (30m) images, yielding good results for commercial farming, could not deal with mixed pixels due to the small parcels. Very high resolution (4m) images have a more appropriate pixel size, although they only cover subsets of the region. The very high resolution classification was used to calibrate a neural network for sub-pixel classification of the high resolution images. The accuracies were not satisfactory, but did at least demonstrate the potential of this approach.

AB Crop classification based on multitemporal multisensor remote sensing imagery has a great significance. As more and more Earth observation satellites are launched, it becomes easier to obtain increasingly dense multitemporal data, and the category patterns hidden in multitemporal data can be more and more finely mined and expressed. However, the traditional classification methods treat the features of different temporal periods consistently, so the classification performances are not well enough, especially for the categories with subtle phenological differences. In this paper, we propose a temporal-attention CNN-GRU (Convolutional Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Unit Networks) approach to distinguish subtle crop differences, and the temporal attention mechanism introduced in the model can achieve the effect of enhancing phenological differences and suppressing phenological similarity. Firstly, we use the GRU networks to model the temporal correlation of the multitemporal data. And then, the temporal attention layer utilize a query module to retrieve "what is the important information" over the whole temporal sequence, so we can obtain the attention weights for each temporal period. In the experiments, multitemporal samples are collected from Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8. Due to the different spatial resolutions of multiband images, transposed convolution which can extract the raw spatial structure information is used for multiband features fusion. Experimental results on multitemporal data show that the proposed approach achieve the best performance compared with conventional methods, especially for the categories with similar phenological laws.

AB With the improvement of remote sensing technology, the spatial, structural and texture information of land covers are present clearly in high resolution imagery, which enhances the ability of crop mapping. Since the satellite RapidEye was launched in 2009, high resolution multispectral imagery together with wide red edge band has been utilized in vegetation monitoring. Broad red edge band related vegetation indices improved land use classification and vegetation studies. RapidEye high resolution imagery acquired on May 29 and August 9th of 2012 was used in this study to evaluate the potential of red edge band in agricultural land cover/use mapping using an objected-oriented classification approach. A new object-oriented decision tree classifier was introduced in this study to map agricultural lands in the study area. Besides the five bands of RapidEye image, the vegetation indexes derived from spectral bands and the structural and texture features are utilized as inputs for agricultural land cover/use mapping in the study. The optimization of input features for classification by reducing redundant information improves the mapping precision over 9% for AdaTree. WL, and 5% for SVM, the accuracy is over 90% for both approaches. Time phase characteristic is much important in different agricultural lands, and it improves the classification accuracy 7% for AdaTree. WL and 6% for SVM.

AB This paper reports on a new Earth Observation ( EO) research field concerning the potential use of space remote sensing for the assessment of crop damage at the field level. Digital field (cadastral) maps were used in order to overcome the problem of poor field boundary distinction (due to the current spatial resolution, small field size, a hilly landscape and the homogeneity of the area cover) and to estimate damage at field level. The relationship between crop damage estimations made by field observations and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI) data was studied. By transforming the cadastral (field) map into a GRID format containing cells of one metre square (ArcView, Spatial Analyst), it was possible to determine the number of cells overlaying pixels or part of pixels only within the field area and the corresponding mean NDVI value. Various techniques, including Supervised Classification and Regression Models, were applied in order to study the correlation between NDVI values and those estimated by Hellenic Organization of Agricultural Insurance (HOAI) experts. The results appear to be very promising and the HOAI has decided to continue the research using the next generation high-resolution satellites.

AB Early information on crops spatial extent is useful from food security standpoint. Growing number of remote sensing satellites are making it easier to map the crop areas in a rapid and cost-effective way. Grape being an commercial fruit crop of India, it is useful to map the grape areas for acreage estimation and monitor its health continuously to get optimum yield. The main contribution of this paper is mapping areas under export and non-export grapes and their health estimation based on hybrid classification-clustering approach using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Nashik district of Maharashtra, India was chosen as study area which is known to be a famous grape belt. We have used Sentinel-2 image of 31st December 2016 to carry out the classification. Two step classification approach have been followed wherein first step involves classification of grape and non-grape areas using broadband spectral features. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Tasseled Crop Transformation (TCT) components viz. Brightness (BR), Greenness (GR) and Wetness (WT) estimated using Sentinel-2 data and slope estimated from ASTER DEM were used during the first step. We evaluate the performance of classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Result shows RF performs best among all classifiers with overall classification accuracy of 93.57 % on validation dataset. Further, comparison of grape areas estimated using our proposed approach with statistics obtained from district agriculture department shows deviation of only 1.84 % in the total grape area. Second step involves classification of export and non-export grapes. Texture features such as entropy, homogeneity and dissimilarity estimated from red-edge bands (Bands 5,6,7) of sentinel-2 have been fed as an input to the same set of classifiers. Results depict the maximum classification accuracy of 81.82 % using RF classifier. Further, estimated export grape area was compared with district agriculture statistics which shows the deviation of 7.98 %. It is also important to monitor the crop health continuously to get the better yield and returns. We have further carried out the health estimation of non-export grape areas. The objective was to get the clusters of healthy, low stressed and high stressed grape areas. ISODATA clustering has been carried out using the indices such as Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI) and NDVI45, Red-Edge Position (REP) and NDVI. Comparison of clusters with ground truth yield data of 31 fields shows that the fields with high stress have obtained lesser yields than others. We envision to provide health related information to the farmers through our existing mKRISHI platform for entire crop season using proposed approach.

AB Hyperspectral sensors are devices that acquire images over hundreds of spectral bands, thereby enabling the extraction of spectral signatures for objects or materials observed. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been used over a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, forestry, geology, ecological monitoring and disaster monitoring. In this paper, the specific application of hyperspectral remote sensing to agriculture is examined. The technological development of agricultural methods is of critical importance as the world's population is anticipated to continuously rise much beyond the current number of 7 billion. One area upon which hyperspectral sensing can yield considerable impact is that of precision agriculture -the use of observations to optimize the use of resources and management of farming practices. For example, hyperspectral image processing is used in the monitoring of plant diseases, insect pests and invasive plant species; the estimation of crop yield; and the fine classification of crop distributions. This paper also presents a detailed overview of hyperspectral data processing techniques and suggestions for advancing the agricultural applications of hyperspectral technologies in Turkey.

AB With the great agriculture population and limited cropland, it is very important to estimate the output of grain produce in China by remote sensing technology. However, the smallholders of cropland can plant what they like, thus it is difficult to monitor the crop planting proportion with only RS images, even with IKONOS/QUICKBIRD data. In GVG agro-status sampling system, the VIDEO camera connected with a notebook by a video capture card and GPS receive card are integrated into the GIS environment. GVG is fixed on a motor and restore the crop pictures and their GPS data when the car is moving along the country road derived from the linear sampling frame in a plantation division unit. A great many of crop pictures along the sample lines are obtained on the field in a limited time, and then all pictures with geographical data are interpreted to calculate the ratio of each type of crop plantation. The crop proportion of plantation division unit is estimated by all pictures' plantation ratio of sample line due to this unit. This literature review has demonstrated the GVG systems hardware's constitute, working principle and the case studies. GVG agrostatus sampling system not only can be acquire every crop's planting proportion of large areas in short time, but also can check up the results, which get from remote sensing crop classification.

AB The jujube industry plays a very important role in the agricultural industrial structure of Xinjiang, China. In recent years, the abandonment of jujube fields has gradually emerged. It is critical to inventory the abandoned land soon after it is generated to adjust agricultural production better and prevent the negative impacts from the abandonment (such as outbreaks of diseases, insect pests, and fires). High-resolution multi-temporal satellite remote sensing images can be used to identify subtle differences among crops and provide a good tool for solving this problem. In this research, both field-based and pixel-based classification approaches using field boundaries were used to estimate the percentage of abandoned jujube fields with multi-temporal high spatial resolution satellite images (Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-6) and the Random Forest algorithm. The results showed that both approaches produced good classification results and similar distributions of abandoned fields. The overall accuracy was 91.1% for the field-based classification and 90.0% for the pixel-based classification, and the Kappa was 0.866 and 0.848 for the respective classifications. The areas of abandoned land detected in the field-based and pixel-based classification maps were 806.09 ha and 828.21 ha, respectively, accounting for 8.97% and 9.11% of the study area. In addition, feature importance evaluations of the two approaches showed that the overall importance of texture features was higher than that of vegetation indices and that 31 October and 10 November were important dates for abandoned land detection. The methodology proposed in this study will be useful for identifying abandoned jujube fields and have the potential for large-scale application.

AB Monitoring biomass over large geographic regions for changes in vegetation and cropping patterns is important for many applications. Changes in vegetation happen due to reasons ranging from climate change and damages to new government policies and regulations. Remote sensing imagery (multi-spectral and multi-temporal) is widely used in change pattern mapping studies. Existing bi-temporal change detection techniques are better suited for multi-spectral images and time series based techniques are more suited for analyzing multi-temporal images. A key contribution of this work is to define change as hierarchical rather than boolean. Based on this definition of change pattern, we developed a novel time series similarity based change detection framework for identifying inter-annual changes by exploiting phenological properties of growing crops from satellite time series imagery. The proposed framework consists of three components: hierarchical clustering tree construction, nearest neighbor based classification, and change detection using similarity Though the proposed approach is unsupervised, we present evaluation using manually induced change regions embedded in the real dataset. We compare our method with the widely used K-Means clustering and evaluation shows that K-Means over-detects changes in comparison to our proposed method.

AB Crop type mapping currently represents an important problem in remote sensing. Accurate information on the extent and types of crops derived from remote sensing can help managing and improving agriculture especially for developing countries where such information is scarce. In this paper, high-resolution RGB drone images are the input data for the classification performed using a transfer learning (TL) approach. VGG16 and GoogLeNet, which are pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for classification tasks coming from computer vision, are considered for the mapping of the crop types. Thanks to the transferred knowledge, the proposed models can successfully classify the studied crop types with high overall accuracy for two considered cases, achieving up to almost 83% for the Malawi dataset and up to 90% for the Mozambique dataset. Notably, these results are comparable to the ones achieved by the same deep CNN architectures in many computer vision tasks. With regard to drone data analysis, application of deep CNN is very limited so far due to high requirements on the number of samples needed to train such complicated architectures. Our results demonstrate that the transfer learning is an efficient way to overcome this problem and take full advantage of the benefits of deep CNN architectures for drone-based crop type mapping. Moreover, based on experiments with different TL approaches we show that the number of frozen layers is an important parameter of TL and a fine-tuning of all the CNN weights results in significantly better performance than the approaches that apply fine-tuning only on some numbers of last layers.

AB In the literature of hyperspectral remote sensing to assess nutrient status in crops, there is a general lack of studies conducted under greenhouse conditions. This may be attributed to technical issues associated with inconsistent lighting conditions during daytime data acquisitions due to shadows and spectral scattering inside greenhouse structures. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed a novel night-based hyperspectral remote sensing system with attached halogen lighting to study leaf reflectance of bok choy [Brassica rapa L. var Chinensis] and spinach [Spinacia oleracea L. 'Correnta"] grown under high, medium and low fertilization regimes. The study objectives were to: 1) identify spectral regions in which average leaf reflectance values could be used accurately to characterize crop responses to overall fertilizer regimes, and 2) characterize consistency across crops of associations between crop leaf reflectance and levels of individual macronutrient elements. Our findings were: 1) leaf reflectance could be used to differentiate low versus medium/high fertilization regimes with 75% (bok choy) and 80% (spinach) accuracy, and 2) the following spectral regions: 700-709 nm, 780-787 nm and 817-821 nm were associated with N, K, Mg and Ca levels in bok choy and spinach. Based on comprehensive sensitivity analysis, we demonstrated that classification accuracy was highly similar when 50-80% of the crop reflectance data were used as training data, indicating robustness of the proposed linear discriminant classification models. We believe the proposed sensitivity analysis has broad relevance as a method to thoroughly examine the robustness of reflectance-based algorithms that are used to classify agricultural products.

AB Agricultural monitoring is an important and continuously spreading activity in remote sensing and applied Earth observations. It supplies valuable information on crop condition and growth processes. Much research has been carried out on vegetation phenology issues. In agriculture, the timing of seasonal cycles of crop activity is important for species classification and evaluation of crop development, growing conditions and potential yield. The correct interpretation of remotely sensed data, however, and the increasing demand for data reliability require ground-truth knowledge of the seasonal spectral behaviuor of different species and their relation to crop vigour. For this reason, we performed ground-based study of the seasonal response of winter wheat reflectance patterns to crop growth patterns. The goal was to quantify crop seasonality by establishing empirical relationships between plant biophysical and spectral properties in main ontogenetic periods. Phenology and agr-specific relationships allow to assess crop condition during different portions of the growth cycle and thus effectively track plant development and make yield predictions. The applicability of different vegetation indices for monitoring crop seasonal dynamics, health condition, and yield potential was examined.

AB Problem of remote sensing data harnessing for decision making in conflict territories is considered. Approach for analysis of socio-economic and demographic parameters with a limited set of data and deep uncertainty is described. Number of interlinked techniques to estimate a population and economy in crisis territories are proposed. Stochastic method to assessment of population dynamics using multi-source data using remote sensing data is proposed. Adaptive Markov's chain based method to study of land-use changes using satellite data is proposed. Proposed approach is applied to analysis of socio-economic situation in Donbas (East Ukraine) territory of conflict in 2014-2015. Land-use and land-cover patterns for different periods were analyzed using the Landsat and MODIS data. The land-use classification scheme includes the following categories: (1) urban or built-up land, (2) barren land, (3) cropland, (4) horticulture farms, (5) livestock farms, (6) forest, and (7) water. It was demonstrated, that during the period 2014-2015 was not detected drastic changes in land-use structure of study area. Heterogeneously distributed decreasing of horticulture farms (4-6%), livestock farms (5-6%), croplands (3-4%), and increasing of barren land (6-7%) have been observed. Way to analyze land-cover productivity variations using satellite data is proposed. Algorithm is based on analysis of time-series of NDVI and NDWI distributions. Drastic changes of crop area and its productivity were detected. Set of indirect indicators, such as night light intensity, is also considered. Using the approach proposed, using the data utilized, the local and regional GDP, local population, and its dynamics are estimated.

AB Crop mapping is one major component of agricultural resource monitoring using remote sensing. Yield or water demand modeling requires that both, the total surface that is cultivated and the accurate distribution of crops, respectively is known. Map quality is crucial and influences the model outputs. Although the use of multi-spectral time series data in crop mapping has been acknowledged, the potentially high dimensionality of the input data remains an issue. In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3%, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection. Uncertainty measures from SVM are an informative source of information on the spatial distribution of error in the crop maps.

AB Crop production estimation is of crucial concern in Taiwan, and the government has invested much effort including employing manpower and technologies. Artificial intelligence or data mining technology have been successfully applied on land-cover recognition of remote-sensing imagery. Most studies are employing a pixel-based classification approach to generate the thematic map of land covers. Few studies consider the spatial correlation of adjacent pixels of the same category. Mixed pixel issues usually degrade the prediction accuracy according to previous studies. It is thus the main goal of the present study to explore the spatial effect of adjacent pixels on land-cover mapping. The study region is a WorldView-2 satellite image in Jianan Plain, Taiwan, taken in 2014. Support Vector Machine is used as the underlying classifier. In addition to the eight spectral band intensities, normalized difference vegetation index and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures are included as ancillary attributes. Furthermore, grey relational analysis (GRA) is employed to assist in classifying croplands. The findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) GLCM texture information improves classification accuracy marginally and renders slightly better thematic map, (2) GRA is used to acquire the most important factors concerning discriminating land covers, (3) grey relational grade threshold, a metric designed through GRA, can be used to locate uncertain region of a specified crop, which is possibly caused by mixed pixels.

AB Traditional means of on-farm weed control mostly relies on manual labor. This process is time consuming, costly and contributes to major yield losses. The conventional application of chemical weed control, however, goes against the strive for sustainability. To solve this using computer vision, precision agriculture researchers have used remote sensing weed maps, but this has been largely ineffective for early season weed control due to problems such as solar reflectance and cloud cover in satellite imagery. With the current advances in artificial intelligence, this study leverages the automatic feature extraction capabilities of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to classify plant seedlings. In a comparative study, we demonstrate that DCNNs can successfully classify crops and weeds in various phenological growth stages. Our results indicate that while training DCNNs from scratch can achieve state-of-the-art performance for weed classification tasks, model performance can be improved by fine-tuning a pre-trained model.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB The groundnut, also known as peanut, is a legume crop that is classified as both a grain legume and an oil crop (due to its high oil content). About 85% of the total groundnut in India is sown in the kharif season under rainfed conditions. This makes it extremely difficult to apply the optical remote sensing methodologies for groundnut discrimination and acreage estimation. We develop a remote sensing strategy based on timeseries synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which is immune to the rainy conditions of the observation period. Further, our work is distinct from the traditional multitemporal SAR backscatter analysis as it incorporates polarimetric parameters such as the alpha angle (a) and the polarimetric radar vegetation index to aid discrimination. These parameters were shortlisted on the basis of maximal sensitivity to groundnut growth stages. Random forest classifier, an ensemble learning-based classifier, is used to carryout the crop classification using these parameters. This approach is contrasted with SAR backscatter-based analysis (using the same RF classifier) and with a Euclidean distance (ED)-based model matching method (with the same polarimetric parameters). A detailed comparative analysis of classification accuracy of groundnut discrimination is carried out using extensive ground truth data over the agricultural fields of Junagadh district in the Gujarat state of Western India. The backscatter-based analysis with RF achieves 86.2% overall accuracy in discriminating groundnut (with the competing cotton crop), whereas polarimetric parameters with ED model matching achieves 76%. Using the proposed method, with dual-pol parameters derived out of Sentinel-1 SAR data, we report 92.7% overall accuracy with a kappa coefficient of 0.81. The major insight is that combining timeseries polarimetric information together with a good machine learning classifier improves the classification accuracy of short crops compared to nonpolarimetric approach.

AB To improve the application ability of the low resolution remote sensing image in crop area remote sensing monitoring, the corn of Jilin province is selected as the object of study. Based on the remote sensing zoning of corn planting area in the research area, and based on middle and low resolution remote sensing data, the corn area mixed-pixel decomposition model based on neural network function is constructed by using Levenberg-Marquard network optimization algorithms and by taking the smallest root-mean-square error as the condition of iteration termination. The input of the model is the EOS-MODIS NDVI time series data of 18 ten-days during the corn growing season from April to September of 2011, with the spatial resolution of 250m; the output is the corn area value of corresponding resolution. The endmember of corn area comes from the maximum likelihood classification result of the SPOT4 image, with the spatial resolution of 20m. Comparing the decomposition results of mixed pixels from the 3 counties of Dehui district with the the results of the background investigation made in 2011, the precision reached 86.1%. The paper attempts to use high resolution images to directly extract crop endmember. Compared with the endmember extraction methods such as Maximum Noise Fraction (MNF), Pixel Purity Index, Principal Component Analysis, and convex cone geometry theory, etc, it has more intuitive effect, more definite physical significance, stronger operability, and larger business operation potential.

AB Due to different combinations of agriculture, livestock and forestry managed by rotation, succession and intercropping practices, integrated agriculture production systems such as integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL) constitute a very complex target and a challenge for automatic mapping of cropping practices based on remote sensing data. The overall objective of this study was to develop a classification strategy for the annual mapping of integrated Crop-Livestock systems (iCL) at a regional scale. This strategy was designed and tested in the six agro-climatic regions of Mato Grosso, the largest Brazilian soybean producer state, using MODIS satellite time-series images acquired between 2012 and 2019, ground data with heterogeneous distribution in space and time and a Random Forest classifier. The results showed that: 1. the use of unbalanced training samples with a class composition close to the real one was the right classifier training strategy; 2. the use of a single training database (pooling samples from different years and regions) to classify each region and year individually proved to be robust enough to provide similar classification accuracies in comparison to those based on the use of a database acquired for each region and for each year. The final hierarchical classification overall accuracy was 0.89 for Level 1, the cropping pattern level (single and double crops DC); 0.84 for Level 2, the DC category level (integrated system iCL soy-pasture/brachiaria, soy-cotton and soy-cereal); 0.77 for Level 3, the iCL level (iCL1 soy-pasture and iCL2 soy-pasture mixed with corn). The F-scores for DC, iCL and iCL1 cropping systems presented high accuracy (0.89, 0.85 and 0.84), while iCL2 was more difficult to classify (0.63). This approach will next be applied across the entire Brazilian soybean corridor, leading to an operational tool for monitoring the adoption of sustainable intensification practices recognized by Brazil's Agriculture Low Carbon Plan (ABC PLAN).

AB The aim of this study was to determine landscape pattern in 19464 ( ha) in the north of the western Andes mountain (Antioquia, Colombia), with presence of natural vegetation, pastures and crops. We used remote sensing tools and analysis from an SPOT XS satellite image from 2001. The analysis was to make with a supervised classification with eight categories: Forest, shade coffee, coffee, height regrowth, pastures, clouds, shade clouds and urban. The landscape patterns were quantified by considering parameters of shape, composition and configuration; as well the structural connectivity of the forest fragments based in landscape metrics used for study the fragmentations. In general it was observed that the landscape present height heterogeneity due to the number of patches (849 in natural coverage). The forest and height regrowth has 214 and 251 patches respectively, with smalls sizes and very distant. The dominant covers are the pastures and shade coffee, those present the biggest patches and are the most continuous.

AB This paper presents a study on a new problem: applying machine learning approaches to translate remote sensing images between high-resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. To this end, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been explored. Efficiency of the conditional GAN have been verified with different SAR parameters on three regions from the world: Toronto, Vancouver in Canada and Shanghai in China. The generated SAR images have been evaluated by pixel-based image classification with detailed land cover types including: low and high density residential area, industry area, construction site, golf course, water, forest, pasture and crops. In comparison with an unsupervised GAN translation approach, the proposed conditional GAN could effectively keep many land cover types with compatible classification accuracy to the ground truth SAR data. This is one of first study on multi-source remote sensing data translation by machine learning.

AB The accurate acquisition of the grain crop planting area is a necessary condition for realizing precision agriculture. UAV remote sensing has the advantages of low cost use, simple operation, real-time acquisition of remote sensor images and high ground resolution. It is difficult to separate cultivated land from other terrain by using only a single feature, making it necessary to extract cultivated land by combining various features and hierarchical classification. In this study, the UAV platform was used to collect visible light remote sensing images of farmland to monitor and extract the area information, shape information and position information of farmland. Based on the vegetation index, texture information and shape information in the visible light band, the object-oriented method was used to study the best scheme for extracting cultivated land area. After repeated experiments, it has been determined that the segmentation scale 50 and the consolidation scale 90 are the most suitable segmentation parameters. Uncultivated crops and other features are separated by using the band information and texture information. The overall accuracy of this method is 86.40% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.80. The experimental results show that the UAV visible light remote sensing data can be used to classify and extract cultivated land with high precision. However, there are some cases where the finely divided plots are misleading, so further optimization and improvement are needed.

TI Mapping Cropping Practices Using MODIS Time Series: Harnessing the Data

DE Time series; MODIS; Remote sensing; EVI
ID NDVI DATA
AB The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 250m EVI dataset provides a valuable ongoing means of characterising and monitoring changes in land use and resource condition. However the multiple factors that influence a time series of greenness data make the data difficult to analyse and interpret. Without prior knowledge, underlying models for time series in a given remote sensing image are often heterogeneous. So while conventional time series analysis methods such as wavelet transform and Fourier analysis may work well for part of the image, these models are either invalid or must be substantially re-parameterised for other parts of the image. To overcome these challenges we propose a new approach to distil information from earth observation time series data. The characteristics of a remote sensing time series are represented by a set of statistics (which we call coefficients) selected to correspond to the dynamics of a natural system. To ensure the coefficients are robust and generic, statistics are calculated independently by applying statistical models with less complexity on shorter segments within the time series. An International Standards Organization (ISO) Land Cover classification (Jansen 2000) was generated for cropping regions in the Gwydir and Namoi catchments, in Australia. Areas identified in the classification as irrigated and rain fed cropping were analysed using a tailored time series analysis tool. The crop analysis tool identifies time series features such as the number and duration of fallow periods, crop timing, presence/absence of a crop during a year for a specific growing season. This information is combined with paddock boundaries derived from Landsat imagery to provide detailed year-by-year insight into cropping practices in the Gwydir and Namoi catchments.

AB Rice is the most important cereal crop governing food security in Asia. Reliable and regular information on the area under rice production is the basis of policy decisions related to imports, exports and prices which directly affect food security. Recent and planned launches of SAR sensors coupled with automated processing can provide sustainable solutions to the challenges on mapping and monitoring rice systems. High resolution (3m) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries were used to map and monitor rice growing areas in selected three sites in TamilNadu, India to determine rice cropping extent, track rice growth and estimate yields. A simple, robust, rule-based classification for mapping rice area with multi-temporal, X-band, HH polarized SAR imagery from COSMO Skymed and TerraSAR X and site specific parameters were used. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated on a very large dataset involving 30 images across 3 footprints obtained during 2013-14. A total of 318 in-season site visits were conducted across 60 monitoring locations for rice classification and 432 field observations were made for accuracy assessment. Rice area and Start of Season (SoS) maps were generated with classification accuracies ranging from 87-92 per cent. Using ORYZA2000, a weather driven process based crop growth simulation model; yield estimates were made with the inclusion of rice crop parameters derived from the remote sensing products viz., seasonal rice area, SoS and backscatter time series. Yield Simulation accuracy levels of 87 per cent at district level and 85-96 per cent at block level demonstrated the suitability of remote sensing products for policy decisions ensuring food security and reducing vulnerability of farmers in India.

AB Crop distribution information is essential for tackling some challenges associated with providing food for a growing global population. This information has been successfully compiled using the Multi-Data Approach (MDA). However, the current implementation of the approach is based on optical remote sensing, which fails to deliver the relevant information under cloudy conditions. We therefore extend the MDA by using Land Use/Land Cover classifications derived from six multitemporal and dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X stripmap images, which do not require cloud-free conditions. These classifications were then combined with auxiliary, official geodata (ATKIS and Physical Blocks (PB)) data to lower misclassification and provide an enhanced LULC map that includes further information about the annual crop classification. These final classifications showed an overall accuracy (OA) of 75% for seven crop-classes (maize, sugar beet, barley, wheat, rye, rapeseed, and potato). For potatoes, however, classification does not appear to be as consistently accurate, as could be shown from repeated comparisons with variations of training and validation fields. When the rye, wheat, and barley classes were merged into a winter cereals class, the resultant five crop-class classifications had a high OA of about 90%.

AB Crop classification is a key issue for agricultural monitoring using remote-sensing techniques. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are attractive for crop classification because of their all-weather, all-day imaging capability. The objective of this study is to investigate the capability of SAR data for crop classification in the North China Plain. Multi-temporal Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) and TerraSAR data were acquired. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was selected for the classification using different combinations of these SAR data and texture features. The results indicated that multi-configuration SAR data achieved satisfactory classification accuracy (best overall accuracy of 91.83%) in the North China Plain. ASAR performed slightly better than TerraSAR data acquired in the same time span for crop classification, while the combination of two frequencies of SAR data (C- and X-band) was better than the multi-temporal C-band data. Two temporal ASAR data acquired in late jointing and flowering periods achieved sufficient classification accuracy, and adding data to the early jointing period had little effect on improving classification accuracy. In addition, texture features of SAR data were also useful for improving classification accuracy. SAR data have considerable potential for agricultural monitoring and can become a suitable complementary data source to optical data.

DE Auto-encoder; Spatio-temporal data; Cropland mapping
AB Automated cropland monitoring can offer timely and reliable agricultural information, which is critical to meet the increasing demand for food supply and food security. In most cropland mapping tasks, domain researchers provide manually labeled training samples for several major crop types and request for identifying these major crops in a target region. However, it is very expensive to hire experts to label all the other land covers that exist in the target region. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to identify major crops without using labeled training samples for other land covers. For each major crop type, we train a one-class classification model based on sparse-autoencoder (SAE). Specifically, we utilize the high-resolution (similar to 10m) remote sensing data as input features to classify each location either as one of major crop types or as other land covers.
   Many crop types are similar to each other in most dates of a year, but are distinguishable only during a short period in growing season. To better model the seasonal patterns of different crop types and to capture the their discriminative periods, we introduce a sliding window to cover different growing periods in a year and learn separate SAEs from these periods. Moreover, since remote sensing data are commonly disturbed by natural noise factors, we explore the spatial contiguity of unlabeled data in test region and incorporate it as a constraint in training process to further improve the performance. In this way, we utilize both labeled data and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised method to jointly train SAE. Finally, we design a mechanism to combine the SAEs trained for different crop types to make final classification decisions. We extensively evaluate the proposed method in mapping several major crops in Minnesota, US. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately map the extent of major crops, and capture the temporal growing patterns of different crops. Besides, the results confirm the effectiveness of spatial constraint in mitigating noise factors and making spatially contiguous classification. In addition, we give illustrative examples to show that the proposed method can help detect errors in existing cropland mapping product.

AB During the key growth period of kharif dry-land crops in the north of China, due to the big impact of cloudy or rainy weather, it's impossible to acquire optical remote sensing data in a timely and efficient manner. Therefore, it's very necessary to use radar remote sensing to identify kharif dry-land crops. With Shenzhou City of Hubei Province as the study area, this paper has selected 6 sessions of Radarsat-2 fully polarimetric images which cover the area from June 3rd to Oct 1st in 2014 as the data source. Through the analysis of the backward-scattering characteristic of various ground objects, we found that cross-polarization channels had a better performance than like-polarization in identifying dry-land crops. Also, we put forward the optimum polarization and phase for identifying dry-land crops with the support vector machine (SVM) classification accuracy and Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance as the standard. We conducted identification of 5 major ground objects in the study area with the decision tree classifier (DTC) and the SVM method. The result suggests that radar data can be effectively applied in identifying dry-land crops, SVM is superior to DTC in identifying dry-land crops and SVM has a distinct advantage in identifying small areas and controlling speckle noise.

AB Planning and strategies of government subsidized programs for agriculture require accurate information about extents and classification of arable land for crop production. In Mexico 20% of arable land is on slopes and ravines, and cultivated extents vary from one agricultural cycle to the next one due to local practices and other factors. There is a problem posed for government decision makers to obtain accurate estimations of cultivated extents and arable land on a yearly basis. Surface values provided by photographic interpretations or by the producers themselves are inaccurate estimations. To increase accuracy a topographical survey of each parcel and current field data would be required for each agricultural cycle, a practical impossibility. Remote sensing (RS) technologies offer an alternative to timely estimate surfaces for decision making at different scales - local, regional or higher - to support planning and management of government programs. In some places RS based methodologies already provide information about seeded crops, advance estimated yields and accurate arable surfaces. These methodologies are well adapted to relatively flat and large areas. Sloped surface estimation directly from an optical satellite image introduces inaccuracies since the calculated values correspond to a planar view of the terrain. An adjustment method to control slope effects based on regression estimates and adjustment factors according to a slope classification is proposed. This work reports on a pilot study realized on an area located in Central Mexico which covers approximately 25 km(2). Plots with slope intervals of 0-9%; 9.1-19%; 19.1-29%; 29.1-39% and > 39%, which were classified as simple or complex were considered. The plot areas were calculated by triangulation from polar coordinates using one or several points within each polygon on the images. The accuracy of the measurements was verified with topographical instruments on the field. Comparisons were made between remote sensing results and from field surveying data. The study concludes on the advantages and applicability of the method using images from SPOT and Ikonos sensors.

AB This study aimed to apply remote sensing technologies in delineating sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) plantations and in identifying its growth stages. Considering the growing demand for sugarcane in the local and global markets, the need for a science-based resource inventory emerges. In this sense, remote sensing techniques' unique ability is vital to monitor crop growth and estimate crop yield. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) concept was employed by utilizing orthophotos and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) datasets. Specifically, the study applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to generate the resource map, validated by a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). The classification result showed an accuracy of 98.4%, delineating a total of 13.93 hectares of sugarcane plantation in the study area. The height information from LiDAR datasets aided in developing the rule-set that can further classify the sugarcane according to its growth stages. Results showed that the area distribution of sugarcane at establishment, tillering, yield formation, and ripening stage were 6.65%, 11.61%, 13.89%, and 17.90% respectively. GPS validation points of the growth stages verified the accuracy of SVM. The accuracy results for growth stages, i.e. establishment, tillering, yield formation, and ripening are 88%, 94.4%, 96.3%, and 91.7% respectively. The results proved the usefulness of SVM as a remote sensing classification technique which led to an exact mapping of the sugarcane areas as well as the practical use of LiDAR height information in estimating the growth stages of the mapped resource, both of which can provide valuable aid in estimating the potential sugarcane yield in the future.

AB The availability of spatially explicit information about agricultural crops for large regions in Argentina is scarce. In particular, due to temporal dynamics of agricultural production (i.e. changes in planted crops from year to year) and spectral similarities among herbaceous crops it is difficult to generate crop type maps from remote sensing. Large regions with marked climatic variations, like the main agricultural areas of Argentina, represent an additional challenge. Here we generated a map based on supervised classifications using field samples along 14 agricultural zones. Best classification accuracies were obtained by combining seasonal indices (year, summer and winter), with indices that describe the temporal dynamics of vegetation. Accuracy was increased at regions with high and balanced number of samples and with longer growing seasons. The map allows to identify areas with clusters of one, two or three crops and to characterize areas with different spatial distribution between cropland and no cropland areas.

AB The agricultural frontier expansion in the Cerrado biome made Brazil a leader in commodity exports and is changing its landscape. Hence, efforts to accurate land use and land cover (LULC) monitoring in this region are strategic, due to its role in Brazil's food, environmental, and economic security policy. Thinking on planning and technical sovereignty in the spatial sector, the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) Program was launched to provide useful data for decision-makers to manage the Brazilian territory independently of external policies. Their data, especially from CBERS-4 Wide-Field Imager (CBERS-4/WFI), are largely applied in deforestation monitoring by remote sensing specialists but less applied than data from other image providers for machine learning-based LULC mapping due to the small number of spectral bands and limitations related to clouds and shadows detection. However, with advances in orbital data analysis, data cubes enabled storing and accessing large spatio-temporal analysis-ready data. Within this scope, the Brazil Data Cube Project (BDC) creates multidimensional data cubes from orbital sensors' data for all Brazilian territory. We applied BDC CBERS-4/WFI data cubes to generate LULC classifications for the Extremo Oeste Baiano agricultural belt correspondent to the 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 harvest periods, at two levels of detail: broad and crop type, incorporating ground truth samples, crop calendar knowledge, and vegetation indices to a dense time series analysis approach. Overall Accuracies were equal to 0.87 and 0.89 for broad, and 0.91 and 0.94 for crop type classifications. The results indicate CBERS-4/WFI data cubes as a useful tool for improving crop monitoring in the Cerrado biome based on machine learning.

AB The generation of land-cover maps for agriculture is a recurrent problem in remote sensing. There exist many efficient algorithms, but they often need well selected images during specific periods, which delays the map availability to the end of the season. In this work, we propose to introduce prior knowledge about the crop rotation in order to both improve the classification and obtain an accurate map early in the year. We use a Bayesian Network to model the crop rotation and we introduce the output of the model into a Support Vector Machine classifier to generate a land-cover map. We evaluate the overall improvement and the effect on several crops.

AB Accurate estimation of crop yields is crucial for ensuring food security. However, crops are distributed so fragmentally in China that mixed pixels account for a large proportion in moderate and coarse resolution remote sensing images. As a result, unmixing of mixed pixel becomes a major problem to estimate crop yield by means of remote sensing method. Aimed at mixed pixels, we developed a new method to introduce additional information contained in the spatial scaling transformation equation to the canopy reflectance model. The crop area and LAI can be retrieved simultaneously. On the basis of a precise and simple canopy reflectance model, directional second derivative method was chosen to retrieve LAI from optimal bands of hyper-spectral data; this method can reduce the impact of the canopy non-isotropic features and soil background. To evaluate the performance of the method, Yingke Oasis, Zhangye City, Gansu Province, was chosen as the validation area. This area was covered mainly by maize and wheat. A Hyperion/EO-1 image with the 30 m spatial resolution was acquired on July 15, 2008. Images of 180 m and 1080 m resolutions were generated by linearly interpolating the original Hyperion image to coarser resolutions. Then a multi-scale image serial was obtained. Using the proposed method, we calculated crop area and the average LAI of every 1080 m pixel. A SPOT-5 classification figure serves as the validation data of crop area proportion. Results show that the pattern of crop distribution accords with the classification figure. The errors are restrained mainly to -0.1-0.1, and approximate a Normal Distribution. Meanwhile, 85 LAI values obtained using LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer, equipped with GPS, were taken as the ground reference. Results show that the standard deviation of the errors is 0.340. The method proposed in the paper is reliable.

AB The green depressing cropping system (GDCS) has existed in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China (FPENC) for hundreds of years. This ancient practice aims to promote an agricultural system that is both green and sustainable at the same time. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the extent and implementation of the GDCS in China. Here we present a study that analyses GDCS fields and their related farmland use patterns in Ulanqab, China. This study takes into consideration satellite imagery, ground truth data, phenological records, and other ancillary data from 2015 to 2019 at the Ulanqab region. The integration of the former datasets, combined with visual interpretation and a random forest classification approach, successfully mapped the distribution of GDCS fields, GDCS frequencies, GDCS-crop rotation, and the determinants (terrain, irrigation) of the distribution of the GDCS practice. Our results suggest that GDCS is still prevailing and relatively widespread in Ulanqab, especially in the Houshan area, where a total of 10.29% of farmlands in the study region have adopted the practice. Cereal crops, potato, and other drought-resistant crops were the preferred previous and subsequent crops of GDCS, rather than maize and sunflowers. According to our results, 91.5% of the GDCS fields were rainfed in Ulanqab, suggesting that the practice is associated with dry farming. We also found that the practice is particularly prevalent in the fields with a steeper slope. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the importance of remote sensing towards the implementation of pilot programs that involve crop rotation and fallow systems.

AB Land cover is a crucial, spatially and temporally varying component of global carbon and climate systems. Therefore accurate estimation and monitoring of land cover changes is important in global change research. Although, land cover has dramatically changed over the last few centuries, until now there has been no consistent way of quantifying the changes globally.
   In this study we used long-term climate, soils data along with coarse resolution satellite observations to quantify the magnitude and spatial extent of global land cover changes due to anthropogenic processes. Differences between potential leaf area index, derived from climate-soil-leaf area equilibrium and actual leaf area index obtained from satellite data were used to estimate changes in land cover.
   Forest clearing for agriculture and irrigated farming in arid and semi-arid lands are found to be two major sources of climatically important land cover changes. Satellite derived Spectral Vegetation indices (SVI) and surface temperatures (Ts) show strong impact of land cover changes on climatic processes. Irrigated agriculture in dry areas increased energy absorption and evapotranspiration (ET) compared to natural vegetation. On the other hand, forest clearing for crops decreased energy absorption and ET.
   A land cover classification and monitoring system is proposed using satellite derived SVI and Ts that simultaneously characterize energy absorption and exchange processes. This completely remote sensing based approach is useful for monitoring land cover changes as well as their impacts on climate. Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover is possible with current operational satellites, and could be substantially improved with the Earth Observing System (EOS) era satellite sensors.

AB Understanding the use of current land cover, along with monitoring change over time, is vital for agronomists and agricultural agencies responsible for land management. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost. The overall accuracy achieved by our proposed Pixel R-CNN was 96.5%, which showed considerable improvements in comparison with existing mainstream methods. This study showed that Pixel R-CNN based model offers a highly accurate way to assess and employ time-series data for multi-temporal classification tasks.

AB Monitoring of the forest area has gained recognition in the worldwide scenario due to the understanding of its role in carbon appropriation and global warming. Gautala Autramghat is a protected area of the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state, India. It is situated in the Satmala and Ajantha hill ranges of the Western Ghats; it is administrated by Aurangabad and Jalgaon District. The wildlife sanctuary was established in an existing reserved forest area in 1986. The area is a southern tropical dry deciduous forest with scattered bush and grasslands. India, being a mega-biodiversity country, supports diverse forest vegetation of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate types. The remote-sensing techniques are employed to map the forest cover. IRS RS2 LISS III sensor data are used to generate a medium-scale vegetation cover map. One scene of 01-Feb-2015 with minimum cloud cover was acquired, preprocessed, and georeferenced to Survey of India toposheets. The satellite image was then subjected to the Maximum Likelihood Classification, assuming six types of objects, namely Open Forest, Moderate Dense Forest, Shrubs Forest, Barren Land, Crop, and Water. A standard forest vegetation cover classification legend was used for this purpose. The vegetation classes were visited on ground to collect information on their structure and composition, which was utilized in the classification exercise.

AB Agricultural management increasingly uses crop maps based on classification of remotely sensed data. However, classification errors can translate to errors in model outputs, for instance agricultural production monitoring (yield, water demand) or crop acreage calculation. Hence, knowledge on the spatial variability of the classier performance is important information for the user. But this is not provided by traditional assessments of accuracy, which are based on the confusion matrix. In this study, classification uncertainty was analyzed, based on the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. SVM was applied to multi-spectral time series data of RapidEye from different agricultural landscapes and years. Entropy was calculated as a measure of classification uncertainty, based on the per-object class membership estimations from the SVM algorithm. Permuting all possible combinations of available images allowed investigating the impact of the image acquisition frequency and timing, respectively, on the classification uncertainty. Results show that multi-temporal datasets decrease classification uncertainty for different crops compared to single data sets, but there was no "one-image-combination-fits-all" solution. The number and acquisition timing of the images, for which a decrease in uncertainty could be realized, proved to be specific to a given landscape, and for each crop they differed across different landscapes. For some crops, an increase of uncertainty was observed when increasing the quantity of images, even if classification accuracy was improved. Random forest regression was employed to investigate the impact of different explanatory variables on the observed spatial pattern of classification uncertainty. It was strongly influenced by factors related with the agricultural management and training sample density. Lower uncertainties were revealed for fields close to rivers or irrigation canals. This study demonstrates that classification uncertainty estimates by the SVM algorithm provide a valuable addition to traditional accuracy assessments. This allows analyzing spatial variations of the classifier performance in maps and also differences in classification uncertainty within the growing season and between crop types, respectively.

AB Opium is a narcotic obtained from opium poppy and is the raw material of heroin for the illegal drug trade. Monitoring the illegal concentrated cultivation of opium poppy in major regions is critical for the understanding by governments and international communities of the scale of illegal drug trade. This paper investigates whether opium poppy can be discriminated from its coexisting plants using analytical-spectral-device field spectrometer data in the visible to short-wave infrared spectral range. Canopy spectral measurements were conducted during three different growth periods of opium poppy. A synthetic method with three analysis levels was applied to discriminate opium poppy from other species and to select optimal bands for opium poppy discrimination. First, the Mann-Whitney U-test method was used to test the spectral reflectance difference between opium poppy and coexisting crops at each wavelength. Then, the Jeffries-Matusita distance and band correlation analysis were conducted to select the optimal wavebands for discriminating opium poppy using the significant wavebands from the test results. Finally, classification and regression tree analysis was employed to validate the classification accuracy based on the selected optimal wavebands. The results indicated that the spectral reflectance of opium poppy was significantly different from that of coexisting crops in many surveyed wavebands, and opium poppy could be discriminated using a field survey spectrum at canopy level. The best time for discriminating opium poppy from coexisting crops was around flowering time. This paper provided the prerequisite for monitoring opium poppy using satellite remote sensing data in some regions of concern.

AB Driven by significant technological developments in the hyperspectral imaging, material mapping using reference spectra has received renewed interest of the remote sensing community. The applicability of reference spectral signatures in image classification depends mainly on the material type and its spectral signature behaviour. Identification and spectral characterization of materials which exhibit unique spectral behaviour is the first step in this approach. Consequently there have been active researches for the identification of surface materials which exhibit unique spectral signatures. The uniqueness of reflectance signature of winter rape relative to its co-occurring crop species was reported in this study. Reflectance spectral libraries constructed from field spectral reflectance measurements collected over five agricultural crops (alfalfa, winter barley, winter rape, winter rye, and winter wheat) during four subsequent growing seasons were classified by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Further, the reference field spectral database was used for the spectral feature fitting and classification of a historical HyMAP airborne hyperspectral imagery acquired at a separate site, by spectral library search. Results indicate the existence of a meaningful spectral matching between image and field spectra for winter rape and demonstrate the potential for transferring spectral library for hyperspectral image classification. The observed consistency in the discrimination of winter rape demonstrates experimentally the fundamental principle of remote sensing which suggests the theoretical existence of unique spectral signatures for materials which can be incorporated as reference spectral signatures for hyperspectral image classification.

AB Remote-sensing satellite images provided rapid and continuous spectral and spatial information of the land surface in the Sougia River catchment by identifying the major changes that have taken place over 20 years (1995-2015). Vegetation indices (VIs) of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and leaf area index were derived for monitoring and mapping variations in vegetation cover. The quantified decrease in NDVI was found to be 4% between 1995 and 2005, and further decreased by 77.1% between 2005 and 2015; it declined back to almost the initial status of 1995. EVI results were inconsistent suggesting that seasonal crops influence the temporal distribution of vegetation cover. The temporal variations in the VIs were important input parameters for the modelling and management of the catchment's hydrological behaviour. Image classification found that the 4- and the 6-class classifications between 1995 and 2005 were unstable and produced, respectively, a 13.8% and 16.2% total change between classes. Meanwhile, the 8-, 10- and the 12-class showed an almost horizontal line with a minor fluctuation of less than 0.05%. The results of the post-classification change detection analysis indicated a land degradation in terms of natural vegetation losses with sparser or even with no natural vegetation cover.

AB This study was performed to develop and apply a land cover classification method in subtropical regions by using multi-temporal satellite images acquired from various satellites in the Todoroki River watershed, Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan (24 degrees 22.6 ' N, 124 degrees 14.5 ' E). Six satellite images, including the winter and summer periods from 2006 to 2008, were used. This data set included data from several satellites: ALOS/AVNIR2, SPOT/HRV, HRG, and FORMOSAT-2. The land cover classification was performed using the decision tree method, considering the crop calendar and the time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from the satellite data. Our method showed better classification accuracy than another traditional method (ISODATA). In addition, the classification result includes dynamics of crop growth patterns. The land cover classification method proposed in the present study can be applied to other tropical and subtropical regions that have similar crops.

AB Crop identification and classification are the basis of fine agricultural development. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been utilized as a cost-efficient approach. Hyperspectral remote sensing data sensing technology has achieved breakthroughs in modern technologies such as long-term dynamic monitoring of crop growth, crop species damage, and acquisition the agricultural information accurately. The novelty of this paper appears in the simulation and prediction of some crops according to wavelength of bands. In the present study, the hyperspectral curves and sensitive bands of 400 samples for four varieties crops (Red medlar or wolfberry, jujube, watermelons and grape) were collected using a hyperspectral instrument. Some multivariate analyses were used for identifying optimal bands, simulation and prediction of different agricultural crops. Principal component analysis (PCA), load coefficient method (LCM), successive projection algorithm (SPA) partial least-squares regression (PLS), and competitive adaptive reweighting sampling (CARS) methods were used to select characteristic wavelengths using Euclidean distance. High value of Euclidean distance was 15.13, 14.095, 16.305 and 14.10 between medlar & jujube, jujube & watermelons, jujube & watermelons and jujube & grape, respectively; it is appears high in CARS among other multivariate analysis. The results show that these characteristic bands can distinguish four kinds of characteristic crops well, but the effect of CARS extraction for selected crops is the best. For prediction of optimal bands, PLS was proven to be the most accurate model of crop prediction, a prediction was developed by applying the CARS-PLS-DA model based on each pixel at the optimal wavelengths. All data and points that selected for wolfberry prediction is very accurate not missing any points for its prediction; on the other hand, foe melon one point of wolfberry appear in the prediction of melon. For Jujube, some points from other crops interface in its prediction; on the other hand grape doesn't miss any points in its prediction. Prediction of selected crops shows that grape and watermelon have the best crops in specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Cross validation and calibration confirm the possibility of hyperspectral imagine for prediction of all crops especially grape and watermelon. Different multivariate analysis proved its ability to identify optimal bands of diffident species of crops under any conditions. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging could be used for crop identification and prediction for effective classification technique.

AB A greenhouse is an important land-use type, which can effectively improve agricultural production conditions and increase crop yields. It is of great significance to obtain the spatial distribution data of greenhouses quickly and accurately for regional agricultural production and food security. Based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and Landsat 8 images, this study selected a total of 18 indicators from three aspects of spectral features, texture features and terrain features to construct greenhouse identification features. From a variety of classification algorithms for remote-sensing recognition of greenhouses, this study selected three classifiers with higher accuracy (classification and regression trees (CART), random forest model (randomForest) and maximum entropy model (gmoMaxEnt)) to construct an integrated classification algorithm, and then extracted the spatial distribution data of greenhouses in Jiangsu Province. The results show that: (1) Google Earth Engine with its own massive data and cloud computing capabilities, combined with integrated classification algorithms, can achieve rapid remote-sensing mapping of large-scale greenhouses under complex terrain, and the classification accuracy is higher than that of a single classification algorithm. (2) The combination of different spectral, texture and terrain features has a greater impact on the extraction of regional greenhouses, the combination of all three aspects of features has the highest accuracy. Spectral features are the key factors for greenhouse remote-sensing mapping, but terrain and texture features can also enhance classification accuracy. (3) The greenhouse in Jiangsu Province has significant spatial differentiation and spatial agglomeration characteristics. The most widely distributed greenhouses are mainly concentrated in the agriculturally developed areas such as Dongtai City, Hai'an County, Rudong County and Pizhou City.

AB There is a global realization in all governmental setups of the need to provoke the efficient appraisal of crop water budgeting in order to manage water resources efficiently. This study aims to use the satellite remote sensing techniques to determine the water deficit in the crop rich Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command area. Crop classification was performed using multi-temporal NDVI profiles of Landsat-8 imagery by distinguishing the crop cycles based on reflectance curves. The reflectance-based crop coefficients (Kc) were derived by linear regression between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) cycles of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defined crop coefficients. A MODIS 250 m NDVI product of the last 10 years (2004-2013) was used to identify the best performing crop cycle using Fourier filter method. The meteorological parameters including rainfall and temperature substantiated the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) calculated using the Hargreaves method. The difference of potential ET and actual ET, derived from the reflectance-based Kc calculated using reference NDVI and current NDVI, generates the water deficit. Results depict the strong correlation between ET, temperature and rainfall, as the regions having maximum temperature resulted in high ET and low rainfall and vice versa. The derived Kc values were observed to be accurate when compared with the crop calendar. Results revealed maximum water deficit at middle stage of the crops, which were observed to be particularly higher at the tail of the canal command. Moreover, results also depicted that kharif (summer) crops suffer higher deficit in comparison to rabi (winter) crops due to higher ET demand caused by higher temperature. Results of the research can be utilized for rational allocation of canal supplies and guiding farmers towards usage of alternate sources to avoid crop water stress.

AB it is necessary to apply a remote sensing-based system for rice cultivation assessment parallel with the field measurements of the crop biophysical parameters. This study aims to map the rice cultivated areas and give an estimate for the expected yield (ton/ha) using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The study was carried out in an experimental site in the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate with a total area of 3240 ha. The multi temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extracted from nine Sentinel-2 imagery cover the whole summer season. The supervised nearest neighborhood object-based classification method was employed, resulting in a classification map with an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. Yield prediction was carried out by using an empirical yield prediction model using the NDVI and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). The LAI was calculated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model and then validated against the measured LAI. the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MPAE) was calculated to estimate the error between the measured and predicted LAI and yield. The MPAE was found to be +/- 6.76% (i.e. +/- 0.28 m(2)/m(2)) with a high correlation between the measured and the calculated LAI with a coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.94). While for the yield, the MPAE was found to be +/- 6.53% (i.e. +/- 0.66 ton/ha) and R-2 of 0.95. This method is applicable to estimate area and yield of rice in the northern Nile delta in adequate time before harvest. (C) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields, which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield. In this study, we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass (AGB) of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash-crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and/or vegetation indices (VIs). Therefore, we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops (forage turnip, white oats, and rye) in the season prior to cash-crop planting. Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models. They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope (PS) constellation of satellites. From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017, we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models. The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones. The cover-crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) and the lowest root mean square (RMSE) in the validation and test datasets were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cubist (CUB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB). For most models and cover crops, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the two most important AGB predictors. At the date of maximum VI at the beginning of the flowering stage, the correlation coefficients (r) between the cover-crop AGB and the cash-crop yield (soybean and maize) ranged from +0.70 for forage turnip to +0.78 for rye. The fuzzy unsupervised classification of the cover-crop AGB estimates delineated two management zones, which were spatially consistent with those obtained from cash-crop yield. The comparison between both maps produced overall accuracies that ranged from 61.20% to 68.25% with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB and cash-crop yield than zone 1 over the three sites. We conclude that satellite AGB estimates of cover crops can be used as a proxy for generating management zone maps in agricultural fields. These maps can be further refined in the field with any other type of method and data, whenever necessary.

AB In the agricultural field, optical remote sensing technology plays an important role in crop monitoring or production estimation. However, the widespread distribution of clouds and rain limits the application of optical remote sensing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used for studies of oceans, atmosphere, land, and space exploration, as well as by the military due to its all-weather nature, penetration to surface and cloud layers, and diversity of information carriers. However, it is difficult to classify ground objects with high accuracy based on SAR data. Considering the features of these two datasets, we proposed a framework to improve crop classifications in cloudy and rainy areas based on the optical-SAR response mechanism. Specifically, this method is designed to train a parametric analytic model in the area using both kinds of datasets and applied in the area with only SAR data to obtain the optical time-series features. Then crops from the second area were classified by the long-short-term memory network. As an example, the parametric analytic model in Lixian County was studied and was applied to Xifeng County to classify the crops with the OA of 61%, which had proved the robustness of the method.

AB The detection of irrigated areas by means of remote sensing is essential to improve agricultural water resource management. Currently, data from the Sentinel constellation offer new possibilities for mapping irrigated areas at the plot scale. Until now, few studies have used Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data to provide approaches for mapping irrigated plots in temperate areas. This study proposes a method for detecting irrigated and rainfed plots in a temperate area (southwestern France) jointly using optical (Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1) and meteorological (SAFRAN) time series, through a classification algorithm. Monthly cumulative indices calculated from these satellite data were used in a Random Forest classifier. Two data years have been used, with different meteorological characteristics, allowing the performance of the method to be analysed under different climatic conditions. The combined use of the whole cumulative data (radar, optical and weather) improves the irrigated crop classifications (Overall Accuary (OA) approximate to 0.7) compared to the classifications obtained using each data separately (OA < 0.5). The use of monthly cumulative rainfall allows a significant improvement of the Fscore of irrigated and rainfed classes. Our study also reveals that the use of cumulative monthly indices leads to performances similar to those of the use of 10-day images while considerably reducing computational resources.

AB An estimation of the crop water requirements for the Pontina Plain, Central Italy, was carried out through the use of remote sensing land classification and application of a simple water balance scheme in a GIS environment. The overall crop water demand for the 700 km(2) area was estimated at about 70 Mm(3) year (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), i.e. 100 Mm(3) year (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) irrigation requirements when considering an average irrigation application efficiency of 70%. The simplest and least demanding available methodology, in terms of data and resources, was chosen. The methodology, based on remote sensing and GIS, employed only 4 Landsat ETM+ images and a few meteorological and geographical vectorial layers. The procedure allowed the elaboration of monthly maps of crop evapotranspiration. The application of a spatially distributed simple water balance model, lead to the estimation of temporal and spatial variation of crop water requirements in the study area. This study contributes to fill a gap in the knowledge on agricultural use of water resources in the area, which is essential for the implementation of a sustainable and sound water policy as required in the region for the application of the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB The problem of identification of single crop fields is a challenge when single date optical remote sensing image is used. The use of temporal images solves this problem. However, issues like cloud cover in optical images influence accuracy of results. Microwave data, which penetrate through the atmosphere, solve this problem. The existence of mixed pixels in satellite images and nonlinearity in image classification is also overlooked. These issues were considered and worked on by integrating C band RISAT-1 with Formosat-2 temporal images and using possibilistic c-means classifier with similarity and dissimilarity norms to identify late transplanted paddy (Oryza sativa) fields in Haridwar District of India. Three datasets in different temporal combinations of microwave and optical images were classified for various similarity and dissimilarity norms for different values of weighted constant. Favorable results were achieved for Manhattan and mean absolute difference norm at weighted constant m = 1.3. Classification of late transplanted paddy for datasets containing multiple RISAT-1 and single Formosat-2 images with transplanting, growth stages was found to yield best results as compared to other combination of temporal images.

AB Detecting and quantifying crop residue cover on agricultural fields is essential in identifying conservation tillage practices and estimating carbon sequestration, both of which are important goals within the Agricultural Policy Framework of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Crop residue is traditionally measured using ground survey techniques such as the line-transect method or visual (drive-by) assessment but these techniques are tedious, time-consuming and subjective. With the increased number of advanced earth observation satellites, remote sensing has now become a viable option for mapping agricultural land management practices and percent crop residue cover. A wide variety of indices such as the Normalized Difference Index (NDI) and the Modified Soil Adjusted Crop Residue Index (MSACRI) were developed using multispectral data for this purpose but results have been mixed. Advanced classification techniques including linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) provide an alternative to derive percent crop residue cover.
   Landsat-7 SLC-Off data were acquired over an agricultural study site in Eastern Ontario on May 25 2005. Simultaneous ground data were collected to characterize residue type, position, direction and percent cover. NDI, MSACRI, SMA and SAM were all computed and used to derive percent crop residue cover information. Preliminary results indicate that the SMA model predicts percent crop residue cover over agricultural fields with the most success, especially over fields of corn residue with an R(2) value of 0.85 (RMSE of 12.46 and D of 0.99). However, further investigation is needed where residue models are validated against a larger dataset with greater variability in percent crop residue cover.

AB Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), MRI sequences, and more generally image time series, constitute 2D + t data providing spatial and temporal information about an observed scene. Given a pattern recognition task such as image classification, considering jointly such rich information is crucial during the decision process. Nevertheless, due to the complex representation of the data-cube, spatio-temporal features extraction from 2D + t data remains difficult to handle. We present in this article an approach to learn such features from this data, and then to proceed to their classification. Our strategy consists in enriching pixel time series with spatial information. It is based on Random Walk to build a novel segment-based representation of the data, passing from a 2D + t dimension to a 2D one, without loosing too much spatial information. Such new representation is then involved in an end-to-end learning process with a classical 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to learn spatio-temporal features for the classification of image time series. Our approach is evaluated on a remote sensing application for the mapping of agricultural crops. Thanks to a visual attention mechanism, the proposed 2D spatio-temporal representation makes also easier the interpretation of a SITS to understand spatio-temporal phenomenons related to soil management practices.

AB Wheat, Triticum durum L, is a major cereal crop in Spain with over five million ha grown annually. Wild oat, Avena sterilis L., and canary grass, Phalaris spp., are distributed only in patches in wheat fields but herbicides are applied over entire fields, thus leading to over-application and unnecessary pollution. To reduce herbicide application, site-specific management techniques based on weed maps are being developed to treat only weed patches. Intensive weed scouting from the ground is time-consuming and expensive, and it relies on estimates of weeds at unsampled points. Remote sensing of weed canopies has been shown to be a more efficient alternative. The principle of weed remote sensing is that there are differences in the spectral reflectance between weeds and crops. To test this principle, we studied spectral signatures taken on the ground in the visible and near-infrared windows for discriminating wheat, wild oat and canary grass at their last phenological stages. Late-season phenological stages included initial seed maturation through advanced maturation for weeds, and initial senescence to senescent for wheat. Spectral signatures were collected on eight sampling dates from April 28 through May 26 using a handheld field spectroradiometer. A stepwise discriminant analysis was used to detect differences in reflectance and to determine the accuracy performance for a species classification as affected by their phenological stage. Four scenarios or classification sets were considered: wheat-wild oat-canary grass, with each species represented by a different group of spectra; wheat and grass weeds, combining the two weed species into one spectral group; wheat and wild oat with each represented as a single group, and finally, wheat and canary grass. Our analysis achieved 100% classification accuracy at the phenological stages of initial seed maturation, and green and advanced seed maturation and partly green for weeds and wheat, respectively, between the dates of April 28 and May 6. Furthermore, we reduced the number of hyperspectral wavelengths to thirteen out of 50. Multispectral analysis also showed that broad wavebands corresponding to those of QuickBird satellite imagery discriminated wild oat, canary grass and wheat at the same phenological stages and dates. Our findings are very useful for determining the timeframe during which future multispectral QuickBird satellite images will be obtained and the concrete wavelengths that should be used in case of using airborne hyperspectral imaging. Accurate and timely mapping of the spatial distribution of weeds is a key element in achieving site-specific herbicide applications for reducing spraying volume of herbicides and costs.

AB Along the season crop classification based on satellite data is challenging task for Ukraine because of a big diversity of different agricultural crops with different phenology (crop calendars). Taking into account the availability for free of high resolution (10 to 30 meter) optical and SAR data from different satellite, the most resource consuming task is ground data collecting. That is why the proper time of ground surveys and crop classification maps developing is very important. In the study we propose to build three crop classification maps for JECAM Ukraine test site in Kyiv region during the vegetation season. The first one is built in the middle of May to classify winter cereals and rapeseeds. The next crop classification map is developing in July to discriminate major summer crops (spring cereals, maize, soybeans, sunflowers). The final crop map is built in autumn to refine summer crops and sugar beet discrimination. Time series of multi-temporal satellite images with restored missing (clouded and shadowed) data are classified using neural network approach, in particular ensemble of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). It is shown, that addition of satellite data from the end of previous year to the spring imagery allows to significantly improve the accuracy of winter crops classification. In July it is possible to deliver the map with major summer crops with overall accuracy higher than 87%, and the overall accuracy of final map at the end of the season is 94%.

AB The blurring of crop images acquired by agricultural Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) due to sudden inputs by operators, atmospheric disturbance, and many other factors will eventually affect the subsequent crop identification, information extraction, and yield estimation. Aiming at the above problems, the new proposed combined deblurring algorithm based on the re-weighted graph total variation (RGTV) and L0-regularized prior, and the other two representative deblurring algorithms were applied to restore blurry crop images acquired during UAV flight, respectively. The restoration performance was measured by subjective vision, and objective evaluation indexes. The crop shape-related and texture-related feature parameters were then extracted, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with four common kernel functions was implemented for crop classification to realize the purpose of crop information extraction. The deblurring results showed that the proposed algorithm performed better in suppressing the ringing effect and preserving the image fine details, and retained higher objective evaluation indexes than the other two deblurring algorithms. The comparative analysis of different classification kernel functions showed that the Polynomial kernel function with an average recognition rate of 94.83% was most suitable for crop classification and recognition. The research will help in further popularization of crop monitoring based on UAV low-altitude remote sensing.

AB It is widely acknowledged that model inputs can cause considerable errors in the model output. Since land cover maps obtained from the classification of remote sensing data are frequently used as input to spatially explicit environmental models, it is important to provide information regarding the classification quality of the produced map. Map quality is generally assessed at the global or class-specific level, using standard methods based on the confusion matrix. Unfortunately, these accuracy measures do not provide information regarding the spatial variability in classification quality. In this paper, we introduce Random Forests for the probabilistic mapping of vegetation from high-dimensional remote sensing data and present a comprehensive methodology to assess and analyze classification uncertainty based on the local probabilities of class membership. We apply this method to SAR image data in order to investigate whether multi-configuration in the dataset decreases the local uncertainty estimates. Polarimetric Land C-band EMISAR data, acquired in April, May, June and July of 1998, and covering the agricultural Foulum test site in Denmark, are used. Results show that multi-configuration in the dataset decreases the classification uncertainty for the different agricultural crops as compared to the single-configuration alternative. Furthermore, the uncertainty assessment reveals lower confidence for the classification of (mixed) pixels at the field edges, and for some fields an uncertainty pattern is observed which is hypothesized to be caused by field preparation practices and cropping system. This study demonstrates that uncertainty assessment provides valuable information on the performance of land cover classification models, both in space and time. Moreover, uncertainty estimates can be easily assessed when using the Random Forests algorithm. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing techniques collect relevant information from Earth surface. This information is useful for deforestation analysis, natural disasters monitoring, urban expansion analysis, and study of climate changes. Multispectral and hyperspectral systems had powered this applications allowing temporal analysis using classical pixel-based techniques and most promising techniques like object-based classifiers. Aiming to study land cover changes in Colombian territory, a remote sensing change detection study is presented in this work. A comparison between pixel-based and object-based techniques was performed over multispectral imaging from Landsat-8 collected over Barrancabermeja city. Obtained results show that objectbased classification technique outperform the pixel based one, besides it shows that Barrancabermeja region is constantly changing, specially by the crops in the rural area but slightly affected by deforestation.

AB Information on spatial land use is the main input in strategic and tactical plan-making by all agricultural participants in countries like India with agriculture at the mainstay of the economy. In addition, accurately evaluation of the management of crops in a spatio-temporal context, information on cropping systems is also required, but such information on a regional scale are scarcely available. The spectrum of multiannual patterns of land use on cultivable land, however, remains unknown. The paper thus focuses on the mapping of the cropping systems that are actually practiced in Hisar District of Haryana (India). The objective of this research was to use satellite data and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques to identify the cropping pattern of Barwala sub-branch of Sirsa branch of the Western Yamuna Canal in Haryana. To identify classes of interest, handheld GPS was used to collect ground-truth information. Mask of mixed classes was developed to reclassify an image under the mask. Moreover, appropriate classification of images and application of logical combinations helped in generating cropping pattern maps and statistics. Results revealed that major crops identified in the study area were cotton, rice and pearl-millet in Kharif season, which accounts for about 70% of total cultivated area. In the case of Rabi season, wheat and mustard were observed as the major crops covering approximately 57% of total area. RS technology is currently capable of providing cropping pattern with 90% accuracy. The results of the current study could be useful in the land use and efficient water management in the canal command areas in the water-scarce southern Haryana, India. Some crops like guar, pearl-millet, horticultural crops, etc. were also identified during this period but the major crops that were identified during Kharif season were Rice and Cotton.

AB It is not easy in remote sensing field to distinguish corn and soybean mapping for the similarity of the mixed summer crops. To understand the variations better and generate corn and soybean maps more accurately, more accurate mapping of these two crops is required. However, classifying different crops with remote sensing is not easy. Finding the discriminating features to use in a mapping classifier can lead to higher-precision mapping. In this paper, we used feature selection of random forests to analyse the most important phenological features for mapping corn and soybeans in the US Corn Belt (also called the Extended Corn Belt, ECB), and identified the spatial and temporal patterns of these features in the ECB. Results show that all the states in the ECB have very similar patterns: Temporal pattern showed that different years always reflected the same pattern. Date-related and phenology curve-related features were the most important. Also, the whole phenology curve was a prerequisite for more accurate mapping. These patterns make the variations more understandable and also support the further research to consider the most important variables for detailed classification.

AB The Common Agricultural Policy, and specifically the part referring to Cross Compliance (CC) is the main tool with which the European Union promotes and enforces environmentally sound practices in agriculture. CC requirements however are extremely complex. Additionally, on-the-spot checks (inspections), the main tool for checking compliance, report ex post facto, are expensive and difficult to perform due to their low level of controllability and verifiability.
   This paper presents results from the work that has been carried out under RE.CAP (EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme Grant Agreement No. 693171). The project aimed at: a) simplifying CC rules, b) facilitating compliance of the farmers with the CC rules and c) reducing the burden of checking cross-compliance while at the same time increasing the controllability and verifiability level of the inspections, through remote sensing, self assessment and acting ex-ante.
   The novelty of this work is that it presents how remote sensing results are incorporated in a real-world system in a form of a pilot that covered a major part of Thessaly (Greece), including 140 farmers and more than 80 agro-consultants. The remote-sensing algorithms used mainly Sentinel-2 images, and provided accurate crop classification for all five major crops that make up 85% of the Greek agricultural land. The presentation will show: a) the RE.CAP system and how remote sensing algorithms were incorporated in it, b) how inspections validated the results, c) The results of the satisfaction survey and d) real-data estimation of the administrative burden reduction due to RE.CAP.
   Overall, the work presented here shows for the first time that an integrated solution combining farmers and inspector participation through self-assessment and remote sensing using Sentinel-2 open data can practically be employed and used to carry out environmental monitoring and protection on a national level.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; ATTENTION
AB Remote sensing image scene classification is a hot research area for its wide applications. More recently, fusion-based methods attract much attention since they are considered to be an useful way for scene feature representation. This paper explores the fusion-based method for remote sensing image scene classification from another viewpoint. First, it is categorized as front side fusion mode, middle side fusion mode, and back side fusion mode. For each fusion mode, the related methods are introduced and described. Then, classification performances of the single side fusion mode and hybrid side fusion mode (combinations of single side fusion) are evaluated. Comprehensive experiments on UC Merced, WHU-RS19, and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets give the comparison result among various fusion methods. The performance comparisons of various modes, and interactions among different fusion modes are also discussed. It is concluded that (1) fusion is an effective way to improve model performance, (2) back side fusion is the most powerful fusion mode, and (3) method with random crop+multiple backbone+average achieves the best performance.

AB Remote sensing data analysis is knowing an unprecedented upswing fostered by the activities of the public and private sectors of geospatial and environmental data analysis. Modern imaging sensors offer the necessary spatial and spectral information to tackle a wide range problems through Earth Observation, such as land cover and use updating, urban dynamics, or vegetation and crop monitoring. In the upcoming years even richer information will be available: more sophisticated hyperspectral sensors with high spectral resolution, multispectral sensors with sub-metric spatial detail or drones that can be deployed in very short time lapses. Besides such opportunities, these new and wealthy information sources also come with a price: the analysts are confronted with data showing large and complex feature characteristics. To deal with these new challenges, kernel methods have emerged as a valid, robust and successful framework. The intrinsic regularization implemented in these methods and their low sensitivity to data dimensionality make them natural candidates to solve current remote sensing problems. The flexibility offered by kernel methods allows us to treat heavily nonlinear tasks with elegant methodologies, while still using linear algebra. In the last decade, kernel methods in general, and support vector machines for classification and Gaussian processes for regression in particular, have become standard tools for geospatial data analysis. In this chapter, we first review the main concepts about kernel methods and their use in remote sensing. Then, we review examples of kernel methods for remote sensing image classification and biophysical parameter retrieval.

TI WHEAT PRODUCTION FORECASTING FOR A PREDOMINANTLY UNIRRIGATED REGION IN
   MADHYA-PRADESH (INDIA)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID LANDSAT-MSS
AB The area under wheat was estimated and a forecast of production made in a predominantly un-irrigated region (36 per cent irrigated wheat crop, geographical area 5.61 Mha) of Madhya Pradesh (India) using digital data from LISS-I (Linear Imaging Self Scanner) onboard Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1B), for the crop season 1991-92. A stratified sampling approach based on 5 km by 5 km sample segments, 10 per cent sampling fraction in conjunction with supervised maximum likelihood (MXL) classification was used for wheat acreage estimation. Yield forecasts were based on an optimal combination of forecasts from two different methodologies, viz., wheat yield-spectral relationship and time series analysis using ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) approach. In the former, a two-year (1989-90, 1990-91) pooled regression relating LISS-I derived Near Infrared/Red (NIR/R) radiance ratio to district wheat yields was developed and used to forecast wheat yields for the year 1991-92 based on classified wheat pixels. In the latter case, historical district-wise wheat yield data of 35 years was used to develop appropriate ARIMA models and used to forecast 1991-92 yields. The relative deviation of remotely-sensed-based forecasted production, acreage and yield from the post-harvest estimates released later by the State Department of Agriculture were -15.8, -10.02 and -6.01 per cent, respectively. The acreage and yield meet the accuracy of 85 per cent at 90 and 95 per cent confidence levels, respectively.

AB Land use-land cover (LULC) mapping has immerged as a useful and important Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technique for improving the management of natural resources for the progress of a country like Pakistan. Therefore, a research study was conducted to develop LULC maps for the District of Multan, Pakistan. For this purpose, economically available multi temporal (time series) images with acceptable resolution from satellite (LANDSAT 7 ETM+) were obtained for Rabi and Kharif season of 2011-12 to perform supervised classification and identification of crops in the study area. Image Processing was performed in ERDAS Imagine 2011 version for obtaining the high-class time series normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) for each LANDSAT 7 imagery. Four classes were targeted for crops out of the seven clusters created using target crop signatures with 95% maximum likely-hood. The resulting crop types were validated by 86 ground truthing points. Over all 74 % efficiency was found using error matrix technique. The regional irrigation water requirements of specific crops were estimated using the generated LULC maps of exerted crop area. The calculated cropped areas through ArcGIS 9.3 version were of 0.226 Mha for cotton, 0.207 Mha for wheat, 0.014 Mha for rice and 0.007 Mha for sugarcane. The total regional crop water requirement of the study area was of 1653.62 Mm(3) for cotton, 911.25 Mm(3) for wheat, 97.93 Mm(3) for rice and 112.25 Mm(3) for sugarcane. The LULC mapping technique should be used to develop a decision support system for water, land and other natural resources at scale for efficient resource utilization and sustainable development.

AB Crop maps are key inputs for crop inventory production and yield estimation and can inform the implementation of effective farm management practices. Producing these maps at detailed scales requires exhaustive field surveys that can be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to replicate. With a growing archive of remote sensing data, there are enormous opportunities to exploit dense satellite image time series (SITS), temporal sequences of images over the same area. Generally, crop type mapping relies on single-sensor inputs and is solved with the help of traditional learning algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have brought significant improvements by leveraging information in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are relevant in crop studies. The concurrent availability of Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data offers a great opportunity to utilize them jointly; however, optimizing their synergy has been understudied with deep learning techniques. In this work, we analyze and compare three fusion strategies (input, layer, and decision levels) to identify the best strategy that optimizes optical-radar classification performance. They are applied to a recent architecture, notably, the pixel-set encoder-temporal attention encoder (PSE-TAE) developed specifically for object-based classification of SITS and based on self-attention mechanisms. Experiments are carried out in Brittany, in the northwest of France, with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. Input and layer-level fusion competitively achieved the best overall F-score surpassing decision-level fusion by 2%. On a per-class basis, decision-level fusion increased the accuracy of dominant classes, whereas layer-level fusion improves up to 13% for minority classes. Against single-sensor baseline, multi-sensor fusion strategies identified crop types more accurately: for example, input-level outperformed Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 by 3% and 9% in F-score, respectively. We have also conducted experiments that showed the importance of fusion for early time series classification and under high cloud cover condition.

AB Time-series remote sensing data offer a rich source of information that can be used in a wide range of applications, from monitoring changes in land cover to surveillance of crops, coastal changes, flood risk assessment, and urban sprawl. In this paper, time-series satellite images are used to predict urban expansion. As the ground truth is not available in time-series satellite images, an unsupervised image segmentation method based on deep learning is used to generate the ground truth for training and validation. The automated annotated images are then manually validated using Google Maps to generate the ground truth. The remaining data were then manually annotated. Prediction of urban expansion is achieved by using a ConvLSTM network, which can learn the global spatio-temporal information without shrinking the size of spatial feature maps. The ConvLSTM based model is applied on the time-series satellite images and the results of prediction are compared with Pix2pix and Dual GAN networks. In this paper, experimental results are conducted using several multi-date satellite images representing the three largest cities in Saudi Arabia, namely: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The evaluation results show that the proposed ConvLSTM based model produced better prediction results in terms of Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and overall classification accuracy as compared to Pix2pix and Dual GAN. Moreover, the training time of the proposed architecture is less than the Dual GAN architecture.

AB Groundwater assists farmers to irrigate crops for fulfilling the crop-water requirement. Indian agriculture system is characterized by three cropping seasons known as Kharif (monsoon), Rabi (post-monsoon) and summer (pre-monsoon). In tropical countries like India, monitoring cropping practices using optical remote sensing during Kharif and Rabi seasons is constraint due to the cloud cover, which can be well addressed by microwave remote sensing. In the proposed research, the strength of C-band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series images were evaluated to classify groundwater irrigated croplands for the Kharif and Rabi cropping seasons of the year 2013. The present study was performed in the Berambadi experimental watershed of Kabini river basin, southern peninsular India. A total of fifteen polarimetric variables were estimated includes four backscattering coefficients (HH, HV, VH, VV) and eleven polarimetric indices for all Radarsat-2 SAR images. The cumulative temporal sum (seasonal and dual-season) of these parameters was supervised classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with intensive ground observation samples. Classification results using the best equation (highest accuracy and kappa) shows that the Kharif, Rabi and irrigated double croplands are respectively 9.58 km(2) (20.6%), 16.14 km(2) (34.7%) and 6.22 km(2) (13.4%) with a kappa coefficient respectively 0.84, 0.74 and 0.94.

AB The adoption of new cropping practices such as integrated Crop-Livestock systems (iCL) aims at improving the land use sustainability of the agricultural sector in the Brazilian Amazon. The emergence of such integrated systems, based on crop and pasture rotations over and within years, challenges the remote sensing community who needs to implement accurate and efficient methods to process satellite image time series (SITS) in order to come up with a monitoring protocol. These methods generally include a SITS preprocessing step which can be time consuming. The aim of this study is to assess the importance of preprocessing operations such as temporal smoothing and computation of phenological metrics on the mapping of main cropping systems (i.e. pasture, single cropping, double cropping and iCL), with a special emphasis on the iCL class. The study area is located in the state of Mato Grosso, an important producer of agriculture commodities located in the Southern Brazilian Amazon. SITS were composed of a set of 16-day composites of MODIS Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1 product) covering a one year period between 2014 and 2015. Two widely used classifiers, i.e. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were tested using five data sets issued from a same SITS but with different preprocessing levels: (i) raw NDVI; (ii) raw NDVI + raw EVI; (iii) smoothed NDVI; (iv) NDVI-derived phenometrics; (v) raw NDVI + phenometrics. Both RF and SVM classification results showed that the "raw NDVI + raw EVI" data set achieved the highest performance (RF OA = 0.96, RF Kappa = 0.94, SVM OA = 0.95, SVM Kappa = 0.93), followed closely by the "raw NDVI" and the "raw NDVI + phenometrics" datasets. The "NDVI-derived phenometrics" alone achieved the lowest accuracies (RF OA = 0.58 and SVM OA = 0.66). Considering that the implementation of preprocessing steps is computationally expensive and does not provide significant gains in terms of classification accuracy, we recommend to use raw vegetation indices for mapping cropping practices in Mato Grosso, including the integrated Crop-Livestock systems.

AB The Loess Plateau suffers the most serious soil erosion in China. Sloping cultivated land is one of the most common land types in the region, and it leads to severe soil erosion. Analyses based on fine resolution satellite imagery can play a key role in the surveying of sloping farmland. In this article, a combination of remote-sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques under the hierarchical classification framework is used to investigate the sloping cultivated land in the Xi-He ecological engineering demonstration region of the Loess Plateau. This article synthetically adopts Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) high-resolution images, Thematic Mapper (TM) multi-spectral images, and a terrain map at a scale of 1:10,000 to calculate the spectral, textural, and slope attributes of the sloping land type. A Bayesian classification method is employed to distinguish the crop and non-crop areas with a priori knowledge provided by local experts. The Gabor filter and the grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) method are used in combination under a man-machine interactive interpretation to extract the differences of texture trends and density distributions between sloping cultivated land and terraces, and a window-based method of texture analysis operations is adopted. A classification accuracy assessment by field survey shows that the total interpretation accuracy exceeds 80%. The sloping cultivated land in the research region covers an area of 233.06 km(2), and the sub-watersheds, such as the Yangliu watershed, need key management in the future.

AB Crop identification in large irrigation districts is important for crop yield estimation, hydrological simulation, and agricultural water management. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to visualize crops in the regional scale. However, the use of coarse resolution remote sensing images for crop identification usually causes great errors due to the presence of mixed pixels in regions with complex planting structure of crops. Therefore, it is preferable to use remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolutions in crop identification. This study aimed to map multi-year distributions of major crops (maize and sunflower) in Hetao Irrigation District, the third largest irrigation district in China, using HJ-1A/1B CCD images with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to find the NDVI characteristics and phenological metrics for both maize and sunflower. Nine combinations of NDVI characteristics and phenological metrics were compared to obtain the optimal classifier to map maize and sunflower from 2009 to 2015. Results showed that the classification ellipse with the NDVI characteristic of the left inflection point in the NDVI curve and the phenological metric from the left inflection point to the peak point normalized, with mean values of corresponding grassland indexes achieving the minimum mean relative error of 10.82% for maize and 4.38% for sunflower. The corresponding Kappa coefficient was 0.62. These results indicated that the vegetation and phenology-based classifier using HJ-1A/1B data could effectively identify multi-year distribution of maize and sunflower in the study region. It was found that maize was mainly distributed in the middle part of the irrigation district (Hangjinhouqi and Linhe), while sunflower mainly in the east part (Wuyuan). The planting sites of sunflower had been gradually expanded from Wuyuan to the north part of Hangjinhouqi and Linhe. These results were in agreement with the local economic policy. Results also revealed the increasing trends of both maize and sunflower planting areas during the study period.

AB The loss of species is an ongoing process threatening the services provided by ecosystems for humanity. In agricultural areas, which globally occupy the largest areas, species diversity is strongly dependent on the farmers' management. If management allows for a landscape structure with many remnants of natural or semi-natural vegetation, the diversity and amount of flora and fauna is higher compared to intensive agricultural landscapes with large, continuous field parcels and a low crop variety. Knowledge of agricultural management is crucial for the development and monitoring of political strategies that aim to enhance or conserve species in agricultural areas. Remote sensing is a cost effective way to acquire this knowledge for large spatial areas with high temporal resolution. Since 2008, modern satellite-based radar sensors deliver images of unprecedented high quality. Since the acquisition of radar images is not restricted by atmospheric conditions, it is very capable of multitemporal classifications. In the presented study, possibilities for supervised multitemporal classification of non crop areas are investigated based on TerraSAR-X images and two different classifiers (Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest). The best results were achieved for the classification of woody structures where producer's accuracies are above 80%. Despite lower values for the other classes (flower strips 75%, grasslands 75.8% and herbaceous 57%), these classes are easily recognized. This is illustrated by different map examples. The presented results can contribute essentially to the monitoring, investigation and increasing of habitat structures in agricultural areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen (N) is significantly related to crop photosynthetic capacity. Over-and-under-application of N fertilizers not only limits crop productivity but also leads to negative environment impacts. With such a dilemma, a feasible solution is to match N supply with crop needs across time and space. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been gradually regarded as a cost-effective alternative to traditional destructive field sampling and laboratory testing for crop N status determination. Hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) and linear nonparametric regression have been the dominant techniques used to estimate crop N status. Machine learning algorithms have gradually exerted advantages in modelling the non-linear relationships between spectral data and crop N. Physically-based methods were rarely used due to the lack of radiative transfer models directly involving N. The existing crop N retrieval methods rely heavily on the relationship between chlorophyll and N. The underlying mechanisms of using protein as a proxy of N and crop protein retrieval from canopy hyperspectral data need further exploration. A comprehensive survey of the existing N-related hyperspectral VIs was made with the aim to provide guidance in VI selection for practical application. The combined use of feature mining and machine learning algorithms was emphasized in the overview. Some feature mining methods applied in the field of classification and chemometrics might be adapted for extracting crop N-related features. The deep learning algorithms need further exploration in crop N status assessment from canopy hyperspectral data. Finally, the major challenges and further development direction in crop N status assessment were discussed. The overview could provide a theoretical and technical support to promote applications of hyperspectral remote sensing in crop N status assessment.

AB Automatic detection and monitoring of freezing injury in crops is of vital importance for assessing plant physiological status and yield losses. This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral techniques for detecting leaves at the stages of freezing and post-thawing injury, and for quantifying the impacts of freezing injury on leaf water and pigment contents. Four experiments were carried out to acquire hyperspectral reflectance and biochemical parameters for oilseed rape plants subjected to freezing treatment. Principal component analysis and support vector machines were applied to raw reflectance, first and second derivatives (SDR), and inverse logarithmic reflectance to differentiate freezing and the different stages of post-thawing from the normal leaf state. The impacts on biochemical retrieval using particular spectral domains were also assessed using a multivariate analysis. Results showed that SDR generated the highest classification accuracy (>95.6%) in the detection of post-thawed leaves. The optimal ratio vegetation index (RVI) generated the highest predictive accuracy for changes in leaf water content, with a cross validated coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85 and a cross validated root mean square error (RMSECV) of 2.4161 mg/cm(2). Derivative spectral indices outperformed multivariate statistical methods for the estimation of changes in pigment contents. The highest accuracy was found between the optimal RVI and the change in carotenoids content (R-cv(2) = 0.70 and RMSECV = 0.0015 mg/cm(2)). The spectral domain 400-900 nm outperformed the full spectrum in the estimation of individual pigment contents, and hence this domain can be used to reduce redundancy and increase computational efficiency in future operational scenarios. Our findings indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing has considerable potential for characterizing freezing injury in oilseed rape, and this could form a basis for developing satellite remote sensing products for crop monitoring.

AB This work was undertaken to develop a low-cost but reliable assessment method for agricultural water requirements in semi-arid locations based on remote sensing data/techniques. In semi-arid locations, water resources are often limited, and long-term water consumption may exceed the natural replenishment rates of groundwater reservoirs. Sustainable land management in these locations must include tools that facilitate assessment of the impact of potential future land use changes. Agricultural practices in the Boufakrane River watershed (Morocco) were used as a case study application. Land use practices were mapped at the thematic resolution of individual crops, using a total of 13 images generated from the Sentinel-2 satellites. Using a supervised classification scheme, crop types were identified as cereals, other crops followed by cereals, vegetables, olive trees, and fruit trees. Two classifiers were used, namely Support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). A validation of the classified parcels showed a high overall accuracy of 89.76% for SVM and 84.03% for RF. Results showed that cereal is the most represented species, covering 8870.43 ha and representing 52.42% of the total area, followed by olive trees with 4323.18 ha and a coverage rate of 25%. Vegetables and other crops followed by cereals cover 1530.06 ha and 1661.45 ha, respectively, representing 9.4% and 9.8% of the total area. In the last rank, fruit trees occupy only 3.67% of the total area, with 621.06 ha. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) free software was used to overlay satellite data images with those of climate for agricultural water resources management in the region. This process facilitated estimations of irrigation water requirements for all crop types, taking into account total potential evapotranspiration, effective rainfall, and irrigation water requirements. Results showed that olive trees, fruit trees, and other crops followed by cereals are the most water demanding, with irrigation requirements exceeding 500 mm. The irrigation requirements of cereals and vegetables are lower than those of other classes, with amounts of 300 mm and 150 mm, respectively.

AB Traditional smallholder farming systems dominate the savanna range countries of sub-Saharan Africa and provide the foundation for the region's food security. Despite continued expansion of smallholder farming into the surrounding savanna landscapes, food insecurity in the region persists. Central to the monitoring of food security in these countries, and to understanding the processes behind it, are reliable, high-quality datasets of cultivated land. Remote sensing has been frequently used for this purpose but distinguishing crops under certain stages of growth from savanna woodlands has remained a major challenge. Yet, crop production in dryland ecosystems is most vulnerable to seasonal climate variability, amplifying the need for high quality products showing the distribution and extent of cropland. The key objective in this analysis is the development of a classification protocol for African savanna landscapes, emphasizing the delineation of cropland. We integrate remote sensing techniques with probabilistic modeling into an innovative workflow. We present summary results for this methodology applied to a land cover classification of Zambia's Southern Province. Five primary land cover categories are classified for the study area, producing an overall map accuracy of 88.18%. Omission error within the cropland class is 12.11% and commission error 9.76%.

AB The current study was taken up to investigate the utility of remote sensing and GIS tools for evaluation of Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP) implemented during 1997-2001 in Katangidda Nala watershed, Chincholi taluk, Gulbarga district, Karnataka. The study was carried out using IRS 1C, LISS III data of December 11, 1997 (pre-treatment) and November 15, 2002 (post-treatment) covering the watershed to assess the changes in land use/land cover and biomass that have changed over a period of five years (1997-2002). The images were classified into different land use/land cover categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach. The results indicated that the area under agriculture crops and forest land were increased by 671 ha (5.7%) and 1,414 ha (11.94%) respectively. This is due to the fact that parts of wastelands and fallow lands were brought into cultivation. This increase in the area may be attributed to better utilization of surface and ground waters, adoption of soil and water conservation practices and changes in cropping pattern. The area under waste lands and fallow lands decreased by 1,667 ha (14.07%) and 467 ha (3.94%), respectively. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (502 ha and 19 ha respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing and GIS was 2.2 times cheaper than the conventional methods. Thus, the repetitive coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the land resources and evaluate the land cover changes through comparison of images for the watershed at different periods.

In contrast, there has been very little systematic evaluation of various enhancements, such as different colour composites, for visual interpretations. This study examined three Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) colour composites for visual classification of agricultural crops in an Imperial Valley, California study area. Accuracy results varied considerably with the composite from the best three bands as determined by transformed divergence calculations being more useful than an image obtained via principle components or the standard infrared simulated false colour composite.

AB Cover crop is an agriculture operation that is planted during the winter and owns several advantages such as improving water quality and soil quality. However, the large-scale effect of cover crop in relieving environmental burden and improving cash crop yield over a region has not been widely investigated. Due to cost and time limitation, it is not favorable to conduct the conventional field trials. Previous study proposed a Random Forest classifier to predict the pattern of cover crop adoption from the remote sensing data. In this study, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron neural network to further improve the performance and reliability of the classification model and achieve an accuracy of 0.93 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.76. Moreover, the Multilayer Perceptron model outperforms two baseline classification models. Finally, we predict the cover crop planting status for the Knox County and found a significant increase in cover crop planting on the corn cropland in 2016.

AB Crop-type identification is one of the most significant applications of agricultural remote sensing, and it is important for yield estimation prediction and field management. At present, crop identification using datasets from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms have achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, accurate monitoring of small plants, such as the coffee flower, cannot be achieved using datasets from these platforms. With the development of time-lapse image acquisition technology based on ground-based remote sensing, a large number of small-scale plantation datasets with high spatial-temporal resolution are being generated, which can provide great opportunities for small target monitoring of a specific region. The main contribution of this paper is to combine the binarization algorithm based on OTSU and the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to improve coffee flower identification accuracy using the time-lapse images (i.e., digital images). A certain number of positive and negative samples are selected from the original digital images for the network model training. Then, the pretrained network model is initialized using the VGGNet and trained using the constructed training datasets. Based on the well-trained CNN model, the coffee flower is initially extracted, and its boundary information can be further optimized by using the extracted coffee flower result of the binarization algorithm. Based on the digital images with different depression angles and illumination conditions, the performance of the proposed method is investigated by comparison of the performances of support vector machine (SVM) and CNN model. Hence, the experimental results show that the proposed method has the ability to improve coffee flower classification accuracy. The results of the image with a 52.5 degrees angle of depression under soft lighting conditions are the highest, and the corresponding Dice (F1) and intersection over union (IoU) have reached 0.80 and 0.67, respectively.

AB Benefits of converting 11 years of remote sensing classification data into cropping history of agricultural fields included measuring lengths of rotation cycles and identifying specific sequences of intervening crops grown between final years of old grass seed stands and establishment of new ones. Spatial and non-spatial methods were complementary. Individual-year classification errors were often correctable in spreadsheet-based non-spatial analysis, whereas their presence in spatial data generally led to exclusion of fields from further analysis. Markov-model testing of non-spatial data revealed that year-to-year cropping sequences did not match average frequencies for transitions among crops grown in western Oregon, implying that rotations into new grass seed stands were influenced by growers' desires to achieve specific objectives. Moran's I spatial analysis of length of time between consecutive grass seed stands revealed that clustering of fields was relatively uncommon, with high and low value clusters only accounting for 7.1 and 6.2% of fields.

AB Monitoring shoreline is important for planning and development in the coastal region. This study utilizes remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) techniques to observe the dynamics of the shoreline in the coastal region of Sayung, Indonesia, from 1988 up to 2017. Multi-temporal remote sensing images from Thematic Mapper (TM), Advance Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) were used in fuzzy classification followed by thresholding to generate shorelines. Post classification change detection was implemented to analyse changes in shoreline position in the study area. From these changes, erosion and accretion areas along the coast were inferred. The results show a general trend of continuous shoreline changes as a result of increasing coastal inundation. Between 1988 and 2017, 25% of the area has changed from non-water to water and 5% of the area has changed from non-water to shoreline margin. Comparison with the land use/cover (LUC) maps showed that these changes were related to the changes from other crops and paddy field into fishpond and from fishpond into water body.

AB A wide range of image processing studies are based on the extraction of texture features, the analysis of input data and the identification and design of appropriate classifiers given a particular application, for instance, in the fields of industrial inspection, remote sensing, medicine or biology amongst others. In this paper, we introduce a novel generalized classification framework for texture imagery based on a novel building blocks system architecture and present the advantages of such a system to tackle a variety of image analysis problems at the same time of obtaining good classification performances. Firstly, an overview of the system architecture is described from the texture feature extraction module to the data analysis and the classification building blocks. Thus, we obtain an optimized and generic classification framework which is highly flexible due to its scalable building blocks system approach and provides the facility to extend easily the study obtained for textural images to other kind of imagery.
   The results of this generalized classification framework are validated using imagery from two different application fields where texture plays a key role. The first one is in the field of remote sensing for agriculture crops classification and the second one, in the area of non-destructive industrial inspection.

AB Information on crop types derived from remotely sensed images provides valuable input for many applications such as crop growth modeling and yield forecasting. In this paper, a random forest (RF) classifier was used for crop classification using multispectral RapidEye imagery over two study sites, one in north-eastern China and one in eastern Ontario, Canada. Both vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features were derived from the RapidEye imagery and used for classification. A total of 20 VIs, categorized into two groups with and without the red edge (RE) band in an index, were calculated. A total of eight types of textural features were derived using four different window sizes from both the RE and the near-infrared bands. To reduce redundancies among the VIs and textural features, feature selection using the principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and stepwise discriminant analysis was performed. Results showed that the overall classification accuracy was improved by similar to 7% when the RE indices were combined with the five spectral bands in classification, as compared with that using the five bands alone. When textural information was included, the overall classification accuracy increased by similar to 6% compared with that using the band reflectance alone. Furthermore, when all the features (band reflectance, VIs, and texture) were used, the overall classification accuracy increased by similar to 12% compared with that using only the band reflectance. The RF importance measures showed that the RE reflectance was important for classification, as indicated by the high importance for the triangular vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index, and green-rededge normalized difference vegetation index. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix mean is the most useful for classification among the textural features. The study provides a means to feature extraction and selection for crop classification from remote sensing imagery.

AB Classification of land cover and land use is one of ROCSAT-2 primary applications. Spectral reflectance experiments were conducted for classification of the main land use and land cover in Taiwan. The four Level 1 categories of USGS classification system were picked out for classification of the major territory in Taiwan. The fourteen subcategories with fourteen different crops were further classified for the agricultural land use. The barren land is classified into five subcategories. The spectral reflectance of each category or subcategory was recorded with a spectro-radiometer, GER3700, with 702 channels. Since the spectral range of GER3700 covers the four color bands, blue, green, red and infrared of the ROCSAT-2 Remote Sensing Imager, the recorded data were derived into simulated reflectance in the color bands of the ROCSAT-2 Remote Sensing Imager. To use a multiple end-member spectral mixed model, the correlation among the category and/or subcategory was calculated. Yam, dry sand and water were selected as the local three end-members for their low correlation of spectral reflectance. The spectral reflectance of other categories is coded as the components of the local end-members.

AB This research work aims to develop a deep learning-based crop classification framework for remotely sensed time series data.Tobaccois a major revenue generating crop of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan, with over 90% of the country'sTobaccoproduction. In order to analyze the performance of the developed classification framework, a pilot sub-region named Yar Hussain is selected for experimentation work. Yar Hussain is a tehsil of district Swabi, within KP province of Pakistan, having highest contribution to the gross production of the KPTobaccocrop. KP generally consists of a diverse crop land with different varieties of vegetation, having similar phenology which makes crop classification a challenging task. In this study, a temporal convolutional neural network (TempCNNs) model is implemented for crop classification, while considering remotely sensed imagery of the selected pilot region with specific focus on theTobaccocrop. In order to improve the performance of the proposed classification framework, instead of using the prevailing concept of utilizing a single satellite imagery, both Sentinel-2 and Planet-Scope imageries are stacked together to assist in providing more diverse features to the proposed classification framework. Furthermore, instead of using a single date satellite imagery, multiple satellite imageries with respect to the phenological cycle ofTobaccocrop are temporally stacked together which resulted in a higher temporal resolution of the employed satellite imagery. The developed framework is trained using the ground truth data. The final output is obtained as an outcome of the SoftMax function of the developed model in the form of probabilistic values, for the classification of the selected classes. The proposed deep learning-based crop classification framework, while utilizing multi-satellite temporally stacked imagery resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 98.15%. Furthermore, as the developed classification framework evolved with specific focus onTobaccocrop, it resulted in bestTobaccocrop classification accuracy of 99%.

AB Generation of a thematic map is important for scientists and agriculture engineers in analyzing different crops in a given field. Remote sensing data are well-accepted for image classification on a vast area of crop investigation. However, most of the research has currently focused on the classification of pixel-based image data for analysis. The study was carried out to develop a multi-category crop hyperspectral image classification system to identify the major crops in the Chiayi Golden Corridor. The hyperspectral image data from CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) were used as the experimental data in this study. A two-stage classification was designed to display the performance of the image classification. More specifically, the study used a multi-class classification by support vector machine (SVM) + convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification analysis. SVM is a supervised learning model that analyzes data used for classification. CNN is a class of deep neural networks that is applied to analyzing visual imagery. The image classification comparison was made among four crops (paddy rice, potatoes, cabbages, and peanuts), roads, and structures for classification. In the first stage, the support vector machine handled the hyperspectral image classification through pixel-based analysis. Then, the convolution neural network improved the classification of image details through various blocks (cells) of segmentation in the second stage. A series of discussion and analyses of the results are presented. The repair module was also designed to link the usage of CNN and SVM to remove the classification errors.

AB Improved data on crop type and crop area from satellite imagery are invaluable for agronomy managers and are crucial for balancing agricultural expansion and forest degradation. However, large-scale maps of crop type and crop area using satellite imagery are not easily available in some regions, especially Brazil. Reasons for this include limited ground truth data, inadequate spatial and temporal satellite data availability, computational challenges, lack of cropland data and field boundaries. In this paper, we attempted to overcome some of these obstacles by using an ensemble of approaches to generate crop classification maps for Brazil. In order to compensate for the lack of abundant ground truth data in Brazil, we combined extensive field data and satellite input features from the United States with available field data and satellite input features from Brazil to train crop classification model for Brazil. Before applying the crop classification model for Brazil, we classified cropland areas using harmonic functions and delineated field boundaries using a supervised deep learning approach. Cropland masking and field boundary delineation allowed field-level mapping of crop type and crop area. Applying the crop classification model for Brazil in the states of Mato Grosso and Goias gave a true positive accuracy of 88% in the 2017/2018 summer growing season for soybean classification, 95% in the 2018 safrinha growing season for corn classification, and 86% in the 2018/2019 summer growing season for soybean classification. Our crop area estimates also showed a good agreement (correlation of 0.95 and mean absolute error of 0.64) with state-scale statistical data provided by the Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB) in both summer and safrinha growing seasons adding further confidence to the results. These results suggest that extensive data from one geography can be used to train machine learning models in conjunction with limited field data from another geography. Accuracy assessments support the portability of crop classification model for Brazil with reasonable accuracy spatially, as tested in the state of Parana, and temporally, to the following year. The approaches and datasets presented in this paper provide building blocks for large-scale crop monitoring benefitting both public and private sectors.

AB Precision viticulture benefits from the accurate detection of vineyard vegetation from remote sensing, without a priori knowledge of vine locations. Vineyard detection enables efficient, and potentially automated, derivation of spatial measures such as length and area of crop, and hence required volumes of water, fertilizer, and other resources. Machine learning techniques have provided significant advancements in recent years in the areas of image segmentation, classification, and object detection, with neural networks shown to perform well in the detection of vineyards and other crops. However, what has not been extensively quantitatively examined is the extent to which the initial choice of input imagery impacts detection/segmentation accuracy. Here, we use a standard deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and segment vineyards across Australia using DigitalGlobe Worldview-2 images at similar to 50 cm (panchromatic) and similar to 2 m (multispectral) spatial resolution. A quantitative assessment of the variation in model performance with input parameters during model training is presented from a remote sensing perspective, with combinations of panchromatic, multispectral, pan-sharpened multispectral, and the spectral Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) considered. The impact of image acquisition parameters-namely, the off-nadir angle and solar elevation angle-on the quality of pan-sharpening is also assessed. The results are synthesised into a 'recipe' for optimising the accuracy of vineyard segmentation, which can provide a guide to others aiming to implement or improve automated crop detection and classification.

First, a stratification of the county into arable land, permanent crops and non agricultural land was carried out by photo-interpreting a grid of points on Google Earth and a 2.5m Spot5 image from 2011. Then a sample of 83 segments was randomly selected in the arable stratum and surveyed with GPS. Two high resolution images (TM 30m and Spot5 10m) were acquired over the 2011 summer crop season and classified using maximum likelihood. The regression estimator was then applied using the surveyed segments and the classification and compared to the direct expansion estimate derived from the segments only; the calibration estimator was also tested using the same classification and the 83 arable points that served as seeds for the segments and compared to the estimate derived from the 83 points alone. The regression estimator proved to be the most efficient one in the North China Plain landscape. To reach the same variance of estimate as the regression estimator, the number of points to be surveyed for the calibration estimator should be multiplied by seven. Last pixel counting tested on the whole county and on the arable points of the grid resulted in biased estimates, in contrast to estimates based on ground data, in combination with remote sensing or not.

AB Wheat is an economically important Rabi crop for the state, which is grown on around 26% of total available agriculture area in the state. There is a variation in productivity of wheat crop in hilly and tarai region. The agricultural productivity is less in hilly region in comparison of tarai region due to terrace cultivation, traditional system of agriculture, small land holdings, variation in physiography, top soil erosion, lack of proper irrigation system etc.
   Pre-harvest acreage/yield/production estimation of major crops is being done with the help of conventional crop cutting method, which is biased, inaccurate and time consuming. Remote Sensing data with multi-temporal and multi-spectral capabilities has shown new dimension in crop discrimination analysis and acreage/yield/production estimation in recent years.
   In view of this, Uttarakhand Space Applications Centre (USAC), Dehradun with the collaboration of Space Applications Centre (SAC), ISRO, Ahmedabad and Uttarakhand State Agriculture Department, have developed different techniques for the discrimination of crops and estimation of pre-harvest wheat acreage/yield/production. In the 1st phase, five districts (Dehradun, Almora, Udham Singh Nagar, Pauri Garhwal and Haridwar) with distinct physiography i. e. hilly and plain regions, have been selected for testing and verification of techniques using IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellites), LISS-III, LISS-IV satellite data of Rabi season for the year 2008-09 and whole 13 districts of the Uttarakhand state from 2009-14 along with ground data were used for detailed analysis. Five methods have been developed i. e. NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index), Supervised classification, Spatial modeling, Masking out method and Programming on visual basics methods using multitemporal satellite data of Rabi season along with the collateral and ground data. These methods were used for wheat discriminations and preharvest acreage estimations and subsequently results were compared with Bureau of Estimation Statistics (BES). Out of these five different methods, wheat area that was estimated by spatial modeling and programming on visual basics has been found quite near to Bureau of Estimation Statistics (BES). But for hilly region, maximum fields were going in shadow region, so it was difficult to estimate accurate result, so frequency distribution curve method has been used and frequency range has been decided to discriminate wheat pixels from other pixels in hilly region, digitized those regions and result shows good result. For yield estimation, an algorithm has been developed by using soil characteristics i. e. texture, depth, drainage, temperature, rainfall and historical yield data. To get the production estimation, estimated yield multiplied by acreage of crop per hectare. Result shows deviation for acreage estimation from BES is around 3.28 %, 2.46%, 3.45%, 1.56%, 1.2% and 1.6% (estimation not declared till now by state Agriculture dept. For the year 2013-14) estimation and deviation for production estimation is around 4.98 %, 3.66% 3.21%, 3.1% NA and 2.9% for the consecutive above mentioned years i. e. 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. The estimated data has been provided to State Agriculture department for their use. To forecast production before harvest facilitate the formulation of workable marketing strategies leading to better export/import of crop in the state, which will help to lead better economic condition of the state. Yield estimation would help agriculture department in assessment of productivity of land for specific crop. Pre-harvest wheat acreage/production estimation, is useful to facilitate the reliable and timely estimates and enable the administrators and planners to take strategic decisions on import-export policy matters and trade negotiations.

AB Classification maps are required for agricultural management and the estimation of agricultural disaster compensation. The extreme learning machine (ELM), a newly developed single hidden layer neural network is used as a supervised classifier for remote sensing classifications. In this study, the ELM was evaluated to examine its potential for multi-temporal ALOS/PALSAR images for the classification of crop type. In addition, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), one of the traditional classification methods, was also applied for comparison with the ELM. In the study area, beans, beets, grasses, maize, potato, and winter wheat were cultivated; and these crop types in each field were identified using a data set acquired in 2010. The result of ELM classification was superior to that of k-NN; and overall accuracy was 79.3%. This study highlights the advantages of ALOS/PALSAR images for agricultural field monitoring and indicates the usefulness of regular monitoring using the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 system.

AB Understanding the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) changes is fundamental for rational and specific planning for sustainable land management. Using remote sensing techniques, geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical modeling via multinomial logistic regression, we sought to identify spatial variables that determine LULC change and their extent over time in the protected and communal areas of the Zambezi Region, Namibia. Multi-temporal satellite imagery of the Landsat series was used to map changes over a period of twenty-six years, divided into three stages (1984-1991, 1991-2000 and 2000-2010). Post classification change detection methodologies were used to determine conversions between LULC classes. Additionally, socio-economic characteristics of the area were used to identify drivers of changes. Four spatial drivers of LULC change that we identified included the distance to the nearest road, distance to settlements, population density and fire return periods. Population density, distance to settlements and fire return period were significantly associated with conversion from crop/grass land to crop/grass land and forest land to crop/grass, forest land to bare land and forest land to forest land in the protected area. In communal areas, distance to the road was found to significantly influence conversion from crop/grass land to crop/grass land. The study concluded that the influence of these drivers is attributable to distinct political and agro-demographical differences during the study period. Policy makers and planners need to take these drivers into consideration together with their subsidiaries to respond and make sound decisions regarding undesirable changes in LULC.

AB The soybean is important to the economy of Brazil, so the estimation of the planted area and the production with higher antecedence and reliability becomes essential. Techniques related to Remote Sensing may help to obtain this information at lower cost and less subjectivity in relation to traditional surveys. The aim of this study is to estimate the planted area with soybean culture in the crop of 2008/2009 in cities in the west of the state of Parana, in Brazil, based on the spectral dynamics of the culture and through the use of the specific system of analysis for images of Landsat 5/TM satellite. The obtained results were satisfactory, because the classification supervised by Maximum Verisimilitude - MaxVer along with the techniques of the specific system of analysis for satellite images has allowed an estimate of soybean planted area (soybean mask), obtaining values of the metrics of Global Accuracy with an average of 79.05% and Kappa Index over 63.50% in all cities. The monitoring of a reference area was of great importance for determining the vegetative phase in which the culture is more different from the other targets, facilitating the choice of training samples (ROIs) and avoiding misclassifications.

AB The generation of land-cover maps for agriculture is a recurrent problem in remote sensing. There exist many efficient algorithms, but they often need well selected images during specific periods, which delays the map availability to the end of the season. In this work, we propose to introduce prior knowledge about crop rotation and topography in order to both improve the classification and obtain an accurate map early in the year. We use a Bayesian Network to model the crop rotation and we introduce the output of the model into a Support Vector Machine classifier to generate a land-cover map. We evaluate the overall improvement and the effect on several crops.

AB Crop acreage estimation is an essential component for forecasting crop production. Menthol mint acreage estimation is a necessity as the crop production data change every year due to fluctuations in the market prices of menthol mint oil; hence, the rate available to farmers also changes every year. These acreage estimation studies would be helpful in reducing the uncertainties of menthol mint production as lower price results in low production and high price results in higher production next year. Thus, it in turn would help in stabilizing the market prices. Nowadays, remote sensing technologies due to their availability and adaptability are being widely used for crop acreage estimation nationally and internationally. This study focuses on menthol mint crop acreage estimation in the Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh, India, using 2017 Sentinel-2A satellite data. Adaptive maximum likelihood classification algorithm was applied after intensive ground survey to obtain reliable menthol mint crop acreage estimation for talukwise statistics. Results have shown that menthol mint was extensively cultivated in the Fatehpur and Barabanki taluks as compared to the Haidergarh and Ram Sanehi Ghat taluks of Barabanki district. Menthol mint crop acreage estimation in the study area was estimated to be about 58,284.70 ha with (89.13% and 87.23%; users and producer's accuracy) with overall accuracy (90.67%) and kappa value (0.844). In this study, early and late menthol mint crop acreage estimation was also attempted and it was found that about 26,123.50 ha and 29,911.40 ha were the area of early and late menthol mint, respectively. This method can be useful for localized-level crop acreage estimation from early to mature stage of menthol mint during its growing season.

AB Multitemporal remote sensing data, especially those for key phenological periods, play an important role in crop classification. However, cloudy/rainy climate conditions can easily lead to a lack of valid optical data, leading to crop classification difficulties. A general solution is taking advantage of all-weather synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. In practice, SAR and optical datasets are often applied in the agricultural field by the method of image fusion, but it is difficult to apply when the number of optical images is too small. To solve this problem, this research proposes a data-transfer and feature-optimize-based method, which deploy an RNN-based encoding-decoding network to add additional data to the 'optical' temporal features at the farmland parcel scale and improve the utilization of optical fragments. On the basis of this method, we mitigate inconsistencies in spatial scale among different datasets and optimize the time-series parameters without expert knowledge in the crop classification procedure. The experimental results illustrate the crop classification accuracy of this method, which achieves a 4.1% improvement over the traditional approach and is especially effective for dryland crops (e.g. corn and rapeseed). Thus, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined use of optical and SAR data for similar applications in cloudy/rainy mountainous areas.

AB Pakistan's agricultural system is predominately irrigated, which consumes 90% of fresh water resources and contributes 80% to the national production. It is ironic that the irrigated areas are the ones that are afflicted most by the twin menaces of waterlogging and salinity. Climate change is likely to exacerbate this soil degradation process by way of heavy rainfalls and by increased evaporation, respectively. Detection of soil salinity is usually done by laborious soil sampling. A study, to delineate surface soil salinity in the prime rice-wheat cropping area of Pakistan, was conducted. The study employed an index-based approach of using optical remote sensing data in combination with geographic information system. The effectiveness of different satellite imagery indicators was examined. Several combinations of the ratio of signals received in different spectral bands were used for development of this index. Near infrared and thermal IR spectral bands proved to be most effective as this combination helped easy detection of salt affected area from the non saline area. Results showed that 19% of the rice-wheat cropping area of Gujranwala district in Rachna Doab of central Punjab province of Pakistan is salt affected. These results are in agreement with the published survey data. Seasonal dependency of salinity was also analyzed so as to obtain correct classification.

AB Urban growth induces urban spatial expansion in many cities in China. There is a great need for up-to-date information for effective urban decision-making and sustainable development. Many researches have demonstrated that satellite images, especial high resolution images, are very suitable for urban growth studies. However, change detection technique is the key to keep current with the rapid urban growth rate, taking advantage of tremendous amounts of satellite data. In this paper, a multi-scale object-oriented change detection approach integrating GIS and remote sensing is introduced. Firstly, a subset of image is cropped based on existing parcel boundaries stored in GIS database, then a multi-scale watershed transform is carried out to obtain the image objects. The image objects are classified into different land cover types by supervised classification based on their spectral, geometry and texture attributes. Finally a rule-based system is set up to judge every parcel one by one whether or not change happened comparing to existing GIS land use types. In order to verify the application validity of the presented methodology, the rural-urban fringe of Shanghai in China with the support of QuickBird date and GIS is tested, the result shown that it is effective to detect illegal land use parcel.

AB Rice is a staple food in East Asia and Southeast Asiaan area that accounts for more than half of the world's population, and 11% of its cultivated land. Studies on rice monitoring can provide direct or indirect information on food security, and water source management. Remote sensing has proven to be the most effective method for the large-scale monitoring of croplands, by using temporary and spectral information. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform providing access to high-performance computing resources for processing extremely large geospatial datasets. In this study, by leveraging the computational power of GEE and a large pool of satellite and other geophysical data (e.g., forest and water extent maps, with high accuracy at 30 m), we generated the first up-to-date rice extent map with crop intensity, at 10 m resolution in the three provinces with the highest rice production in China (the Heilongjiang, Hunan and Guangxi provinces). Optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were monthly and metric composited to ensure a sufficient amount of up-to-date data without cloud interference. To remove the common confounding noise in the pixel-based classification results at medium to high resolution, we integrated the pixel-based classification (using a random forest classifier) result with the object-based segmentation (using a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method). This integration resulted in the rice planted area data that most closely resembled official statistics. The overall accuracy was approximately 90%, which was validated by ground crop field points. The F scores reached 87.78% in the Heilongjiang Province for monocropped rice, 89.97% and 80.00% in the Hunan Province for mono- and double-cropped rice, respectively, and 88.24% in the Guangxi Province for double-cropped rice.

AB This paper provides recommendations on how large-scale household surveys should be conducted to generate the data needed to train models for satellite-based crop type mapping in smallholder farming systems. The analysis focuses on maize cultivation in Malawi and Ethiopia, and leverages rich, georeferenced plot-level data from national household surveys that were conducted in 2018-20 and integrated with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and complementary geospatial data. To identify the approach to survey data collection that yields optimal data for training remote sensing models, 26,250 in silico experiments are simulated within a machine learning framework. The best model is then applied to map seasonal maize cultivation from 2016 to 2019 at 10-m resolution in both countries. The analysis reveals that smallholder plots with maize cultivation can be identified with up to 75% accuracy. Collecting full plot boundaries or complete plot corner points provides the best quality of information for model training. Classification performance peaks with slightly less than 60% of the training data. Seemingly little erosion in accuracy under less preferable approaches to georeferencing plots results in the total area under maize cultivation being overestimated by 0.16-0.47 million hectares (8-24%) in Malawi.

AB Satellite observations of the spectral properties of vegetation can provide insights on crop conditions and yield, and, furthermore, can monitor the impact of droughts. In the case of rainfed crops grown for self-sufficiency, a drought can result in significant human suffering, highlighting the need to understand how droughts affect the landscape in such regions. This paper uses remote sensing to assess the phenomenological impacts of two isolated droughts, distinguishing the response of different vegetation covers in semiarid developing regions where rainfed agriculture is common. Using the standardized precipitation index, one normal and two dry years were selected (2000, 2005, and 2011, respectively). An original protocol for land use land cover (LULC) classification that combines climatic, topographic, and reflectance information from 18 Landsat ETM+ images was applied to subsequently distinguish drought effects in different classes through the selected years. Finally, two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI)) were calculated to detect drought severity impacts over the different LULC classes. This approach was tested in Central Mexico and provided accurate information on the location and extent of areas affected by drought. The proposed approach can be used as a system for drought risk management in semi-arid developing regions.

AB Inshore ship detection in remote sensing images is a challenging task because of the connectivity and similarity between ships and backgrounds. The usual shape feature is not always applicable because sometimes it is hard to be extracted. In this paper, deep features extracted from a convolutional neural network (CNN) are used for inshore ship detection. In order to feed the CNN with exclusively positive and negative samples, a novel parallelogram image cropping (PIC) method is proposed. The traditional cropping method can only generate rectangle image samples along a horizontal or vertical orientation, thus ships and docks often coexist in these samples. The proposed PIC method can generate parallelogram samples that only contain single ship or dock. For a 2-class classification task, the number of neurons in fully-connected layers of the widely used CNN models is too large. Reducing the number from 4096 to 512 can improve training and detection speeds while maintaining accuracies. Experimental results on Google Earth images demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately and robustly detect inshore ships in remote sensing images.

AB Traditional methods of crop monitoring in the field need to lay various sensors and complex circuits in the field with a bad environment. Usually, the problems of time-consuming, labor-consuming, high maintenance cost and more or less damage to plants arise. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spectral imaging technology is a new and fast technology for monitoring farmland environment, which combines an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote sensing sensors, real-time image transmission and other means. It can quickly obtain real-time spectral images of farmland crops. Usually, it can analyze images to obtain the growth information of farmland crops. The application of this technology catches up with the above problems. Firstly, the spectrum imaging technology of UAV is summarized, and the advantages of UAV application are introduced. Compared with traditional satellite remote sensing monitoring platform, UAV can work at a lower altitude, i. e. 80 similar to 400 m. It can resist the disadvantage of adverse weather and clouds, and achieve fast and accurate acquisition of high-precision images. At present, the application of small UAVs at home and abroad mainly focuses on disaster monitoring, natural resources monitoring, urban planning and vegetation monitoring. In addition, due to its low cost, near real-time image acquisition and other characteristics, in the development of precision agriculture, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spectral images are more commonly used. Secondly, the characteristics and application scenarios of common spectral images are analyzed. Panchromatic images are mostly used for data fusion because of their high resolution; multispectral and hypersecretion images are combined with spectral characteristics of crops due to their abundant spectral information, which can be used for the detection of biological and chemical indicators of crops, early warning of agricultural disasters, yield prediction and fine classification mapping; and thermal infrared images can be used for monitoring field drought because they can obtain crop temperature information. Then the main application ways of UAV spectral image technology in the field are summarized. At present, the main methods of monitoring crops using UAV spectral image technology are : using spectral reflectance to construct vegetation index or red edge parameters, or studying the reflection characteristics of vegetation, constructing crop growth model, using multiple linear regression, partial least squares method, in-depth learning and other biochemical parameters of crops to establish a model for inversion.

AB Since inadequacy information from spectral characteristics for very high resolution remote sensing multispectral imagery segmentation/classification, we propose the combination of spectral feature which was extracted by a variable mean shift clustering algorithm and spatial features by Gabor filter banks and support vector machine is employed to achieve feature fusion and classification. Some issues on feature dimension reduction and parameter estimation in mean sit procedure are discussed The whole algorithm is evaluated on the synthetic texture image, which are cropped from a QuickBird image with typical land-cover types. The result show an improvement in classification of land cover classes having similar spectral surface

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), as an active remote sensing technology, is characterized by providing high-precision geographical location information. In this study, we further explored its capability in image classification over a suburban area. Firstly, full waveforms of small footprint airborne LiDAR were decomposed into discrete point clouds. During the decomposition, six parameters describing the physical interaction between laser pulse and the targets were calculated. They are amplitude, pulse width, central position, range, backscatter cross-section and backscatter coefficient. Secondly, the point clouds were interpolated into raster. Correspondingly, six high spatial resolution images (0.5 m) were produced. Three classification models namely decision tree (DT), maximum likelihood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM) were established based on these images. The objects of interest were classified into buildings, trees, bare soil and crop land. Results showed that all these three models yielded high overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. SVM performed the best with the highest overall accuracy (87.85%) and kappa coefficient (83.29%). Therefore, we came to conclude that classification models can also achieve satisfactory classification accuracy on LiDAR images as they did on common remote-sensed images. In addition, our study proved that physical information derived from waveform LiDAR showed good potential in classification. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

First, 3D kernel is designed according to the structure of multi-spectral multi-temporal remote sensing data. Secondly, the 3D CNN framework with fine-tuned parameters is designed for training 3D crop samples and learning spatio-temporal discriminative representations, with the full crop growth cycles being preserved. In addition, we introduce an active learning strategy to the CNN model to improve labelling accuracy up to a required threshold with the most efficiency. Finally, experiments are carried out to test the advantage of the 3D CNN, in comparison to the two-dimensional (2D) CNN and other conventional methods. Our experiments show that the 3D CNN is especially suitable in characterizing the dynamics of crop growth and outperformed the other mainstream methods.

AB Discriminating crops by remote sensing remains reasonably complex and expensive for many agricultural land managers. The current study was conducted to facilitate the operational use of remote sensing for field-level rice monitoring in Australia by determining (i) whether existing methods relating to simple moisture-based rice classification could be further simplified, and (ii) whether the high accuracies resulting from that moisture-based methodology could be further increased. First, the impact of removing the most complicated processing step, atmospheric correction, on rice classification accuracies was assessed for the 2000-01 summer growing season at the Coleambally Irrigation Area, New South Wales. The primary error sources of rice classification were then identified and simple rules developed in an attempt to reduce errors associated with confusion between unharvested winter cereals and flooded rice paddies early in the summer growing season. These newly defined rules were then used on imagery acquired in the subsequent summer growing season (2001-02) in order to assess their repeatability. The assessment of atmospheric correction showed that during the critical time frame associated with high rice identification (October-November), using non-atmospherically corrected data increased overall accuracy, although the improvement was small (about 1%). Overall accuracy also increased for every case tested for both growing seasons as a result of the rule-based classification ( ranging from about 1 to 14%), revealing that the methods were sufficiently repeatable. This study moves per-field rice monitoring at the Coleambally Irrigation Area closer to an operational application and shows that simple rule-based remote sensing classifications can be very effective when site practices are known.

AB Over the last several decades, remote sensing has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. The objective of this review, which summarizes the methods and the results of existing remote sensing studies, is to synthesize principle findings and assess the state of the art. We take a taxonomic approach to group studies based on location, scale, inputs, and methods, in an effort to categorize different approaches within a logical framework. We seek to evaluate the ability of remote sensing to provide synoptic and timely coverage of irrigated lands in several spectral regions. We also investigate the value of archived data that enable comparison of images through time. This overview of the studies to date indicates that remote sensing-based monitoring of irrigation is at an intermediate stage of development at local scales. For instance, there is overwhelming consensus on the efficacy of vegetation indices in identifying irrigated fields. Also, single date imagery, acquired at peak growing season, may suffice to identify irrigated lands, although to multi-date image data are necessary for improved classification and to distinguish different crop types. At local scales, the mapping of irrigated lands with remote sensing is also strongly affected by the timing of image acquisition and the number of images used. At the regional and global scales, on the other hand, remote sensing has not been fully operational, as methods that work in one place and time are not necessarily transferable to other locations and periods. Thus, at larger scales, more work is required to indentify the best spectral indices, best time periods, and best classification methods under different climatological and cultural environments. Existing studies at regional scales also establish the fact that both remote sensing and national statistical approaches require further refinement with a substantial investment of time and resources for ground-truthing. An additional challenge in mapping irrigation across large areas occurs in fragmented landscapes with small irrigated and cultivated fields, where the spatial scale of observations is pitted against the need for high frequency temporal acquisitions. Finally, this review identifies passive and active microwave observations, advanced image classification methods, and data fusion including optical and radar sensors or with information from sources with multiple spatial and temporal characteristics as key areas where additional research is needed.

AB Remote Sensing (RS) data have been increasingly applied to assess agricultural yield, production and crop condition. In tropical areas, crop dynamics are complex due to multiple agricultural practices such as irrigation, non-tillage, crop rotation and multiple harvest per year. Spatial and temporal information can improve the performance in land-cover and crop type classification tasks. In this context Deep Learning (DL) have emerged as a powerful state-of-the-art technique in the RS community. This work presents a comparative analysis of traditional and DL (supervised and unsupervised) approaches for crop classification on sequences of multitemporal optical and SAR images. Three different approaches are compared: the image stacking approach, which is used as baseline, and two DL based approaches using Autoencoders (AEs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Experiments were carried out in two datasets from two different municipalities in Brazil, Ipua in Sao Paulo state and Campo Verde in Mato Grosso state. It is shown that CNN and AE outperformed the traditional approach based on image stacking in terms of Overall Accuracy and Class Accuracy.

AB Sentinel-2 imagery is an unprecedented data source with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution in addition to free access. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data to map winter crops in the early growth stage. Analysis of three winter crop types-winter garlic, winter canola and winter wheat-was carried out in two agricultural regions of China. We analysed the spectral characteristics and vegetation index profiles of these crops in the early growth stage and other land cover types based on Sentinel-2 images. A decision tree classification model was built to distinguish the crops based on these data. The results demonstrate that winter garlic and winter wheat can be distinguished four months before harvest, while winter canola can be distinguished two months before harvest. The overall classification accuracy was 96.62% with a kappa coefficient of 0.95. Therefore, Sentinel-2 images can be used to accurately identify these winter crops in the early growth stage, making them an important data source in the field of agricultural remote sensing.

The analysis of multi bands data covering very large swath areas using iterative methods such as neural network or SVM will certainly cost much computation time. This paper addresses this problem by taking advantage from a non-iterative tuning capability of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for paddy growth stages classification using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing images. The accuracy of classification is measured by Cohen's kappa. Seven classes are used in classification, with consist of six classes for paddy growth stages and one class for dominated cloud. The contribution of this study is a new ensemble incremental approaches based on random bootstrap resampling for basic ELM (B-ELM) and Error Minimized ELM (EM-ELM) are applied to build multi-class classifier using two types of hidden nodes function, i.e. additive and radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes. The classification results were compared each other with these two types of hidden nodes. Our ensemble incremental approach successfully classify seven paddy growth stages and significantly improve the overall kappa coefficient to 10.2% higher with only in average 7 nodes addition overhead.

AB Remote sensing-based crop mapping using multispectral temporal images is a reliable source of crop status information. Reflectance in red-edge region can be incorporated in vegetation indices for better results as it heavily depends upon chlorophyll content in the leaves. This research work studies the effect of three Sentinel-2 red-edge bands on fuzzy classification of sunflower crop in Shahabad, Haryana, India. Fuzzy set theory was introduced in the image processing for handling the mixed pixel problems. Supervised modified possibilistic c-means (MPCM) classification approach has been adopted for the identification of sunflower fields due to the capability of handling outliers, noises, extraction of single crop and coincident cluster problem. Classification approach was applied on four different modified temporal vegetation indices. The modified vegetation indices are generated by taking different combinations of red and red-edge reflectance bands in a controlled manner with NIR band. The best vegetation index and suitable red-edge band for the discrimination of sunflower crop were determined. Further, optimization of temporal date images to separate mapping of early sown, middle sown and late sown fields was also identified. From the results of this study, it has been proven that for temporal datasets red-edge-based indices are better than the standard indices for distinguishing between different crops while applying the MPCM classification method.

AB Remote sensing data have been commonly used for agricultural crop monitoring. This paper was assessed the quality of using SAR and optical data fusion for maize classification. Two different SAR data sets from different sensors including dual polarization (HH and VV) X-band COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and quad polarization (HH, HV, VH and VV) C-band RADARSAT-2 images were fused with THAICHOTE (namely, THEOS, an Earth observation mission of Thailand) optical data. This paper describes a comparative study of multi-sensor image fusion techniques in order to maintain spectral quality of the fused images. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS), Brovey Transform (BT) and High-pass filter (HPF) techniques are implemented for image fusion. For the supervised classification, maximum likelihood was applied to the fused images to identify maize crop. Finally, the accuracy assessment was done by comparing maize maps generated from fused images and THAICHOTE classification. The PCA fused RADARSAT-2 with THAICHOTE images consistently provide excellent classification accuracies, well over 85%. The results obtained not only improving of the classification accuracy, but also can be identified the growing cycle of maize crop.

AB The spatial pattern and temporal variation of paddy rice fields based on remote sensing have strong effects on the allocation of agricultural water resources on a regional scale. Free Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) data have been successfully used to map paddy rice. However, due to frequent clouds and a temporal gap of 16 days, the shortage of Landsat data availability poses a great challenge to long-term paddy rice mapping. This study proposed a decision tree algorithm based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to map multi-season paddy rice in southern China. The study area is located in the Ganfu Plain Irrigation System (GFPIS), where double-cropping rice (early and late rice) and single-cropping rice (middle rice) are mixed. First, we explored the effects of the number and temporal distribution of Landsat images on the classification accuracy. With available cloud-free images in 2017, ten image combinations were set up to map rice fields using the proposed algorithm separately. Then, the algorithm was applied to map historical paddy rice planting in this study area. The results indicated that with a cropland mask, a single-date image in early rice growing season can map the total early rice with an overall accuracy varying from 82.02% to 93.26%, and the accuracy was mainly influenced by the temporal distribution of the images. In addition, through post-processing, multi-temporal images could be used to recognize early rice only, late rice only, double-cropping rice and middle rice with an overall accuracy ranging from 71.83% to 85.81%. In contrast, images in the early or late growing season without obvious vegetation characteristics may result in confusion. Two peak growing season images with obvious differences in the vegetation index played a key role in detecting different rice cropping types. In addition, when the EVI of rice was within a certain range, one or more images could achieve a similar overall accuracy. The total area of middle rice and late rice remained constant before 2001, but it changed from 10.72 x 10(4) ha in 2001 to 7.55 x 10(4) ha in 2017. Additionally, there was a twofold increase in the mapped middle rice area.

AB Remote sensing plays a significant role for crop classification. Accurate crop classification is a common requirement to precision agriculture, including crop area estimation, crop yield estimation, precision crop management, etc. This paper developed a new crop classification method involving the construction and optimization of the vegetation feature band set (FBS) and combination of FBS and object-oriented classification (OOC) approach. In addition to the spectral and textural features of the original image, 20 spectral indices sensitive to the vegetation's biological parameters are added to the FBS to distinguish specific vegetation. A spectral dimension optimization algorithm of FBS based on class-pair separability (CPS) is also proposed to improve the separability between class pairs while reducing data redundancy. OOC approach is conducted on the optimized FBS based on CPS to reduce the salt-and-pepper noise. The proposed classification method was validated by two airborne hyperspectral images. The first image acquired in an agricultural area of Japan includes seven crop types, and the second image acquired in a rice breeding area consists of six varieties of rice. For the first image, the proposed method distinguished different vegetation with an overall accuracy of 97.84% and kappa coefficient of 0.96. For the second image, the proposed method distinguished the rice varieties accurately, achieving the highest overall accuracy (98.65%) and kappa coefficient (0.98). Results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve crop classification accuracy and reduce edge effects, and that textural features combined with spectral indices sensitive to the chlorophyll, carotenoid, and Anthocyanin indicators contribute significantly to crop classification. Therefore, it is an effective approach for classifying crop species, monitoring invasive species, as well as precision agriculture related applications.

AB Accurate crop type identification and crop area estimation from remote sensing data in tropical regions are still considered challenging tasks. The more favorable weather conditions, in comparison to the characteristic conditions of temperate regions, permit higher flexibility in land use, planning, and management, which implies complex crop dynamics. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover prevents the use of optical data during large periods of the year, making SAR data an attractive alternative for crop mapping in tropical regions. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) techniques for crop recognition from multi-date SAR images from tropical regions. Three DL strategies are investigated: autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and fully-convolutional networks. The paper further proposes a post-classification technique to enforce prior knowledge about crop dynamics in the target area. Experiments conducted on a Sentinel-1 multitemporal sequence of a tropical region in Brazil reveal the pros and cons of the tested methods. In our experiments, the proposed crop dynamics model was able to correct up to 16.5% of classification errors and managed to improve the performance up to 3.2% and 8.7% in terms of overall accuracy and average F1-score, respectively.

AB Accurate, robust, timely and complete remote sensing-based crop classification results are critical to the mission of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), United States Department of Agriculture. However, due to cloud coverage and limited budget, in many cases, there are not enough quality AWiFS image data available for performing a reliable multitemporal crop classification. To solve this problem, extra image data from other sensors are sought for fusing with AWiFS images for temporal compensation while preserving the high spatial and spectral resolutions. This paper attempts to assess the crop classification accuracy enhancement with AWiFS and MODIS multisensor, multispectral and intertemporal fusion. Three different image fusion methods: principal component analysis (PCA), intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) and image band stacking (IBS) are applied to perform intertemporal image fusion between the 56m AWiFS and the 8-day composited reflectance MODIS data (Red and NIR bands only) with 250m resolution from NASA to incorporate more spectral dynamic information from MODIS images for better crop classification. To make the two-band MODIS data applicable to IHS fusion, this paper proposes a novel combined fusion process, in which the MODIS green band is replaced with the AWiFS green band to create a new multispectral image for IHS transformation. The fused image from AWiFS and MODIS images, together with the original AWiFS multispectral image, are then fed into the decision tree classifier for multitemporal crop classifications in accordance with different fusion methods and temporal combinations. The crop classification accuracies of various classification experiments are assessed with respect to different image fusion methods and different temporal combinations and compared with the reference single AWiFS classification results. The experimental results indicate that properly using the fusion of intertemporal MODIS and AWiFS data improves the crop classification accuracy in large crop area when enough fused temporal images are used.

AB Samut Songkhram is one province in Thailand which has coconut cultivation for domestic consumption and export abroad. However in the dry season, will be faced with the problem of using water due to the problem with sea water condition that raised, which the initial solution is to bring fresh water from the upper dams to push saltwater out of the area. Therefore, the data used of fresh water in the area, is important to water management in the upcoming crisis. Evalution of water requirement can assist the location of water demand in dry areas. Satellite data and ground data combined to estimate the volume of water needed. This research the assessment of water requirement for coconut cultivation is mainly aimed to determine the area of coconut growing through remote sensing technology with LANDSAT8 and assess the water demand in the coconut growing area. The result found, the area of coconut cultivation as 74876 Rai, where was analyzed by satellite data of Landsat8 with Supervised Classification method. The accuracy from interpreted data is 92 percent. The determination of water requirements for planting coconut were analyzed from the equation of Penman Monteith, average equal to 458,473,908 cubic meters. The value of Reference Crop Evapotranspiration average ETo is 3.80 mm / day and the coefficient of water use (Crop Coefficient) average Kc is 1.35. This research found the amount of coconut water needs in the early stages of growth with relatively little water demand and gradually increased, and there is no change in water usage.

AB Estimation of crop variables is necessary for crop type monitoring as well as crop yield forecast. At the present era artificial neural network methodology are widely used to the remote sensing domain for numerous applications like crop yield forecasting and crop type classification. In the present work, two neural network models namely general regression neural network (GRNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are used to estimate crop variables: leaf area index (LAI), biomass (BM), plant height (PH) and soil moisture (SM) by using ground based X-band scatterometer data. The both networks are trained and tested with X-band scatterometer data. The performance of the GRNN and RBFNN networks are found that the radial basis approach is more suitable for crop variable estimation in comparison to the GRNN approach. This work presents the applicability of neural network as an estimator and method employed could be useful to estimate the crop variables of other crops.

AB The rising food demand requires regular agriculture land-cover updates to support food security initiatives. Agricultural areas undergo dynamic changes throughout the year, which manifest varying radar backscatter due to crop phenology. Certain crops can show similar backscatter if their phenology intersects, but vary later when their phenology differs. Hence, classification techniques based on single-date remote sensing images may not offer optimal results for crops with similar phenology. Moreover, methods that stack images within a cropping season as composite bands for classification limit discrimination to one feature space vector, which can suffer from overlapping classes. Nonetheless, phenology can aid classification of crops, because their backscatter varies with time. This paper fills this gap by introducing a crop sequence-based ensemble classification method where expert knowledge and TerraSAR-X multitemporal image-based phenological information are explored. We designed first-order and higher order dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs) including an ensemble technique. The DCRF models have a duplicated structure of temporally connected CRFs, which encode image-based phenology and expert-based phenology knowledge during classification. On the other hand, our ensemble generates an optimal map based on class posterior probabilities estimated by DCRFs. These techniques improved crop delineation at each epoch, with higher order DCRFs (HDCRFs) giving the best accuracy. The ensemble method was evaluated against the conventional technique of stacking multitemporal images as composite bands for classification using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and CRFs. It surpassed MLC and CRFs based on class posterior probabilities estimated by both first-order DCRFs and HDCRFs.

AB Rice crop occupies an important aspect of food security and also contributes to global warming via GHGs emission. Characterizing rice crop using spatial technologies holds the key for addressing issues of global warming and food security as different rice ecosystems respond differently to the changed climatic conditions. Remote sensing has become an important tool for assessing seasonal vegetation dynamics at regional and global scale. Bangladesh is one of the major rice growing countries in South Asia. In present study we have used remote sensing data along with GIS and ancillary map inputs in combination to derive seasonal rice maps, rice phenology and rice cultural types of Bangladesh. The SPOT VGT S10 NDVI data spanning Aus, Aman and Boro crop season (1(st) May 2008 to 30(th) April 2009) were used, first for generating the non-agriculture mask through ISODATA clustering and then to generate seasonal rice maps during second classification. The spectral rice profiles were modelled and phenological parameters were derived. NDVI growth profiles were modelled and crop calendar was derived. To segregate the rice cultural types of Bangladesh into IPCC rice categories, we used elevation, irrigated area, interpolated rainfall maps and flood map through logical modelling in GIS. The results indicated that the remote sensing derived rice area was 9.99 million ha as against the reported area of 11.28 million ha. The wet and dry seasons accounted for 64% and 36 % of the rice area, respectively. The flood prone, drought prone and deep water categories account for 7.5%, 5.56% and 2.03%, respectively. The novelty of current findings lies in the spatial outcome in form of seasonal and rice cultural type maps of Bangladesh which are helpful for variety of applications.

AB Weed detection and classification are one of the important and crucial steps for area-specific weed control. This reduces the overall cast and the negative impact of using unnecessary herbicides on human health and crops. As the spectral similarity between weeds and crops is high, patch-based classification approaches are adopted in this letter. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and histogram of oriented gradients (HoG) methods are evaluated and compared. With the advancement in the remote sensing technologies, a large number of sensors are available which provide different number of hands with different spatial resolutions. The effect of these variations on weed identification is investigated. Experimental results show that CNN method extracts more discriminative and powerful features that lead to an accurate classification of different weeds compared to the HoG method. Analysis of the two important parameters provides guidance in choosing correct patch size, spatial resolution, and the number of bands to use when CNN is applied for accurate and efficient weed classification.

AB Remote sensing present some new challenges for deep learning, because (also to compensate the scarce detail level) multimodal, multisource and multitemporal data should be jointly exploited. For example, time series of optical multispectral/hyperspectral or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data probe different properties of the observed scene, based on their different wavelength, acquisition geometry, etc., and with possible data gaps.
   To address this task, we propose a new deep learning architecture that exploits a sequence of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). In the proposed architecture, all the data (with their spectral, spatial and temporal information) are used jointly and optimally in the sense that no imputation is enforced, but the internal weights providing the best classification results are estimated from the data themselves (hence the proposed name ODIN - Optimal Data Imputation Network).
   We have tested the proposed architecture, using Sentinel SAR and multispectral image series, on land cover and crop classification, an important remote sensing application. The obtained results are very promising, with an error rate below 1%, and show good spatial consistency without loss of spatial resolution.

ID INDEX
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with multispectral sensors are increasingly attractive in geosciences for data capture and map updating at high spatial and temporal resolutions. These autonomously-flying systems can be equipped with different sensors, such as a six-band multispectral camera (Tetracam mini-MCA-6), GPS Ublox M8N, and MEMS gyroscopes, and miniaturized sensor systems for navigation, positioning, and mapping purposes. These systems can be used for data collection in precision viticulture. In this study, the efficiency of a light UAV system for data collection, processing, and map updating in small areas is evaluated, generating correlations between classification maps derived from remote sensing and production maps. Based on the comparison of the indices derived from UAVs incorporating infrared sensors with those obtained by satellites (Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8), UAVs show promise for the characterization of vineyard plots with high spatial variability, despite the low vegetative coverage of these crops. Consequently, a procedure for zoning map production based on UAV/UV images could provide important information for farmers.

AB This study investigates land cover (LC) changes in the coastal area of Dakshina Kannada district in the state of Karnataka, South India, during the years 2004-2008 as a case study. IRS P-6, Linear Imaging Self Scanning sensor (LISS-IV) satellite images were used in the present work. Classification was carried out using artificial bee colony algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) which gave a better result compared to other traditional classification techniques. The best overall classification accuracy for the study area was achieved with an ABC classifier with an OCA of 80.35% for 2004 year data and OCA of 80.40% for 2008 year data, whereas the OCA in SVM, for the same training set is 71.42% for 2004 data and 71.38% for 2008 data on study area 1 and the results were optimised with respect to multispectral data. In study area 2, ABC algorithm achieved an OCA of 78.17% and MLC of 62.63% which was used to check the universality of the classifier. The classification results with post-classification technique for study area 1 indicate that urbanisation in the study area has almost increased twice. During the same time there is an increase in the forest plantation, agricultural plantation and a decrease in crop land and land without scrubs, indicates rapid changes in the coastal environment.

AB Precision agriculture (PA) is becoming an essential practice for the Implementation of sustainable agriculture that encompasses the efficient use of resources and a systematic crops monitoring. The increasing temporal and spatial resolution of satellite imagery, coupled with their availability and decreasing costs, create new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on different crops variables, more frequently available as ready-to-use data. The availability of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, such as the WorldView-3 (WV-3), leads to the advanced potential of satellite Remote Sensing (RS), becoming in the last decade one of the main data source in precision agriculture (PA). In the broad overview of these procedures, geographic object-based image classification (GEOBIA) techniques, gained broad interest as methods to produce geographic information in GIS-ready format. In this paper, methodologies for a semiautomatic process workflow is presented, providing olive tree crown detection in two different olive orchards in Calabria (Italy), collected by means of GEOBIA procedures, in order to investigate olive tree spectral behavior and the reliability of WW-3 derived vegetation indices (VIs). The semi-automated classification method, accomplished by imagery pre-processing steps, may constitute an operational processing chain for mapping and monitoring olive orchards at tree scale detail. Five VIs were investigated: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index 2 (MSAVI 2), Normalized Difference Red Edge Vegetation Index (NDRE), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index Improved (MCARI2), and NDVI2. The obtained results were statistically tested and their accuracy assessed. Thematic accuracy ranges from 95.33% to 96% in both study areas with an overall tree detection rate of 96.8%. Statistical analysis showed that the major differences in spectral behavior, over different plots of the investigated olive orchards, are mainly due to the component of the red-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM), where the red-edge becomes important in assessing the state of general vigor. Moreover, the proposed methodology increases the possibility of detecting tree stress at earlier stages and the benefits of using satellite-based approaches in terms of: larger area coverage, less processing and operator interaction coupled with more spectral information, thus reducing the need to collect costly reference data sampling.

AB Crop diversity (e.g. the number of agricultural crop types and the level of evenness in area distribution) in the agricultural systems of arid Central Asia has recently been increased mainly to achieve food security of the rural population, however, not throughout the irrigation system. Site-specific factors that promote or hamper crop diversification after the dissolvent of the Soviet Union have hardly been assessed yet. While tapping the potential of remote sensing, the objective was to map and explain spatial patterns of current crop diversity by the example of the irrigated agricultural landscapes of the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. Multi-temporal Landsat and RapidEye satellite data formed the basis for creating annual and multi-annual crop maps for 2010-2012 while using supervised classifications. Applying the Simpson index of diversity (SID) to circular buffers with radii of 1.5 and 5 km elucidated the spatial distribution of crop diversity at both the local and landscape spatial scales. A variable importance analysis, rooted in the conditional forest algorithm, investigated potential environmental and socioeconomic drivers of the spatial patterns of crop diversity. Overall accuracy of the annual crop maps ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 whilst the SID varied between 0.1 and 0.85. The findings confirmed the existence of areas under monocultures as well as of crop diverse patches. Higher crop diversity occurred in the more distal parts of the irrigation system and sparsely settled areas, especially due to orchards. In contrast, in water-secure and densely settled areas, cotton-wheat rotations dominated due to the state interventions in crop cultivation. Distances to irrigation infrastructure, settlements and the road network influenced crop diversity the most. Spatial explicit information on crop diversity per se has the potential to support policymaking and spatial planning towards crop diversification. Driver analysis as exemplified at the study region in Uzbekistan can help reaching the declared policy to increase crop diversity throughout the country and even beyond. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The estimation of crop water requirement (CWR) is an important aspect in efficient usage of water, especially in regions where water is scarce. This study estimates the change in agricultural land of major crops in Gujranwala District due to urbanization using remote sensing. The irrigation water demand (IWD) and irrigation cost are computed for the study years of 1992, 1995, 2000, 2008, 2014, and 2016. Wheat and rice are studied as they are the major crops grown in the district. Remote sensing image classification was used to prepare the land use maps and estimate cropping area. Evapotranspiration-based CWR was estimated using ETo calculator from FAO and crop coefficient (K-c) of each crop. Finally, using the water pricing for the province, change in cost of irrigation due to variation in IWD is computed. The results show that the urban area has doubled from 20 to 40 thousand hectares between 1992 and 2016 with the area sown under wheat and rice decreased by 10% and 19%, respectively. The CWR value for 2016 was 381 and 605 mm/season for wheat and rice, respectively. Between 1992 and 2016, IWD of wheat [measured in million acre-feet/year (MAF)] decreased from 0.83 to 0.70 whereas it reduced from 1.47 to 1.03 MAF for rice. During this period, the total cost of water (in million USD) for wheat varied between 0.65 and 0.33 and for rice varied between 1.69 and 0.84. Use of remotely sensed image displayed the spatiotemporal distribution of urban expansion as well as of wheat and rice within the district. This information can play a key role in tracking the state of agricultural activity and efficient agricultural water distribution.

AB The objective of this research was to assess the accuracy of remote sensing for detecting weed species in soybean based on two primary criteria: the presence or absence of weeds and the identification of individual weed species. Treatments included weeds (giant foxtail and velvetleaf) grown in monoculture or interseeded with soybean, bare ground, and weed-free soybean. Aerial multispectral digital images were collected at or near soybean canopy closure from two field sites in 2001. Weedy pixels (1.3 m(2)) were separated from weed-free soybean and bare ground with no more than 11% error, depending on the site. However, the classification of weed species varied between sites. At one site, velvetleaf and giant foxtail were classified with no more than 17% error, when monoculture and interseeded plots were combined. However, classification errors were as high as 39% for velvetleaf and 17% for giant foxtail at the other site. Our results support the idea that remote sensing has potential for weed detection in soybean, particularly when weed management systems do not require differentiation among weed species. Additional research is needed to characterize the effect of weed density or cover and crop-weed phenology on classification accuracies.

AB Present study evaluated the performance of artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm using different learning parameters for various crop classification in Varanasi, India. Satellite images such as Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS) IV and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were used for crop classification and comparative analysis study. The following crop such as barley, wheat, lentil, mustard, pigeon pea, linseed, corn, pea, sugarcane and other crops and non-crop such as water, sand, built up, fallow land, sparse vegetation and dense vegetation were identified in the area and classified. Results indicated a better classification accuracy of ANN algorithm for crop classification study when used with LISS-IV data in the comparison to Landsat 8-OLI multispectral satellite data. The larger values of the learning rates resulted high fluctuations and less classification accuracy using LISS-IV data, while less but nearly uniform results were found using the Landsat 8-OLI data.

AB Remote sensing data acquisition from the satellite images is very important for the scientific evaluation of land-use, monitoring changes, and to allow hest management of use of the resources. Agro-ecosystems in arid lands are very important to provide the agricultural crops that can provide food for the living population on these lands. The arid lands are covering more than 30% of the total world areas (i.e. the classification of the dry-lands, are: Hyper-arid 7.5%, Arid 12.1% and semiarid 17.7% of the total world areas lands [13,049 million hectares] in consequence)[1]. The present paper ivifl assess the agro-ecosystems in the arid zone and the effectiveness use of the remotely sensed data from satellite the images. The remote sensing data showed that the agro-ecosystems in the arid zone are very susceptible to water shortages and reduction of rainfall. Further, the arid lands are characterized with the following phenomena: 1) agriculture in most arid zone countries is the main consumer of water; 2) most arid zone countries have high population growth, and rural population densities are generally much higher than overall population densities; 3) the arid zones have a surprising diversity of agro-ecological systems, with edaphically conditions that can deviate substantially from those of surrounding areas and this is due to the mosaic of changes in the water resources: 4) the surrounding of agro-ecosystems in these areas are very highly productive due to the intensive agricultural practice and the systems of comprehensive monoculture crops which in turn to establish the high productivity; 5) because of the vulnerability of the surrounding environment in the arid regions such as winds, sand storms, heat and these environmental issues can cause damages to these ecosystems and destruction and to accelerate the degradation; and 6) The human stresses in these ecosystems further encourage the further destruction of the soil, increasing salinity in the soil andfia-ther degradation and the reduction of productivity of these agricultural ecosystems. Using of spatial analysis of the GIS systems provided the important picture of the degraded ecosystems and the impact of human pressures on these ecosystems. I believe that the research which are targeted towards data spatialization and integration of remotely sensing information, in addition to meteorological data, terrestrial ecosystems data of land cover that were measured by using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)[2] that have of IXI km and other computer models will help to alleviate the handicap of sparse data to be combined to serve the human communities in supporting the better sustainable development of valuable natural resources of the earth.

AB This research attempted to develop a damage-based crop insurance model using satellite remote sensing imagery and field surveys of flash flood regions in Bangladesh. A normalized difference water index (NDWI) was prepared from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, and inundated areas were delineated using a very high-resolution land use/land cover (LULC) map of a Survey of Bangladesh (SoB) to generate an accurate damage map for boro rice. The boro rice area damaged by flash floods in 2017 was estimated for the three most vulnerable flash flood-prone areas and sorted into high, moderate and marginal damage categories. The results of the accuracy assessment showed excellent classification performance for all classes of LULC. Analysis of the classification of the damaged area showed that the Gowainghat (44.60%) and Kulaura (69.80%) subdistricts were in the highest marginal damage category and that Tahirpur (52.92%) was in the moderate damage category. The future value of expected losses was calculated to be $536.25, $442.00, and $416.00 per hectare (ha) for high, moderate and marginal damage areas, respectively. Moreover, findings concerning the damaged-based crop insurance premium rate suggested that the higher the coverage levels were, the lower the insurance premium, and the lower the damaged class was, the lower the insurance premium rate. The lowest insurance premium rate was observed for areas with high coverage and moderate damage and was $23.82/ha, and the highest insurance premium rate was observed for areas with marginal coverage and high damage and was $39.49/ha. Evidence from the classification of damaged areas and from regression findings suggests that farmers' socioeconomic features and environmental awareness (occupation, educational level, total income, bank account ownership and awareness of climate change) are relevant to the decision to adopt a damaged-based crop insurance system. The overall results show an empirical model for flash flood occurrence over both the temporal and spatial domains, which offers an effective measure for adopting a damaged-based crop insurance model.

AB Imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral remote sensing, is concerned with the measurement, analysis, and interpretation of spectra acquired from a given scene (or specific object) at a short, medium or long distance by an airborne or satellite sensor. Analysis in a timely manner of the acquired multidimensional images allows to develop applications with high social impact, such as urban growing monitoring, crop fields identification, target detection for military and defense/security deployment, wildland fire detection and monitoring, biological threat detection, biophysical parameter estimation, or monitoring of oil spills and other types of chemical contamination.
   In this context, support vector machines (SVM) [1, 2, 3] have become one of the state-of-the-art machine learning tools for hyperspectral image classification. However, its high computational cost for large scale applications makes the use of SVM limited to off-line processing scenarios. Certainly, with the recent explosion in the amount and complexity of hyperspectral data, parallel processing has soon become a requirement in many remote sensing missions, especially with the advent of low-cost systems such as commodity clusters and distributed networks of computers In order to address this relevant issue, this chapter explores the development of two parallel versions of SVMs for remote sensing image classification.
   Sequential minimal optimization is a very popular algorithm for training SVMs, but it still requires a large amount of computation time for solving large size problems. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a parallel implementation of the SVM based on the parallelization of the incomplete Cholesky factorization and present novel parallel implementations that balance the load across the available processors through standard Master-Worker decompositions. Both methodologies are theoretically analyzed in terms of scalability, computational efficiency and time response. The impact of the multi-class scheme is also analyzed. Results on real multispectral and hyperspectral datasets illustrate the performance of the methods. We finally discuss the possibility of obtaining processing results quickly enough for practical use via the Marenostrum supercomputer available at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain, and other massively parallel facilities at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

AB Satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) have been used successfully to monitor and assess the land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and their impacts on people and the environment. LULC change detection is essential for studying spatiotemporal conditions and for proposing better future planning and development options. The current research analyzes the detection of spatiotemporal variability of spate irrigation systems using remote sensing and GIS in the Khirthar National Range, Sindh Province of Pakistan. We use Landsat images to study the dynamics of LULC using ArcGIS software and categorize five major LULC types. We obtain secondary data related to precipitation and crop yield from the provincial department of revenue. The maximum likelihood supervised classification (MLSC) procedure, augmented with secondary data, reveals a significant increase of 86.25% in settlements, 83.85% in spate irrigation systems, and 65% in vegetation, and a substantial negative trend of 39.50% in water bodies and 20% in barren land during the period from 2013 to 2018. Our study highlights an increase in settlements due to the inflow of local population for better means of living and an increase in spate irrigation systems, which indicates the water conservation practices for land cultivation and human purpose lead to the shrinkage of water bodies. The confusion matrix using Google Earth data to rectify modeled (classified) data, which showed an overall accuracy of 82.8%-92%, and the Kappa coefficient estimated at 0.80-0.90 shows the satisfactory results of the LULC classification. The study suggests the need to increase water storage potential with the appropriate water conservation techniques to enhance the spate irrigation system in the hilly tracts for sustainable developments, which mitigates drought impact and reduces migration rate by providing more opportunities through agricultural activities in the study area.

AB The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.

AB The limitations on spatial resolution and on the availability and measurement accuracy of remote sensing images are the primary problems in the estimation of the large-scale planting area for maize. The integration of mid- and low-resolution images is the one of primary methods used for the estimation of large-scale crop planting areas using remote sensing. The use of a single-temporal thematic mapper (TM) image results in a low accuracy of maize recognition, so a mid-scale time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, which was derived from the fusion of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and TM images based on the wavelet transform, was established. The planting area was estimated using the minimum distance model and the accuracy was evaluated using in-situ samples. The results show that the estimation of the maize-sown area based on the time-series NDVI information of the integrated images reached high levels of gross and position accuracy (89% and 90%), indicating that this method could fully utilize the time-series information from the MODIS images and the spatial resolution of a TM image. The use of the difference in phenophases among fall crops enables the effective classification of the spatial distribution of these crops.

AB Yield estimates and yield gap analysis are important for identifying poor agricultural productivity. Remote sensing holds great promise for measuring yield and thus determining yield gaps. Farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are commonly characterized by small field size, intercropping, different crop species with similar phenologies, and sometimes high cloud frequency during the growing season, all of which pose real challenges to remote sensing. Here, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system based on a quadcopter equipped with two consumer-grade cameras was used for the delineation and classification of maize plants on smallholder farms in Ghana. Object-oriented image classification methods were applied to the imagery, combined with measures of image texture and intensity, hue, and saturation (IHS), in order to achieve delineation. It was found that the inclusion of a near-infrared (NIR) channel and red-green-blue (RGB) spectra, in combination with texture or IHS, increased the classification accuracy for both single and mosaic images to above 94%. Thus, the system proved suitable for delineating and classifying maize using RGB and NIR imagery and calculating the vegetation fraction, an important parameter in producing yield estimates for heterogeneous smallholder farming systems.

AB The exact knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop diseases for an implementation of a site-specific fungicide application is fundamental. Remote sensing is an appropriate tool to monitor the heterogeneity of fungal diseases within agricultural sites. However, the identification of an infection at an early growth stage is essential. This study assesses the potential of multispectral remote sensing for multitemporal analyses of crop diseases. Within an experimental test site near Bonn (Germany) a 6-ha sized plot with winter wheat was created, containing crops with each possible infection stage of three different pathogens. Two multispectral QuickBird images (04/22/2005 and 06/20/2005) and a spectrally resampled HyMap image (05/28/2005) were used to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamic of infection. The data preprocessing comprised a radiometric and a precise geometric correction by using DGPS-measurements that is an important requirement for Precision Agriculture applications. Ground truth data, in particular infection severity, growth stage/height, and spectroradiometer measurements were collected. A decision tree, using mixture tuned matched filtering results and a vegetation index was applied to classify the data (infected and non-infected areas). Classification results were compared to ground truth data. The classification accuracy of the first scene was only 56.8% whereas the scene of 28 May (65.9%) and the scene of 20 June (88.6%) achieved considerably higher accuracies. The results showed that high-resolution multispectral data are generally suitable to detect in-field heterogeneities of vegetation vitality though they are only moderately suitable for early detection of stress factors.

AB With the urbanizing development of Beijing, the planting area and spatial distribution structure of Beijing suburb crops are changing constantly. Because the TM (Thematic Mapper) images of Beijing area during 2003 summer suffered from weather conditions, such as cloud or haze, it is difficult to obtain the satisfying classification with only one kind of remote sensing data. To get the first data of the exact area and spatial distribution of Beijing crops, a perfect classification strategy is designed in this paper. The images of 2003's TM/ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) in comparative better weather conditions, MODIS(Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) standard products in 2003 and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) at 30 in spatial resolution of Beijing area are adopted. The classification system for main crops in Beijing is constructed which includes winter wheat, maize, soybean, clover, garden, orchard, etc. Based on the phenological features of the main crops, the different crops extracting plan is constructed respectively. The orchard and vegetable in greenhouse planting information are from the supervised classification with maximum likelihood methods. By means of the decision tree classification function of the ENVI (The Environment for Visualizing Images) software, the winter wheat and clover planting information are extracted by the logic operation algorithm among the 4 NDVI data from the TM/ETM+ images adopted in this paper while the spring maize and soybean are extracted with the logic algorithm with MODIS NDVI. The results indicated that this classification strategy can not only improve the classification precision, but also decrease the post classification work.

AB The present study aims to quantify spatial relationship of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and land surface temperature (LST) using remote-sensing and geographical information system techniques over 10 major metropolitan cities of India. For this purpose, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images of these cities during winter period from 2001 to 2013 are used. Statistical analysis of the LULC classification has shown overall accuracy ranging between 85% and 88%. The LULC classification and estimated LST using the satellite imageries reveals the presence of multiple urban heat islands (UHIs) and their increase in number in all cities. Significant increase in built-up/urban areas are noticed at the expense of vegetated lands and barren lands over Lucknow, Nagpur, and Jaipur, whereas in Hyderabad and Bengaluru the built-up area and the dry/barren lands are observed to be increasing, at the expense of crop/grass lands. Higher UHI intensities in the range of 8.9-10.3 degrees C are noticed over Mumbai, Nagpur, and Hyderabad compared to the other cities. Higher temperature zones (hotspots) are found to be increasing in the built-up area as well as in barren lands. Varying increase in UHI intensity among the cities is noticed which may have implications in the regional climate over the cities.

AB The opportunity of regular receiving of the MODIS/TERRA radiometer data in the direct broadcast mode makes it possible to use these data as perspective information source for the detailed analysis of agricultural production on a regional scale. The most suitable MODIS/TERRA data subset for this purpose is a pair of red and NIR spectral bands with 250 m spatial resolution. The specified spectral ranges are in accordance with the well known remote sensing algorithms applied to estimate vegetation properties. In the SRIA-Centre, Rostov-on-Don supported by the Rostov region administration, techniques have been tested for several years aimed at prompt checking of winter wheat crops by the MODIS/TERRA radiometer data. The type of crops selected for the related studies is due to the large size of individual fields of winter wheat in the region. Thus, any losses of accuracy resulted from the low spatial resolution of MODIS/TERRA radiometer data are diminished. To achieve the needed accuracy, the quality assessment of land vector layers is of great importance. These vector layers are used both for registration of space images and for field masks creation during image interpretation. The vector layers have been created on the basis of the Russian high resolution space photo of the KFA-1000 starting from 1999. Thematic analysis of MODIS/TERRA radiometer data is made with use of supervised classification techniques which require to define training classes prior to execution. Training classes are determined using the selected test sites (crop fields). The numerous regular inspected test sites are sorted in various agricultural zones of the region. GPS receivers serve to make analyses of the inspected fields and probe points location. The scaling test of winter wheat crops monitoring technology was carried out in 2002. Comparison of its results and farm reports has shown a sufficient reliability of remote sensing estimations on both sizes of the areas of agricultural production and crop condition assessment. All remote sensing processing procedures are conducted by ENVI 3.5 software.

AB The task of mapping coffee crops using multispectral data sets is not yet a trivial routine. This is because coffee fields are extremely heterogeneous in terms of spectral reflectance. This study therefore aims to contribute to the mapping of coffee crops using multispectral imagery with 23.5m spatial resolution taken by the Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS III) instrument on board the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite system. The section of land covered by this study is a traditional coffee-producing province located in the south of the State of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Whereas the pixel mixture effect was managed using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), the classification was carried out using data mining (DM) techniques. The decision tree (DT) outcomes were evaluated using a simple and qualitative method based on the elements of photointerpretation. In total, eight land-use and land-cover (LULC) types were mapped, including three classes of coffee-growing land expressing different phenological conditions and management. These were named Production Coffee', Mixed Coffee', and Old/Pruned Coffee'. The results showed that the methodology was effective for mapping LULC types, as the workflow adopted simplified image interpretation and offered improvements in the classification performance. Despite the coffee-cultivation classes having a large spectral variability, which increases the chances of classification errors, not many confusions were observed involving the three coffee classes mapped with other categories of use. This therefore shows that the method was efficient in isolating the coffee classes (with an accuracy greater than 70%) from other categories of use. Comparing the results obtained in this work with a conventional maximum-likelihood (ML) classification, the results revealed that when using the methodology described, the confusions between classes were less dispersed and an improvement of approximately 10% was observed in the mapping of the Production Coffee class.

This study classified the dominant substrate of shallow water base on spatial resolution of imagery and in situ measurement and analyzed the accuration of Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery to determine health of coral reefs. The image processing are atmospheric correction, cropping, masking, Depth Invariant Index, Unsupervised classification, ground truthing, reclassify, accuracy assessment, and spectral reflectance analysis. Unsupervised classification used IsoData method with Lyzenga application to detection of coral reefs condition. Spectral measurement by spectroradiometer underwater, photo underwater, and geotagging are conduct as in situ measurement. Spectral reflectance of medium spatial resolution image and insitu measurement are integrated to discriminate of live coral, dead coral cover with algae, rubble and algae. The results of this study show a baseline for develop the Di gi t a l Coral Health Chart as an approach to determine living coral condition using remote sensing techniques. It can be used as an effective way for detecting and monitoring of dynamic changes of coral reefs on small islands in Spermonde Archipelago. Image analysis integration and in situ survey results show that rubble and dead coral with algae were indicating as coral death due to either damaging human activity and natural death.

AB Crop classification is a representative problem in multispectral remote sensing image (RSI) classification, and has significance in country food security, ecological security, production estimate, crop growth supervision, and so on. It has attracted increasing attention of many researchers around the world especially after the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN). General CNN-based multispectral RSI classification methods may be not suitable for labeled samples with limited numbers and areas. Other pixel-based classification methods are always affected by noise and ignore spatial information. Focusing on these problems, this paper presents an approach based on lightened CNN for crop classification with a small number of tiny size labeled samples in multispectral images. The contribution of this work is to construct a lightened CNN model for crop classification with small samples in multispectral image. It avoids overfitting of deep CNN and reduces the requirement for the size of training samples. We adopt two-layer fully convolutional network (FCN) to extract features. The first layer uses a convolutional kernel of size 1 and outputs 16-band feature map to obtain spectral band information. Spatial information is extracted in the sequential layer using convolutional kernel of size 3, step 1 and padding 1. Thus the feature map after FCN and the labeled area have the same size. Finally, we use a fully connected layer and a softmax classifier for classification. Our experiment was conducted on 8-band multispectral image of size 50362-by-17810 pixels. There are 5 classes in the multispectral image, namely rice, soy, corn, non-crop, and uncertainty. The experimental result which achieves 86.28% accuracy indicates the good performance of our network for crop classification in multispectral RSIs.

AB Cropping systems' maps at fine scale over large areas provide key information for further agricultural production and environmental impact assessments, and thus represent a valuable tool for effective land-use planning. There is, therefore, a growing interest in mapping cropping systems in an operational manner over large areas, and remote sensing approaches based on vegetation index time series analysis have proven to be an efficient tool. However, supervised pixel-based approaches are commonly adopted, requiring resource consuming field campaigns to gather training data. In this paper, we present a new object-based unsupervised classification approach tested on an annual MODIS 16-day composite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series and a Landsat 8 mosaic of the State of Tocantins, Brazil, for the 2014-2015 growing season. Two variants of the approach are compared: an hyperclustering approach, and a landscape-clustering approach involving a previous stratification of the study area into landscape units on which the clustering is then performed. The main cropping systems of Tocantins, characterized by the crop types and cropping patterns, were efficiently mapped with the landscape clustering approach. Results show that stratification prior to clustering significantly improves the classification accuracies for underrepresented and sparsely distributed cropping systems. This study illustrates the potential of unsupervised classification for large area cropping systems' mapping and contributes to the development of generic tools for supporting large-scale agricultural monitoring across regions.

ID CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY; MODELS
AB High food demand has led stakeholders to regularly monitor agricultural production to ensure food security and a balanced ecosystem. Agricultural areas undergo rapid changes throughout a growing season due to phenology. Crop mapping initiatives therefore require efficient and effective information gathering techniques. Remote sensing, specifically radar, offers an effective land-cover mapping platform compared to ground surveying methods. Radar is sensitive to crop physical structure and biomass/vegetation water content, i.e. dielectric property. We adopt and test the potential of the recent Sentinel 1 images for multitemporal crop classification due to its short revisit period and sufficient spatial resolution. The temporal resolution guarantees the highest temporal density of images that captures crop dynamics. However, this presents dimensionality problems in classification algorithms. Therefore, we chose dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs) and tested their robustness in high-dimensional images constrained to few training data. DCRFs are designed to incorporate spatio-temporal phenological information inherent in images during crop classification. We compare the approach to single epoch classification. Our findings indicate that DCRFs improved crop mapping accuracy in all epochs. Nonetheless, most stakeholders require seasonal crop-type statistics. Hence, we use an ensemble classifier to produce an optimal map from posterior class probabilities estimated from the sequence of images. The ensemble outperforms the conventional approach of merging multitemporal images as composite bands for classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC-stack) and mono-temporal conditional random fields. It still retains high accuracy compared to MLC-stack when subjected to high-dimensional images with fewer training data.

AB A sparse texture dictionary learning method for unsupervised land cover classification is presented. The method takes the stance that land cover in remote sensing data is best analysed in texture patches rather than localized pixels. To this end, a feature vector is designed that describes local texture information in a spatially coherent manner. This texture model is extracted for each pixel in the scene. A sparse dictionary of global texture models is then learned to characterize the underlying texture distribution of the scene in a simplified manner. An unsupervised classifier is learned using these global texture models for grouping pixels exhibiting high similarity. Being an unsupervised classifier, the class labels that are learned are unbiased toward human interpretation of the scene, and rather are learned according to the texture information. The method is validated using polarimetric SAR data over a Flevoland, Netherlands agriculture scene, but may be generalized to any remote sensing data. Promising experimental results show how the proposed method retains the spatial coherence of crops, and attains higher accuracy than recent unsupervised and supervised classification methods using the same data.

AB Crop-type classification is one of the most significant applications in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. As a remote sensing technique, PolSAR has been proved to have the ability to provide high-resolution information of illustrated objects. However, single-temporal PolSAR data are restricted to provide sufficient information for crop identification due to the complicated condition of varying morphology within various growing stages. With an increasing number of spaceborne PolSAR systems launched, a large amount of real PolSAR data are being generated and used to provide great opportunities for multitemporal analysis. The main contribution of this paper is to improve crop classification accuracy with various features of classical H/alpha parameters. First, in order to deal with dual-PolSAR data, H/alpha decomposition algorithm for quad-PolSAR is modified to suit to the case of dual polarization. Second, according to the differential scattering characteristics of main crops, a new parameter is innovatively defined to measure the differential characteristics in the H/alpha classification plane. Third, crop types are discriminated by applying a supervised classification method with the newly defined parameter. Furthermore, the correctness of the parameter is verified with simulated and real Sentinel-1 data as well as AirSAR data. Finally, the performances of the classification method are investigated by the comparison with complex Wishart, Freeman-Wishart, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Hence, the experimental results show that the proposed method and SVM classifier with the newly defined parameter have the ability to improve crop classification accuracy.

AB Remote sensing image analysis is an emerging area of research and is used for various applications such as climate analysis, crop monitoring and change detection. Hyperspectral image (HSI) is one of the dominant remote sensing imaging modalities that captures information beyond the visible spectrum. The evolution of deep learning has made a significant impact on HSI analysis, mainly for its classification. The spatial-spectral feature-based classification model improves the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, these models are computationally expensive, and redundancy exists in the spatial dimension of features. This research work proposes a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) for HSI classification. The proposed model uses principal component analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing technique for optimal band extraction from HSIs. The hybrid CNN classification technique extracts the spectral and spatial features using three-dimensional CNN (3D CNN). These features are fed into a two-dimensional CNN (2D CNN) for further feature extraction and classification. The redundancy in spatial features of the hybrid CNN model is reduced by octave convolution (OctConv) instead of standard vanilla convolution. OctConv factorizes the spatial features into lower and higher spatial frequencies, and different convolutions are performed on them based on their frequencies. The hybrid model is compared against various state-of-the-art CNN-based techniques and found that the accuracy is boosted with a lesser computational cost.

AB The application of remote sensing techniques for WPET mapping in data scarce regions is gaining more recognition since it can cover large areas with minimal field observations. Important concerns are the generation of high-resolution WPET maps and addressing the question on how accurate the results are. This study aims at high resolution (10 m) mapping and evaluation of the spatial variability of biomass, yield, ET and WPET in the Makanya river catchment using the automated Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (pySEBAL) with SENTINEL-2 and LANDSAT-8 images, local land use map and locally calibrated leaf area index (LAI) inputs. A coupled phenological variability and supervised classification approach on high resolution images generated a high accuracy LULC layer which was used to map the WPET in the agricultural lands. The pySEBAL results were evaluated in view of local information on crop yields, water allocation and agricultural management practices in the different agro-ecological zones within the catchment. Calibration of high-resolution satellite LAI generated products with error estimates within acceptable levels of uncertainty. The simulated crop yields were in agreement with reported crop yields. The results showed relatively high WPET in the highlands and low WPET in the midland and lowland areas of the catchment. The latter was attributed to high transmission losses, low irrigation efficiencies, poor agricultural practices and pest/disease attack. When applying SEBAL in African cultivated catchments, it is highly recommended to use SENTINEL-2 data in addition to LANDSAT-8, and to use local information, especially for the ground truthing of land use maps, phenology, crop practices and crop yields.

AB In recent years, analyzing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has turned into one of the challenging and interesting topics in remote sensing. Radar sensors are capable of imaging Earth's surface independently of the weather conditions, local time of day, penetrating of waves through clouds, and containing spatial information on agricultural crop types. Based on these characteristics, the main goal sought in this research is to reveal the SAR imaging data capability in recognizing various agricultural crops in the main growth season in a more clarified and detailed way by using a deep-learning-based method. In the present research, the multi-temporal C-band Sentinel 1 images were used to classify 14 major classes of agricultural crops plus background in Denmark. By considering the capability of a deep learning method in analyzing satellite images, a novel, optimal, and lightweight network structure was developed and implemented based on a combination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network. The average pixel-based accuracy and Intersection over Union obtained from the proposed network were 86% and 0.64, respectively. Winter rapeseed, winter barley, winter wheat, spring barley, and sugar beet had the highest pixel-based accuracies of 95%, 94%, 93%, 90%, and 90%; respectively. The pixel-based accuracies for eight crop types and the background class were more than 84%. The network prediction showed that in field borders the classification confidence was lower than the center regions of the fields. However, the proposed structure has been able to identify different crops in multi-temporal Sentinel 1 data of a large area of around 254 thousand hectares with high performance.

AB This paper presents a novel study: remote-sensing image translation between high-resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data through machine learning approaches. To this end, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) have been proposed with the guide of high-level image features. Efficiency of the proposed methods have been verified with different SAR parameters on three regions from the world: Toronto, Vancouver in Canada and Shanghai in China. The generated SAR and optical images have been evaluated by pixel-based image classification with detailed land cover types including: low and high-density residential area, industry area, construction site, golf course, water, forest, pasture and crops. Results showed that the translated image could effectively keep many land cover types with compatible classification accuracy to the ground truth data. In comparison with state-of-the-art image translation approaches, the proposed methods could improve the translation results under the criteria of common similarity indicators. This is one of first study on multi-source remote-sensing data translation by machine learning.

AB A large number of studies have been published addressing sugarcane management and monitoring to increase productivity and production as well as to better understand landscape dynamics and environmental threats. Building on existing reviews which mainly focused on the crop's spectral behavior, a comprehensive review is provided which considers the progress made using novel data analysis techniques and improved data sources. To complement the available reviews, and to make the large body of research more easily accessible for both researchers and practitioners, in this review (i) we summarized remote sensing applications from 1981 to 2020, (ii) discussed key strengths and weaknesses of remote sensing approaches in the sugarcane context, and (iii) described the challenges and opportunities for future earth observation (EO)-based sugarcane monitoring and management. More than one hundred scientific studies were assessed regarding sugarcane mapping (52 papers), crop growth anomaly detection (11 papers), health monitoring (14 papers), and yield estimation (30 papers). The articles demonstrate that decametric satellite sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 enable a reliable, cost-efficient, and timely mapping and monitoring of sugarcane by overcoming the ground sampling distance (GSD)-related limitations of coarser hectometric resolution data, while offering rich spectral information in the frequently recorded data. The Sentinel-2 constellation in particular provides fine spatial resolution at 10 m and high revisit frequency to support sugarcane management and other applications over large areas. For very small areas, and in particular for up-scaling and calibration purposes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are also useful. Multi-temporal and multi-source data, together with powerful machine learning approaches such as the random forest (RF) algorithm, are key to providing efficient monitoring and mapping of sugarcane growth, health, and yield. A number of difficulties for sugarcane monitoring and mapping were identified that are also well known for other crops. Those difficulties relate mainly to the often (i) time consuming pre-processing of optical time series to cope with atmospheric perturbations and cloud coverage, (ii) the still important lack of analysis-ready-data (ARD), (iii) the diversity of environmental and growth conditions-even for a given country-under which sugarcane is grown, superimposing non-crop related radiometric information on the observed sugarcane crop, and (iv) the general ill-posedness of retrieval and classification approaches which adds ambiguity to the derived information.</p>

The algorithm was tested for soybean crop identification in the Brazilian Soy Moratorium context. Probability functions were modeled based on the number of pixels within discrete intervals. The result was encouraging with overall classification accuracy greater than 80%, indicating that the method is promising also to be applied for other land use classifications.

AB The aim of this paper is to assess the accuracy of an object-oriented classification of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to map and monitor crops using 19 RADARSAT-2 fine beam polarimetric (FQ) images of an agricultural area in North-eastern Ontario, Canada. Polarimetric images and field data were acquired during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. The classification and field data collection focused on the main crop types grown in the region, which include: wheat, oat, soybean, canola and forage. The polarimetric parameters were extracted with PolSAR analysis using both the Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden decompositions. The object-oriented classification, with a single date of PolSAR data, was able to classify all five crop types with an accuracy of 95% and Kappa of 0.93; a 6% improvement in comparison with linear-polarization only classification. However, the time of acquisition is crucial. The larger biomass crops of canola and soybean were most accurately mapped, whereas the identification of oat and wheat were more variable. The multi-temporal data using the Cloude-Pottier decomposition parameters provided the best classification accuracy compared to the linear polarizations and the Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters. In general, the object-oriented classifications were able to accurately map crop types by reducing the noise inherent in the SAR data. Furthermore, using the crop classification maps we were able to monitor crop growth stage based on a trend analysis of the radar response.

AB Significant efforts have been made recently in the application of high-resolution remote sensing imagery (i.e., sub-meter) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for precision agricultural applications for high-value crops such as wine grapes. However, at such high resolution, shadows will appear in the optical imagery effectively reducing the reflectance and emission signal received by imaging sensors. To date, research that evaluates procedures to identify the occurrence of shadows in imagery produced by UAVs is limited. In this study, the performance of four different shadow detection methods used in satellite imagery was evaluated for high-resolution UAV imagery collected over a California vineyard during the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) field campaigns. The performance of the shadow detection methods was compared and impacts of shadowed areas on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and estimated evapotranspiration (ET) using the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model are presented. The results indicated that two of the shadow detection methods, the supervised classification and index-based methods, had better performance than two other methods. Furthermore, assessment of shadowed pixels in the vine canopy led to significant differences in the calculated NDVI and ET in areas affected by shadows in the high-resolution imagery. Shadows are shown to have the greatest impact on modeled soil heat flux, while net radiation and sensible heat flux are less affected. Shadows also have an impact on the modeled Bowen ratio (ratio of sensible to latent heat) which can be used as an indicator of vine stress level.

AB Depending on environmental factors fungal diseases of crops are often distributed heterogeneously in fields. Precision agriculture in plant protection implies a targeted fungicide application adjusted these field heterogeneities. Therefore an understanding of the spatial and temporal occurrence of pathogens is elementary. As shown in previous studies, remote sensing techniques can be used to detect and observe spectral anomalies in the field. In 2008, a sugar beet field site was observed at different growth stages of the crop using different remote sensing techniques. The experimental field site consisted of two treatments. One plot was sprayed with a fungicide to avoid fungal infections. In order to obtain sugar beet plants infected with foliar diseases the other plot was not sprayed. Remote sensing data were acquired from the high-resolution airborne hyperspectral imaging ROSIS in July 2008 at sugar beet growth stage 39 and from the HyMap sensor systems in August 2008 at sugar beet growth stage 45, respectively. Additionally hyperspectral signatures of diseased and non-diseased sugar beet plants were measured with a non-imaging hand held spectroradiometer at growth stage 49 in September. Ground truth data, in particular disease severity were collected at 50 sampling points in the field. Changes of reflection rates were related to disease severity increasing with time. Erysiphe betae causing powdery mildew was the most frequent leaf pathogen. A classification of healthy and diseased sugar beets in the field was possible by using hyperspectral vegetation indices calculated from canopy reflectance.

AB In this study, a machine learning based algorithm is developed for dynamically classifying and determining area of agricultural land-use using optical and active microwave remote sensing. It includes a gradient boosted machine trained in the US using labels derived from the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service crop land data layers (CDL). This is then applied to the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil with a hidden Markov model applied to temporally stabilize the land-cover predictions. High resolution remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, nadir adjusted bidirectional reflectance, land-cover and radar backscatter were used to develop the classification model. The results in the US were validated using a hold-out set with CDL labels. The results in Brazil were validated using the harvested area statistics reported by Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento.

The scientific approach concentrates on deriving physical parameters characterizing soil and vegetation by means of land use/land cover classifications using Landsat TM, IRS-1C LISS, and ERS-2 SAR data. First results are quite promising: (a) agricultural crops and Mediterranean vegetation could be classified with optical and radar data, and (b) model parameters describing the distributed features of the test basins vegetation-soil-topography interface (VSTI) could be derived.

AB With high-resolution remote-sensing data, there are numerous possible features for object description, making the selection of optimal features a time-consuming and subjective process. While substantial efforts have been made to compare the utility of feature selection metrics, less attention has been paid to the efficiency of such in the context of object-based image analysis. In this study, the statistical measurement z-score was used to ensure compatibility with objects. We assessed the feasibility of a z-score method, and then ranked and reduced input features using a backward elimination technique. The results showed that separability can be efficiently estimated based on z-score values, and the near-infrared band performed the best for crop classification. A straightforward trend was observed, and the optimal feature set was created, which was a combination of spectral, temporal, texture information and vegetation indices. These features complement one another to help increase crop map accuracy. For the 40% of the entire sample sizes, the optimal feature sets produced the best trade-off between the number of inputs and classification accuracy, with the misclassification error of 7.09%. Additionally, reliable crop maps were obtained, with the overall accuracy of 92.64%, and the z-score method showed great potential for the separability of crops at object scale using remotely sensed multi-temporal data.

AB The 10-year Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing (MARS) project, launched by EU in 1989, initiated several studies with the aim of providing technical support to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and helping the Member States' Administrations to improve and industrialise their methods using remote sensing technology. One of the main targets of the project is to provide the framework for implementation of this technology assessing the use of high resolution satellite images as part of the measures to be taken by the national governments to improve the ground survey estimates based on an area frame rather than a holding-based approach. The area frame methodology is primary used for crop area, and yield or production estimates. The statistical units (the segments) of an area frame are directly bound to a stratified geographical region, the limits of which are known in advance. Thus, the elements of the population (the frame) are also known. Since the population is stratified no segment may be shared by two or more strata. Samples are obtained by dividing a region into blocks of equal (square) shape and repeating a pattern of elements across the region. In this context, two-dimensional systematic aligned sampling methodology, with a distance threshold in a stratified area frame on a square grid, is developed. The main purpose of this paper is to review the area frame of square segments methodology when it is applied in combination with satellite imagery (also known as supervised classification), and to provide the main features that appear when it is used in agricultural statistical surveys. Further, it is to report results of area estimates obtained from the implementation of this fast acquisition statistical data methodology, using Landsat-tm images in certain cultivated Hellenic areas, particularly productive in soft and durum wheat, maize, cereals, sugar beets, cotton, tobacco, olives trees and vines. Although the results show that there is some improvement in using the supervised classification methodology, a revised stratification methodology is proposed and a new sample is extracted for the Hellenic regions of Macedonia and Thrace, using no satellite data. The new classification is simpler, easier and less costly to implement than the one that is in current use. The developed regression model provided more accurate and viable acreage estimates than a previously applied model, and it may be extended to all cultivated Hellenic regions. Finally, the acreage, yield and production estimates obtained from the supervised classification methodology are compared with those obtained from the rapid estimates methodology which was also developed in the framework of the MARS project and is reviewed here. This comparison shows a noticeable agreement in the results obtained. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents two semisupervised one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) classifiers for remote sensing applications. In one-class image classification, one tries to detect pixels belonging to one of the classes in the image and reject the others. When few labeled pixels of only one class are available, obtaining a reliable classifier is a difficult task. In the particular case of SVM-based classifiers, this task is even harder because the free parameters of the model need to be finely adjusted, but no clear criterion can be adopted. In order to improve the OC-SVM classifier accuracy and alleviate the problem of free-parameter selection, the information provided by unlabeled samples present in the scene can be used. In this paper, we present two state-of-the-art algorithms for semisupervised one-class classification for remote sensing classification problems. The first proposed algorithm is based on modifying the OC-SVM kernel by modeling the data marginal distribution with the graph Laplacian built with both labeled and unlabeled samples. The second one is based on a simple modification of the standard SVM cost function which penalizes more the errors made when classifying samples of the target class. The good performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in four challenging remote sensing image classification scenarios where the goal is to detect one of the classes present on the scene. In particular, we present results for multisource urban monitoring, hyperspectral crop detection, multispectral cloud screening, and change-detection problems. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed techniques, particularly in cases with few or poorly representative labeled samples.

AB Crop classification and mapping are important to socioeconomic, food safety, and policy-making. Accurate and timely spatial distribution of crop types based on remote sensing is important for both scientific and practical purposes. However, the existing studies mostly focused on main crops, such as winter wheat, paddy rice and some others. For the garlic crop, there is few relevant research available. So in this paper, in order to explore the feasibility of garlic extraction, a preliminary experiment of garlic mapping based on random forest (GMRF) is carried out with multi-temporal 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 images, by taking Jinxiang County, Shandong Province, China as the experimental area. The experimental results suggest that the proposed GMRF method can achieve a good performance, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.56% and a kappa coefficient of 0.967.

AB This study evaluates the impacts of three booster types (two tree-based and one linear model) in extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for crop classification using multi-temporal PolSAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. Ensemble learning algorithms have received great attention in remote sensing for classification due to their greater performance compared to single classifiers in terms of accuracy. Extreme gradient boosting is the regularized extension of traditional boosting techniques and could overcome the overfitting constrain of gradient boosting (a.k.a gradient boosting machine). Three types of booster which are linear booster, tree booster and DART (Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees) booster were tested on XGBoost for crop classification. From the multi-temporal PolSAR data, two types of polarimetric dataset (linear backscatter coefficients and Cloude-Pottier decomposed parameters) were extracted and incorporated into the classification step. The impacts of polarimetric features for crop classification were also analyzed in detailed besides exploring the boosting types of XGBoost. Our experimental results demonstrated that tree booster and DART booster were found to be superior compared the linear booster in terms of overall classification accuracy for both polarimetric dataset. The highest classification accuracy (87.97%) was achieved by tree booster with linear backscatter coefficients. Furthermore, linear backscatter coefficients achieved higher performance with respect to Cloude-Pottier decomposition in terms of classification accuracy.

AB Mapping vegetation in crop fields is an important step in remote sensing applications for precision agriculture. Traditional aerial platforms such as planes and satellites are not suitable for these applications due to their low spatial and temporal resolutions. In this article, a UAV equipped with a commercial camera (visible spectrum) was used for ultra-high resolution image acquisition over a wheat field in the early-season period. From these images, six visible spectral indices (CIVE, ExG, ExGR, Woebbecke Index, NGRDI, VEG) and two combinations of these indices were calculated and evaluated for vegetation fraction mapping, to study the influence of flight altitude (30 and 60 m) and days after sowing (DAS) from 35 to 75 DAS on the classification accuracy. The ExG and VEG indices achieved the best accuracy in the vegetation fraction mapping, with values ranging from 87.73% to 91.99% at a 30 m flight altitude and from 83.74% to 87.82% at a 60 m flight altitude. These indices were also spatially and temporally consistent, allowing accurate vegetation mapping over the entire wheat field at any date. This provides evidence that visible spectral indices derived from images acquired using a low-cost camera onboard a UAV flying at low altitudes are a suitable tool to use to discriminate vegetation in wheat fields in the early season. This opens the doors for the utilisation of this technology in precision agriculture applications such as early site specific weed management in which accurate vegetation fraction mapping is essential for crop-weed classification.

AB Rice is a staple food crop for the majority of the world's population, yet paddy fields are threatened by urban expansion, climate change, and degraded agricultural land. Vietnam, one of the largest exporters of rice globally, grows most of its rice in the Mekong River Delta, but this low-lying and heavily populated area is susceptible to major land cover changes. To properly monitor and manage rice crops in this region, remote sensing with satellite imagery has been particularly useful; however, most efforts to map regional paddy area utilize coarse resolution MODIS or AVHRR data due to their high temporal frequency. Because the average size of a rice paddy field in the region is smaller than a coarse resolution pixel, we map the Mekong study area using finer-scale Landsat data collected across multiple growing seasons. First, we exploit dense landsat time stacks for circa 2000 and circa 2010 to map rice paddy extent using vegetation trajectories, then combine these pixel-based rice maps with image-based segments to generate a polygon-based rice map. The results show that this method can map rice paddies with over 90% overall accuracy (and errors of omission and commission ranging from 6 to 25%) at a finer spatial resolution than previous efforts. Next, we differentiate between single-, double-, and triple-cropped rice paddies in the delta using a supervised classification based on exemplars of these different cropping trends. From circa 2000 to circa 2010, we find that triple-cropped rice fields have nearly doubled in area from one-third to nearly two-thirds of paddy area. Our work also highlights the importance of scenes that capture flooded fields, and the utility of cloud-covered scenes within the dense time stacks of data, to achieve higher classification accuracies. Methods to map rice paddies are vital to understanding the sustainability of these agricultural systems, and the work presented here makes strides toward routine monitoring at a field-level resolution.

AB Citrus is an important cash crop in the world, and huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease in the citrus industry. To efficiently detect the degree of HLB stress on large-scale orchard citrus trees, an UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) hyperspectral remote sensing tool is used for HLB rapid detection. A Cubert S185 (Airborne Hyperspectral camera) was mounted on the UAV of DJI Matrice 600 Pro to capture the hyperspectral remote sensing images; and a ASD Handheld2 (spectrometer) was used to verify the effectiveness of the remote sensing data. Correlation-proven UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data were used, and canopy spectral samples based on single pixels were extracted for processing and analysis. The feature bands extracted by the genetic algorithm (GA) of the improved selection operator were 468 nm, 504 nm, 512 nm, 516 nm, 528 nm, 536 nm, 632 nm, 680 nm, 688 nm, and 852 nm for the HLB detection. The proposed HLB detection methods (based on the multi-feature fusion of vegetation index) and canopy spectral feature parameters constructed (based on the feature band in stacked autoencoder (SAE) neural network) have a classification accuracy of 99.33% and a loss of 0.0783 for the training set, and a classification accuracy of 99.72% and a loss of 0.0585 for the validation set. This performance is higher than that based on the full-band AutoEncoder neural network. The field-testing results show that the model could effectively detect the HLB plants and output the distribution of the disease in the canopy, thus judging the plant disease level in a large area efficiently.

AB Geospatial analysis using remote sensing data has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. Humid and heterogeneous landscapes such as those in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain are challenging for satellite image classification over large spatial extents. The objectives of this study are to: 1) compile relevant vegetation indices for mapping and quantifying irrigated and dryland agricultural areas across the coastal plain region of South Carolina, USA; 2) identify the spatial and temporal change of the agricultural irrigation areas in the region over time; 3) compare the results to county-level statistics reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the study area. In this study, a framework has been developed to regularly monitor irrigated agriculture's extent and distribution using high-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery for the coastal plain of South Carolina region using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The maps were produced using random forest supervised classification for three years with overall accuracy assessments of 83.73% (2016), 86.18% (2017), and 84.55% (2018). The major irrigated crops in the study area are corn, cotton, soybeans, and peanuts. Overall, the irrigated crops' distribution areas were mainly concentrated in counties near the center of the studied region. The produced maps will provide valuable information for the development of irrigated agriculture and the optimization of irrigation water use in the region. The methodology followed in this study can be applied to any other regions around the world with similar landscapes and climatic conditions.

AB Space-earth integrated stereoscopic mapping promotes the progress of earth observation technologies. The method which combined remote sensing images with zenith perspectives and ground-level landscape photos with slanted viewing angles improves the efficiency and accuracy of land surveys. Recently, numerous efforts have been devoted to combining deep learning and remote sensing images for the classification of land use scenes. However, improvement of classification accuracy has been limited because of the lack of sectional representation. Landscape photos can describe the cross-sections in detail. For this reason, this study constructed a land-use semantic photo dataset (LSPD) and proposed a land-use classification framework for photos (LUCFP) based on Inception-v4. LSPD was constructed through semantic planning, scene segmentation, supervised iteration transfer learning, and augmentation of photos. LSPD has 1.4 million photos collected from seven geographic regions of China, and covers 13 land-use categories and 44 semantic categories. LUCFP adapts scene segmentation based on depth of field, multisemantic block labeling, and weighting of semantic joint spatial ranges to determine the land use category. To validate LUCFP, nine semantic samples (9x3x2000 photos) were chosen from LSPD, obtaining an overall accuracy of 97.64%. The best photo cropping method was masking, which crops the boundary of the scene labeled by the photo, leading to an accuracy of 90.32%. The optimal pixel size that balances speed and accuracy is 675x675, with speed reaching 30 photos per second with an average accuracy of 93.80%. LUCFP has been successfully applied to the automatic verification of land surveys in China.

AB In some practical classification applications, our focus may be just a specific crop (e.g., rice, corn, or soybean). Therefore, how to distinguish the crop of interest from other classes accurately and quickly is an issue worth studying. We propose an approach that combines whitening transformation (WT)/interest-class-based whitening transformation (ICWT) and one-class classification (OCC) methods to identify the crop of interest. The image created by applying WT/ICWT to the original image is referred to as the totally/partially whitened image, respectively. Three typical OCC classifiers-one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), positive and unlabeled learning (PUL), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt)-are trained to identify the crop of interest, using a totally/partially whitened image. The research results demonstrate that (1) both ICWT and WT enabled OCSVM to improve the producer's accuracy of the crop of interest by more than 20%, and the performance of the proposed approach reached or surpassed that of conventional supervised methods; (2) PUL and MaxEnt performed better than OCSVM, especially in identifying local major crops using different phased data; and (3) the proposed approach is efficient in single crop identification with remote sensing imagery and is worth recommending for practical applications.

AB Neural networks have been known for its classification capability and have been used quite extensively in pixel classification for remote sensing in recent years. In this paper we propose the use of Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural networks to evaluate the centers for the hidden neurons in RBF neural networks for pixel classification. The combined use of both neural networks leads to a much better classification than the use of only one of the two networks. For the experimental study the image data considered is from both SAR and ATM sensors and for each pixel the combined data form a 15 dimensional feature vector. Five pattern classes are defined for 5 crops. The use of SOFM alone provides only 62.7% correct at best. If only RBF network is used the best reported performance is 89.5% correct. However by combining SOFM and RBF, the best average performance is 95.15% correct, a dramatic improvement over the use of either network. Performance degradation is about 5% if we use only the SAR data. This points to the needs for the data level fusion for most effective pixel classification. Performance comparison is also made with the traditional k-nearest neighbor decision rule which provides 86.5 correct. The results clearly demonstrate the advantage of multi-sensor remote sensing using neural networks.

AB Timely and accurate estimation of the area and distribution of crops is vital for food security. Optical remote sensing has been a key technique for acquiring crop area and conditions on regional to global scales, but great challenges arise due to frequent cloudy days in southern China. This makes optical remote sensing images usually unavailable. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) could bridge this gap since it is less affected by clouds. The recent availability of Sentinel-1A (S1A) SAR imagery with a 12-day revisit period at a high spatial resolution of about 10 m makes it possible to fully utilize phenological information to improve early crop classification. In deep learning methods, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM RNNs), and gated recurrent unit RNNs (GRU RNNs) have been shown to efficiently extract temporal features for classification tasks. However, due to the complexity of training, these three deep learning methods have been less used in early crop classification. In this work, we attempted to combine them with an incremental classification method to avoid the need for training optimal architectures and hyper-parameters for data from each time series. First, we trained 1D CNNs, LSTM RNNs, and GRU RNNs based on the full images' time series to attain three classifiers with optimal architectures and hyper-parameters. Then, starting at the first time point, we performed an incremental classification process to train each classifier using all of the previous data, and obtained a classification network with all parameter values (including the hyper-parameters) at each time point. Finally, test accuracies of each time point were assessed for each crop type to determine the optimal time series length. A case study was conducted in Suixi and Leizhou counties of Zhanjiang City, China. To verify the effectiveness of this method, we also implemented the classic random forest (RF) approach. The results were as follows: (i) 1D CNNs achieved the highest Kappa coefficient (0.942) of the four classifiers, and the highest value (0.934) in the GRU RNNs time series was attained earlier than with other classifiers; (ii) all three deep learning methods and the RF achieved F measures above 0.900 before the end of growth seasons of banana, eucalyptus, second-season paddy rice, and sugarcane; while, the 1D CNN classifier was the only one that could obtain an F-measure above 0.900 for pineapple before harvest. All results indicated the effectiveness of the solution combining the deep learning models with the incremental classification approach for early crop classification. This method is expected to provide new perspectives for early mapping of croplands in cloudy areas.

DE small area; multi-level; crop acreage estimation
ID LAND-COVER; INCOME; ERROR
AB The planted acreage estimation for major crops by using remote sensing is typically combine the sample data from ground survey with information derived from image classification, and the common applied approaches are regression estimator by using linear model and calibration estimator by using confusion matrix. In general, the crop acreage estimation for provincial level in China only satisfied the precision for the target population and could not disaggregate to small areas, such as county and town level statistics. In recent years, the small area estimation is extended its application to agricultural statistics, so that by building a small area model it is applicable to estimate the sub-population or domains. This paper is adopted small area estimation approach to estimate crop acreage at county level in Heilongjiang province, China by combining image classification and ground survey data of year 2011. First, the scheme of sample selection for ground survey and method of remote sensing classification for crops in Heilongjiang province is introduced. Historical Landsat TM images in recent years are used to extract cropland to construct area frame, and then a stratified two stage sampling is adopted to select samples for ground survey. Some real Landsat TM images in early August of year 2011 as a key phenological period are used to discriminate major crops(corn, rice and soybean) by ML for entire province. Second, for the purpose of multi-level crop acreage estimation, we expect that the aggregation of county level estimates are equal to the estimate for entire province based on regression estimation. To meet this constraint, this paper is adopted a basic level small area model with fixed effects so that the sum of county estimates could be added up to the estimate of provincial total. The fitted model in the case of Heilongjiang province is in the form of a multi-response multiple regression. Third, the precision in terms of MSE of the estimates for corn, rice and soybean derived from small area model are illustrated, the coefficient of variation of estimates for these three major crops on county level average are relatively small and acceptable in practice. Finally, we discuss the model fitness of small area model, which are relevant to sample design for ground survey and form of model setting. In conclusion, it is efficient and robust to estimate sub-provincial crop acreage by adopting small area model if model itself is statistical sounding.

AB Interannual variation in rainfall throughout Tamil Nadu has been causing frequent and noticeable land use changes despite the rapid development in groundwater irrigation. Identifying periodically water-stressed areas is the first and crucial step to minimizing negative effects on crop production. Such analysis must be conducted at the basin level as it is an independent water accounting unit. This paper investigates the temporal variation in irrigated area between 2000-2001 and 2010-2011 due to rainfall variation at the state and sub-basin level by mapping and classifying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day composite satellite imagery using spectral matching techniques. A land use/land cover map was drawn with an overall classification accuracy of 87.2 %. Area estimates between the MODIS-derived net irrigated area and district-level statistics (2000-2001 to 2007-2008) were in 95 % agreement. A significant decrease in irrigated area (30-40 %) was observed during the water-stressed years of 2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 2009-2010. Major land use changes occurred three times during 2000 to 2010. This study demonstrates how remote sensing can identify areas that are prone to repeated land use changes and pin-point key target areas for the promotion of drought-tolerant varieties, alternative water management practices, and new cropping patterns to ensure sustainable agriculture for food security and livelihoods.

ID CROP GROWTH
AB Monitoring rice growth and yield estimation using optical remote sensing data constitutes a big challenge largely due to cloud conditions that are typical of tropical regions. Using Radar remote sensing data helps because it overcome the cloud issue and as well distinguishes the behaviour of the radar backscattering of rice crops specifically. This study indicated the temporal change of rice backscatter (sigma degrees) at two different growth stages using HH polarimetric Radarsat-2. The aims of this study are: (1) to identify crop with different life spans based on the backscatter coefficient's values from a single polarisation for understanding the backscatter characteristic of rice over the entire growth cycle, and (2) to understand the advantages and limitations using the RADARSAT-2, C band with HH polarisation. The values of backscattering coefficients have been related to the Malaysia rice crop calendar to get the information of the growth status. The result shows strong backscatter coefficient values on the 21st of May that referred to the reproductive-maturity of rice in the Sawah Sempadan area, and out of season for the Sungai Burong area. While for the August 1st imagery, the result shows weak backscatter values which refers to early vegetative and vegetative-reproductive. The values of backscattering coefficient are found to be much less for early vegetation compare to mature rice crop. In this paper, we have also performed a classification of a rice field using Landsat 8 OLI.

AB The Remote Sensing Centre in the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography has undertaken the investigation of applying ENVISAT.ASAR, ALOS.PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X data for modelling of soil moisture under various crops. Radar data are independent of weather conditions and that is why they are very useful in monitoring the dynamic of various soil-vegetation parameters. The aim of the study was to examine the usefulness of radar data for describing the soil-vegetation parameters of agri-environment ecosystem in the Wielkopolska region of Poland. The research on agriculture area has been carried out at ground level by taking measurements of soil moisture, Leaf Area Index, height of the vegetation, and wet and dry biomass. The TerraSAR-X and ALOS.PALSAR images have been applied for classification of agriculture area. The images taken in X band were used for discriminating the structure of vegetation, while the images taken in L-band turned out to be very effective at mapping structure of forests and distinguishing them from non-forest areas. Therefore synergy of images acquired in bands X and L gave good results in classification of forested areas and crops. The influence of soil moisture on backscattering coefficient calculated from ENVISAT.ASAR under various polarisations and incidence angles for different crops distinguished from classification of ENVISAT.ASAR IS6 and IS4 has been examined to find correlations between satellite derived data and soil-vegetation parameters. The best correlation between backscatter and LAI has been obtained by applying ASAR IS6 HH or ASAR 154 HH images, while the best correlation between backscatter and soil moisture has been obtained applying ASAR IS6 VV or ASAR IS4 VV images. The influence of the crop descriptor such as LAI on backscatter coefficient calculated from ENVISAT.ASAR 152 HH under various soil moisture conditions as well as the influence of the crop descriptor such as soil moisture on backscatter coefficient calculated from ENVISAT.ASAR 152 HV under various LAI conditions was examined for wheat using the "water-cloud model". The relationships between modelled values of soil moisture and LAI and measured values have been derived and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate information regarding the structure of crops is critical for the improvement and optimization of land surface models. Multitemporal remote sensing imagery is more effective to determine the crop structure than the single-temporal images because they contain phenological information. Crop structure was extracted based on time series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in the middle Heihe River Basin. A time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with a 3-day temporal resolution was composed based on daily MODIS reflectance products (MOD 09) from January to December 2011. A total of 120 scenes of composited imagery were integrated into an image data cube of NDVI time series, which was used to extract crop structure for the study area. The spectral curves of corn, wheat, rape, vegetables, and other crops are based on both in situ measurements and visual interpretation. The major crop types were classified by using the adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. The results show that the classification accuracy of Adaboost and SVM was 86.01% and 70.28%, respectively, with Kappa coefficients of 0.8351 and 0.6438, respectively. Summarizing the classification methods used in this study effectively characterize the spatial distribution of the main crops. (c) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Accurate information on the extent of waterlogging is required for flood prediction, monitoring, relief and preventive measures. The rule-based classification algorithms were used for differentiating waterlogged areas from other ground features using Resourcesat-2 AWiFS satellite imagery (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite with spatial resolution of 56m). Two spectral indices normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were used for extracting waterlogged areas in Sri Muktsar Sahib district of Punjab, India. These indices extracted the waterlogged areas (cropped areas inundated with water) but the water features were less enhanced in the NDWI-derived image (when compared with MNDWI-derived image) due to negative values of NDWI and, mixing of water with built up features. The water features were more enhanced with MNDWI and the values of MNDWI were positive for water features mixed with vegetation. The overall accuracy of waterlogged areas extracted from the MNDWI image was 96.9% with the Kappa coefficient of 0.89. The digital elevation model (DEM) was extracted from ASTER-GDEM. The relationships among depth to the water table recorded before the incessant rain in the region, DEM and classified MNDWI images explained the differences in the extent of waterlogging in various directions of the study area. These results suggest that MNDWI can be used to better delineate water features mixed with vegetation compared to NDWI.

AB Intensive paddy cropping in Java island has an intricate pattern both in spatial and temporal distribution due to landscape and scheduling complexity, in this case the temporal pattern is a key factor in predicting the paddy cropping season. Cropping pattern relevant to the temporal vegetation indices which can be obtained from MODIS temporal imagery. Monitoring of the cropping pattern is a critical factor in preserving the national food security of Indonesia. Remote sensing can be used as an alternative solution to monitor paddy cropping pattern by incorporating statistics analysis and signal processing methods into pre-processing and classification techniques. The main focus of this research is to evaluate the combination of those techniques implemented in MODIS images to classify the annual cropping patterns of paddy crop in Java island. The evaluated techniques involve combinations of four parameters including (1) temporal reconstruction (R0: untreated; R1: linear interpolation), (2) noise reduction (F0: untreated; F1: band-pass FFT; F2: wavelet filter), (3) unsupervised k-means classification using distance parameters (D1: Euclidean; D2: Mahalanobis), and (4) k number of classes (64, 128, 256). The classification validation was evaluated based on the paddy field site visit in several locations across Java island from the years of 2014 until 2017. The best combination (R1-F1-D1-256, the score of 74.5) was determined by the average score calculated from overall classification accuracy, percentage normality of class member, and the average correlation of class member. This combination can describe the highest number of cropping patterns (i. e., 26 patterns) that cover four types of paddy cropping systems (i.e., non-paddy, single paddy cropping, double paddy cropping, and triple paddy cropping). This selected technique can also be used to calculate the annual paddy cropping area.

AB Aerial imagery is important in remote sensing applications. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a wide range of applications in remote sensing and presents a substantial cost-effective solution when monitoring objects on the earth's surface. Moreover, object detection and classification are important aspects of global information system, especially for remote sensing applications and power line monitoring, which are essential for the proper distribution of electricity to consumers. Manual inspection consumes much time and involves risk, especially in remote areas that host dangerous wildlife; hence, UAV-based approaches are more feasible for such monitoring. The authors propose an UAV approach that utilises a digital surface model and incorporates a stereo matching algorithm based on UAV stereo images. The proposed algorithm was based on a graph-cut (GC) algorithm that measured the disparity map. Results were compared with well-known algorithms; including, for example, global and local stereo matching algorithms. The proposed solution introduces and integrates ordering constraints along with a submodular energy minimisation function to/with the GC algorithm to enhance performance. The authors measured sensitivity and recall for all parameters against ground truth data for differently cropped images of 16 power poles. Results showed that the proposed model performed more accurately compared to extant methods.

AB In order to exploit remote sensing data operationally for precision agriculture applications, efficient and automated methods are required for the accurate detection of vegetation, crops and different crop varieties. To this end, we have designed, developed and evaluated an object-based classification framework towards the detection of vineyards, the vine canopy extraction and the vine variety discrimination from very high resolution multispectral data. A novel set of spectral, spatial and textural features, as well as rules, segmentation scales and a set of parameters are proposed based on object-based image analysis. The validation of the developed methodology was carried out on multitemporal WorldView-2 satellite data at four different viticulture regions in Greece. Concurrent in situ canopy reflectance observations were acquired from a portable spectroradiometer during the field campaigns. The performed quantitative evaluation indicated that the developed approach managed in all cases to detect vineyards with high completeness and correctness detection rates, i.e., over 89%. The vine canopy extraction methodology was validated with overall accuracy (OA) rates of above 96%. The quantitative evaluation regarding the vine variety discrimination task, including experiments with up to six different varieties, reached OA rates above 85% at the parcel level. The combined analysis of the experimental results with the spectral signatures from the in situ reflectance data indicated that certain vine varieties (e.g., Merlot) presented distinct spectral patterns across the VNIR spectrum.

DE agriculture; drought; early warning; decision support system
AB Real time monitoring of vegetation conditions is of paramount importance, particularly for food insecure countries, to detect possible crop and pastures production drops as early as possible. This monitoring is classically based on remote sensing indicators of vegetation conditions (typically NDVI and rainfall produced every ten days at a resolution of 1 km or more) and many web portals now offer anomaly maps and time profiles derived from these indicators; however, timely and coherent interpretation of this coarse resolution information at global scale remains challenging. With the ASAP system (Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production) we propose a two-step analysis to provide every month warning of production deficits in water limited agricultural systems. The first step is fully automated and classifies each Gaul 1 unit (i.e. first sub-national administrative level) according to a warning scale. These warnings are triggered only during the crop/pasture growing season, as derived from a remote sensing based phenology. For each Gaul 1 unit, the classification takes into consideration its fraction of agricultural area affected by a severe anomaly for two rainfall-based indicators and one biomass indicator, as well as timing in the crop cycle at which the anomaly occurs. In the second step, agricultural analysts check the automatic warnings to identify the countries which qualify as "hot spot" because of their potentially critical conditions. The system elaborates the warnings for the whole globe but the analysts focus on 80 food insecure countries in Africa, Asia and America. In their evaluation, the analysts are assisted by graphs and maps automatically generated in the first step, agriculture and food security-tailored media analysis and high resolution imagery (e.g. Landsat 8, Sentinel 1 and 2) processed with Google Earth Engine. Maps and statistics, accompanied by short narratives are then published on the website and can be used directly by food security analysts with no expertise in crop monitoring with remote sensing, or can contribute to global early warning bulletins such as the GEOGLAM Early Warning Crop Monitor, which synthesizes every month crop conditions analysis from various institutions.

AB The rapid increase in urbanization has an important effect on cropping pattern and land use/land cover (LULC) through replacing areas of vegetation with commercial and residential coverage, thereby increasing the land surface temperature (LST). The LST information is significant to understand the environmental changes, urban climatology, anthropogenic activities, and ecological interactions, etc. Using remote sensing (RS) data, the present research provides a comprehensive study of LULC and LST changes in water scarce and climate prone Southern Punjab (Multan region), Pakistan, for 30 years (from 1990 to 2020). For this research, Landsat images were processed through supervised classification with maps of the Multan region. The LULC changes showed that sugarcane and rice (decreased by 2.9 and 1.6%, respectively) had less volatility of variation in comparison with both wheat and cotton (decreased by 5.3 and 6.6%, respectively). The analysis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the vegetation decreased in the region both in minimum value (-0.05 [1990] to -0.15 [2020]) and maximum value (0.6 [1990] to 0.54 [2020]). The results showed that the built-up area was increased 3.5% during 1990-2020, and these were some of the major changes which increased the LST (from 27.6 to 28.5 degrees C) in the study area. The significant regression in our study clearly shows that NDVI and LST are negatively correlated with each other. The results suggested that increasing temperature in growing period had a greatest effect on all types of vegetation. Crop-based classification aids water policy managers and analysts to make a better policy with enhanced information based on the extent of the natural resources. So, the study of dynamics in major crops and surface temperature through satellite RS can play an important role in the rural development and planning for food security in the study area.

AB Crop identification is key to global food security. Due to the large scale of crop estimation, the science of remote sensing was able to do well in this field. The purpose of this study is to study the shortcomings and strengths of combined radar data and optical images to identify the type of crops in Tarom region (Iran). For this purpose, Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 images were used to create a map in the study area. The Sentinel 1 data came from Google Earth Engine's (GEE) Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) product. Sentinel 1 radar observations were projected onto a standard 10-m grid in GRD output. The Sen2Cor method was used to mask for clouds and cloud shadows, and the Sentinel 2 Level-1C data was sourced from the Copernicus Open Access Hub. To estimate the purpose of classification, stochastic forest classification method was used to predict classification accuracy. Using seven types of crops, the classification map of the 2020 growth season in Tarom was prepared using 10-day Sentinel 2 smooth mosaic NDVI and 12-day Sentinel 1 back mosaic. Kappa coefficient of 0.75 and a maximum accuracy of 85% were reported in this study. To achieve maximum classification accuracy, it is recommended to use a combination of radar and optical data, as this combination increases the chances of examining the details compared to the single-sensor classification method and achieves more reliable information.

AB The role of remote sensing in phenological studies is increasingly regarded as a key in understanding large area seasonal phenomena. This paper describes the application of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data for vegetation classification using seasonal variation patterns. The vegetation seasonal variation phase of Seoul and provinces in Korea was inferred using 8 day composite MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) dataset of 2006. The seasonal vegetation classification approach is performed with reclassification of 4 categories as urban, crop land, broad-leaf and needle-leaf forest area. The BISE (Best Index Slope Extraction) filtering algorithm was applied for a smoothing processing of MODIS NDVI time series data and fuzzy classification method was used for vegetation classification. The overall accuracy of classification was 77.5% and the kappa coefficient was 0.61%, thus suggesting overall high classification accuracy.

AB The present study revealed how local socioecological knowledge elucidated during participatory rural appraisals and historical remote sensing data can be combined for analyzing land use change patterns from 1954 to 2007 in northwestern Vietnam. The developed approach integrated farmer decision rules on cropping preferences and location, visual and supervised classification methods, and qualitative information obtained during various forms of participatory appraisals. The integration of historical remote sensing data (aerial photo, Landsat, LISS III) with farmer decision rules showed the feasibility of the proposed method to explain crop distribution patterns for the assessment period of 53 years. Our approach is beneficial for data-limited environments, which is a prevalent situation for many developing regions. The derived land use and crop type dataset was used for understanding how anthropogenic activities altered the study area of the Chieng Khoi commune during the assessment period of five decades, and what potential impact this can have on the natural resource base. The newly developed approach offers a methodological pathway that can be easily transferred to local government authorities for a better understanding of cropping transitions and agricultural expansion trends in data-limited rural landscapes. The detected land use change patterns and upland cropping expansion of more than two hundred percent in 53 years not only revealed the consequences of the interactions and feedback between farmers and their land, but further highlighted the urgent need for implementing sustainable land management practices in the case study watershed of the Chieng Khoi commune and northwestern Vietnam in general.

AB The high precision land cover classification products has a very important significance for the study of quantitative remote sensing and remote sensing applications. Now there has a lot of free and global coverage land classification products, which is mostly developed by foreign research institutions and personnel. Due to the China regional complex terrain, differences in vegetation structures and in crop planting structures have not been fully studied, the classification accuracy of these products in the area of China is very low, especially the vegetation classification accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary to produce a vegetation type classification product of China region. So according to Chinese regional topography, soil and other information, and based on existing vegetation regionalization, we developed a method of Chinese vegetation classification based on vegetation partition. This method is based on long time series, which can capture the surface information changed with time with the high time resolution, and can improve the classification accuracy by the differences in the time dimension of the object. And we complete the 2012 national land cover classification by using the method. At last, the method of stratified random sampling was carried out to assess the accuracy of the classification results, found that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the classification products is greatly improved, which the overall accuracy was 90.78%, Kappa coefficient was 0.86. And the product was compared with the MODIS land cover data products, found that the accuracy of this product increased by 61.38% in vegetation than the MODIS land cover data product.

AB Crop type classification is essential for supporting agricultural decisions and resource monitoring. Remote sensing techniques, especially using hyperspectral imagery, have been effective in agricultural applications. Hyperspectral imagery acquires contiguous and narrow spectral bands in a wide range. However, large dimensionality results in unreliable estimates of classifiers and high computational burdens. Therefore, reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery is necessary. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was utilized for dimensionality reduction as well as classification purpose. RF is an ensemble-learning algorithm created based on the Classification and Regression Tree (CART), which has gained attention due to its high classification accuracy and fast processing speed. The RF performance for crop classification with airborne hyperspectral imagery was assessed. The study area was the cultivated area in Chogye-myeon, Habcheon-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, where the main crops are garlic, onion, and wheat. Parameter optimization was conducted to maximize the classification accuracy. Then, the dimensionality reduction was conducted based on RF variable importance. The result shows that using the selected bands presents an excellent classification accuracy without using whole datasets. Moreover, a majority of selected bands are concentrated on visible (VIS) region, especially region related to chlorophyll content. Therefore, it can be inferred that the phenological status after the mature stage influences red-edge spectral reflectance.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether remotely sensed data could be used to identify rice-related malaria vector breeding habitats in an irrigated rice growing area near Niono, Mali. Early stages of rice growth show peak larval production, but Landsat sensor data are often obstructed by clouds during the early part of the cropping cycle (rainy season). In this study, we examined whether a classification based on two Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+ scenes acquired in the middle of the season and at harvesting times could be used to map different land uses and rice planted at different times (cohorts), and to infer which rice growth stages were present earlier in the season. We performed a maximum likelihood supervised classification and evaluated the robustness of the classifications with the transformed divergence separability index, the kappa coefficient and confusion matrices. Rice was distinguished from other land uses with 98% accuracy and rice cohorts were discriminated with 84% accuracy (three classes) or 94% (two classes). Our study showed that optical remote sensing can reliably identify potential malaria mosquito breeding habitats from space. In the future, these 'crop landscape maps' could be used to investigate the relationship between cultivation practices and malaria transmission.

AB Soil resource characterization of Kumaon hills of Himalayas was carried out through soil survey and established soil-physiography relationship after identification and delineation of six physiographic units in Khulgad watershed of Almora district, Uttarakhand. The satellite image characteristics identified through the visual/digital interpretation of IRS-1D LISS-III fused with PAN data on 1:12,500 scale were utilized in the present study. Based on the characteristics of soils developed on different physiographic units, the soils were evaluated for land capability classification and suitability for major crops in the region for sustainable development of the study area. GIS technique was used to develop decision trees employing various soil-site parameters for assessing crop suitability. The results revealed that deep to moderately deep soils with high clay content on the stable terraces and valley lands mostly appearing as dark blue to blackish blue in satellite imagery grouped under land capability classes II and III were interpreted as suitable for wheat, rice, finger millet and mustard crops. Moderately deep to deep soils occurring on moderately steep hill slopes and upper terraces were suitable for potato, mustard and finger millets. Soils on degraded hills with terraced tops having forest in patches (showed mix tone of grey and pink in imagery) categorized into class IV were found to be marginally suitable for wheat, mustard and potato with constraints of soil and topography, while soils on upper hill slopes, degraded hill tops/slopes with thin forest/grazing land and rocky ridges with dark to light blue, white and greyish mixed tone and dark blue with pale pink mixed tone in the imagery placed under land capability classes VI to VII were presently not suitable for crops cultivation and moderately suitable for grassland pasture or silvipasture purposes. The extent of suitability of soils for various crops has also been highlighted using GIS software and the maps were prepared. GIS is found to be helpful in processing spatial and non-spatial remote sensing data and conventional data of highly folded and faulted chain of Kumaon Himalayas to evaluate soil-site parameters for assessing crop suitability for optimum utilization of land.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate of dynamics from the agricultural areas from geotechnologies such as geoprocessing, geographic information systems and remote sensing in the municipality of Faxinal do Soturno located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, from 1989 to 2014. A partial methodology of the realization of multitemporal mapping of the use and land cover of the municipality where water classes, field, agriculture, forest, exposed ground and shade were analyzed. For this, the software SPRING 5.2 was used in the supervised classification of images of the satellite Landsat 5 of the year 1989 and satellite Landsat 8 of the year 2014. Subsequently, the classified images passed through the process of spatial analysis through the Space Language for Algebraic Geoprocessing (LEGAL) that made it possible to show how agricultural areas. From the crossing of information it was possible to verify the following episodes: agricultural expansion, agricultural reduction and agricultural maintenance. The results show that in the 25 years as agricultural areas with expansion of their areas, this fact is strongly linked to the increase in rice production, the highest crop in the city, confirming with IBGE data. It is concluded that the results were important to confirm as current trends observed by the generation of information with the help of geotechnology tools in the municipality.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in remote sensing scene classification due to their excellent performance in natural image classification. However, the complementarity of features extracted by different CNNs is seldom exploited, which limits the further improvement of classification accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a classification method based on multi-structure deep features fusion (MSDFF). First, a data augmentation method based on random-scale cropping is adopted to achieve the expansion of limited data. Then, three popular CNNs are respectively used as feature extractors to capture deep features from the image. Finally, a deep feature fusion network is adopted to fuse these features and implement the classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on UC Merced, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets. The proposed method can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art scene classification methods.

AB Remote sensing (RS) is a very reliable and effective way to monitor the environment and landscape changes. In today's world topographic maps are very important in science, research, planning and management. It is quite possible to detect the changes based on RS data which is obtained at two different times. In this paper, we propose an optimal technique that handles problems like urban green space destruction and detection of crop stress assessment. Firstly, the optimal preprocessing is performed on the given RS dataset, for image enhancement using geometric correction and image registration. Secondly, we propose the improved cat swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the greenery region with the help of vegetation index parameters like Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) & Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Thirdly, we use Conditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimension of a response matrix & retain the dominant information to identify key vegetation indices and the classification of crops. Then, an optimal decision maker-based post classification method is introduced to differentiate area changes based on the overlay of two or more classified images. From the simulation results we observed and conclude that the performance of proposed crop classification, crop stress and yield assessments performed very effective compared to existing methods in terms of F-Measure, recall, precision & accuracy.

AB Acquiring accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields and the corresponding yield is an important first step in meeting the regional and global food security needs. In this study, using dense vegetation index profiles and meteorological parameters from the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) geostationary satellite, we estimated paddy areas and applied a novel approach based on a remote sensing-integrated crop model (RSCM) to simulate spatiotemporal variations in rice yield in Northeastern Asia. Estimated seasonal vegetation profiles of plant canopy from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) were constructed to classify paddy fields as well as their productivity based on a bidirectional reflectance distribution function model (BRDF) and adjusted normalized difference vegetation indices (VIs). In the case of classification, the overall accuracy for detected paddy fields was 78.8% and the spatial distribution of the paddy area was well represented for each selected county based on synthetic applications of dense-time GOCI vegetation index and MODIS water index. For most of the Northeast Asian administrative districts investigated between 2011 and 2017, simulated rice mean yields for each study site agreed with the measured rice yields, with a root-mean-square error of 0.674 t ha(-1), a coefficient of determination of 0.823, a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.524, and without significant differences (p-value = 0.235) according to a sample t-test (alpha = 0.05) for the entire study period. A well-calibrated RSCM, driven by GOCI images, can facilitate the development of novel approaches for the monitoring and management of crop productivity over classified paddy areas, thereby enhancing agricultural decision support systems.

AB In the framework of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) each EU member have to yearly control a proportion of the subsidized surface. Since 1995, the use of optical remote sensing for this control increases and becomes one of the major civilian operational applications of remote sensing. In Belgium the Cellule de Techniques Speciales belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture run an automatic system based on the classification of minimum three high resolution images acquired during the growing season. The time constraint of this operation is very severe as this 39 crop discrimination must guide the in-situ observation of the cultivated fields. This SAR study focuses on two specific and critical issues related to this application:
   Can SAR images substitute the summer optical image which is the main current time constraint for the information delivery?
   Can SAR images increase the current accuracy obtained from the optical images?.

The goal is to obtain a high-resolution multi-spectral image which combines the spectral characteristic of the low-resolution data with the spatial resolution of the miss- ions computer-aided panchromatic image. Unlike other applications, e.g. image fusion in military or quality control, the main constraint in remote sensing is to preserve the spectral information for tasks like classification of ground cover and to more good use of the sport remote sensor image data to apply to monitor land resources changes, updated annually nationwide use maps; Measurement of the area of arable land, estimated forest accumulation, crop growth and yield and grazing are storage capacity and annual changes and so on, and to make the image data more correct and including more information.

AB Markov random field (MRF) clustering, utilizing both spectral and spatial interpixel dependency information, often improves classification accuracy for remote sensing images, such as multichannel polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, it is heavily sensitive to initial conditions such as the choice of the number of clusters and their parameters. In this paper, an initialization scheme for MRF clustering approaches is suggested for remote sensing images. The proposed method derives suitable initial cluster parameters from a set of homogeneous regions, and estimates the number of clusters using the pseudo-likelihood information criterion (PLIC). The method works best for an image consisting of many large homogeneous regions, such as agricultural crops areas. It is illustrated using a well-known polarimetric SAR image of Flevoland in the Netherlands. The experiment shows a superior performance compared to several other methods, such as fuzzy C-means and iterated conditional modes (ICM) clustering.

AB There has been recent interest in the effect of weather on radar backscatter. This paper presents work done in understanding the effect of weather, especially rain on backscatter intensity and phase coherence from crop canopies. in particular, crops typical of South-Eastern England (e.g. wheat and beans).
   Current work centres on the use of a computer model to investigate the effect of rain on radar backscatter from crops over the growing season. These results will then be compared with the weather data, crop observations and SAR data for the local area. The study integrates locally collected datasets including crop observations, meteorological measurements, ERS SAR images and computational modelling in order to better understand how the change in crop radar backscatter throughout the growing season is perturbed by rainfall events.
   The ultimate aim of the study will be to indicate quantitatively, the disturbance effects of rain (and possibly wind) on SAR images of crops in order to improve the monitoring and classification of crops by microwave remote sensing.

AB To meet the demand of large-scale agricultural monitoring system with remote sensing, extracting crop area planted must be rapid, precise and reliable. In this paper, winter wheat identification with MODIS data in 2004 is taken as example in North China. Applying spectral analysis and integrating genetic algorithm with neural network (GA-BP) is proposed, which gives attention to two optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm and back propagation algorithm. According to the spectral and biological characteristics of winter wheat, Red, Blue, NIR, ESWIR, LSWI, EVI are selected as characteristic parameters. Then GA-BP algorithm is used for winter wheat identification. Results show that compared with maximum likelihood and back propagation neural network classification algorithm, the GA-BP algorithm can not only run with better efficiency, but also achieve best accuracy of identification. Therefore, it is the operational method for agricultural condition monitoring with remote sensing and information service system at national level.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food crop for more than half of the world's population. Rice production is facing a myriad of problems, including water shortage, climate, and land-use change. Accurate maps of rice growth stages are critical for monitoring rice production and assessing its impacts on national and global food security. Rice growth stages are typically monitored by coarse-resolution satellite imagery. However, it is difficult to accurately map due to the occurrence of mixed pixels in fragmented and patchy rice fields, as well as cloud cover, particularly in tropical countries. To solve these problems, we developed an automated mapping workflow to produce near real-time multi-temporal maps of rice growth stages at a 10-m spatial resolution using multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-2, MOD13Q1, and Sentinel-1). This study was investigated between 1 June and 29 September 2018 in two (wet and dry) areas of Java Island in Indonesia. First, we built prediction models based on Sentinel-2, and fusion of MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1 using the ground truth information. Second, we applied the prediction models on all images in area and time and separation between the non-rice planting class and rice planting class over the cropping pattern. Moreover, the model's consistency on the multitemporal map with a 5-30-day lag was investigated. The result indicates that the Sentinel-2 based model classification gives a high overall accuracy of 90.6% and the fusion model MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1 shows 78.3%. The performance of multitemporal maps was consistent between time lags with an accuracy of 83.27-90.39% for Sentinel-2 and 84.15% for the integration of Sentinel-2/MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1. The results from this study show that it is possible to integrate multisource remote sensing for regular monitoring of rice phenology, thereby generating spatial information to support local-, national-, and regional-scale food security applications.

AB This study uses remote sensing technology that can provide information about the condition of the earth's surface area, fast, and spatially. The study area was in Karawang District, lying in the Northern part of West Java-Indonesia. We address a paddy growth stages classification using LANDSAT 8 image data obtained from multi-sensor remote sensing image taken in October 2015 to August 2016. This study pursues a fast and accurate classification of paddy growth stages by employing multiple regularizations learning on some deep learning methods such as DNN (Deep Neural Networks) and 1-D CNN (1-D Convolutional Neural Networks). The used regularizations are Fast Dropout, Dropout, and Batch Normalization. To evaluate the effectiveness, we also compared our method with other machine learning methods such as (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost). The data used are seven bands of LANDSAT-8 spectral data samples that correspond to paddy growth stages data obtained from i-Sky (eye in the sky) Innovation system. The growth stages are determined based on paddy crop phenology profile from time series of LANDSAT-8 images. The classification results show that MLP using multiple regularization Dropout and Batch Normalization achieves the highest accuracy for this dataset.

ID COVER
AB Integration of synthetic-aperture radar data with spaceborne optical data offers potential for improving land-use classification for local and state government applications. Remote sensing techniques using optical sensor data are well established for local and state government applications. As commercial SAR products become available at lower costs, local government applications using optical based classification can incorporate SAR sensor data into their processing. For this study, we orthorectified and analyzed Radarsat SAR data and Landsat TM data that covers Boone County, Missouri. Optical and SAR sensor data are co-registered for data fusion and classification process. Training data from sites throughout the study area are used to verify and validate the classification of five classes: crops, water, built-up, forest and grass. Here, we will present preliminary results of our study.

AB Weeds are a severe pest in agriculture, causing extensive yield loss. Weed control of grass and broadleaf weeds is commonly performed by applying selective herbicides homogeneously all over the field. As presented in several studies, applying the herbicide only where needed has economical as well as environmental benefits. Combining remote sensing tools and techniques with the concept of precision agriculture has the potential to automatically locate and identify weeds in order to allow precise control. The objective of this work is to detect annual grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal as well as broadleaf crops, with the aid of field spectroscopy tools. Leaf and canopy spectral relative reflectance values of three targets: crop (wheat and chickpea), grass as well as broadleaf weeds, with soil background, were obtained by Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec Pro FR spectrometer in the range of 400-2400 nm. Leaf spectral classifications for botanical genera as well as category were almost perfect (99%). Canopy spectral classification for targets was accurate (total of 95%) when the field of view (FOV) contained the same target. Within the critical period for weeds control (i.e. 25-40 days after emergence), classification of 87% was achieved for canopy spectra of target in heterogeneous FOV, providing an applicative herbicide implementation. The Spectral Camera HS (Specim) with 1600 pixel per line and 849 bands in the range of 400-1000 nm was selected to continue this study. The properties of the camera should improve the ability to separate spectrally between targets by applying spatial factor. The data obtained by the camera will also be resampled to bands of the superspectral future satellite Vegetation and Environmental New micro Spacecraft (VEN mu S). Thereafter, VEN mu S spectral and spatial resolution should potentially provide precision agricultural applications including weeds control.

AB Remote sensing imagery derived from different sensors has different crop identification capability. due to the different spatial and temporal resolution, availability of certain spectral bands. Landsat OLI and RapidEye provide an important part of data sources for agricultural monitoring with a relative long historic records. As the availability of the data from these two sensors is totally different, an analysis of the crop identification capability using these sensors could provide the stakeholders data source selection for the operational perspectives. This paper took Bei'an city, Heilongjiang province as the study area, where major planted crops are maize and soybean. The authors used maximum likelihood classification methods to try tried to identify best registration phase, best spectral band combination for crop type identification in the study region. Especially, the authors evidenced the identification improvement contributed by the unique short infrared wave band from LANDSAT OLI and red edge band from RapidEye.

AB Most methods used large quantity of field data of the same reference year for crops classification which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study we explored the optical application of time series MODIS EVI with adjacent years of ground reference data for classifying major crops on a regional level in US state of Kansas. Time series MODIS EVI data have been obtained between 2008 and 2013. Ground reference data (2008-2013) of the major crops (winter wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum and alfalfa) in Kansas were acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). A machine learning algorithm namely Antibody Network (ABNet) classifier was used to classify the major crops. The ABNet was trained using five years of ground reference data and verified by ground reference data of the other year. For instance, to classify major crops in 2008, ground reference data of (2009-2013) were used as training samples and the data of that year (i.e. 2008) were used as validation. The results evince the classification accuracy in a range from 74.4 to 81.9% and kappa coefficient of 0.6-0.8 respectively. This method can improve remote sensing imagery in the process of classification and can help to alleviate the heavy load of field data in areas where ground data are unavailable.

AB One of the objectives of conservation agriculture to reduce soil erosion in olive orchards is to protect the soil with cover crops between rows. Andalusian and European administrations have developed regulations to subsidise the establishment of cover crops between rows in olive orchards. Current methods to follow-up the cover crops systems by administrations consist of sampling and on ground visits of around 1% of the total olive orchards surface at any time from March to late June. This paper outlines a multi-objective neural network based method for the classification of olive trees (OT), bare soil (BS) and different cover crops (CC), using remote sensing data taken in spring and summer.
   The main findings of this paper are: (1) the proposed models performed well in all seasons (particularly during the summer, where only 48 pixels of CC are confused with BS and 10 of BS with CC with the best model obtained. This model obtained a 97.80% of global classification, 95.20% in the class with the worst classification rate and 0.9710 in the KAPPA statistics), and (2) the best-performing models could potentially decrease the number of complaints made to the Andalusian and European administrations. The complaints in question concern the poor performance of current on-ground methods to address the presence or absence of cover crops in olive orchards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Crop type identification plays an important role in extracting crop acreage, assessing crop growth and arable land productivity. In this study, the main crops (winter wheat, summer maize and cotton) of Shandong Province as research objects, and the SPOT_VGT normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) remote sensing datasets from 1999 to 2011 covering Shandong Province were acquired. The NDVI characteristic curves of typical features were extracted by combining the SPOT_VGT NDVI time series datasets, the HJ-1B image and the phenological information. Moreover, the reasonable dynamic thresholds were settled, the non-cultivated land areas were removed and the crop patterns and the crop types were identified based on the annual NDVI variation and the phenological information of the typical features. The accuracy assessment was performed through the spatial contrast and quantitative description. The overall accuracy is 77.10% in the spatial accuracy assessment compared with standard land cover classification map, and the overall relative errors of winter wheat, summer maize and cotton are 25.52%, 25.97% and 7.11% in the quantitative accuracy assessment compared with the statistical datasets. The results of research show that it is feasible to identify the crop planting patterns and crop types using the proposed classification method by combining the SPOT_VGT NDVI time series datasets with the phenological information.

AB For real-world simulation, terrain models must combine various types of information on material and texture in terrain reconstruction for the three-dimensional numerical simulation of terrain. However, the construction of such models using the conventional method often involves high costs in both manpower and time. Therefore, this study used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify material in multispectral remote sensing images to simplify the construction of future models. Visible light (i.e., RGB), near infrared (NIR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and digital surface model (DSM) images were examined. This paper proposes the use of the robust U-Net (RUNet) model, which integrates multiple CNN architectures, for material classification. This model, which is based on an improved U-Net architecture combined with the shortcut connections in the ResNet model, preserves the features of shallow network extraction. The architecture is divided into an encoding layer and a decoding layer. The encoding layer comprises 10 convolutional layers and 4 pooling layers. The decoding layer contains four upsampling layers, eight convolutional layers, and one classification convolutional layer. The material classification process in this study involved the training and testing of the RUNet model. Because of the large size of remote sensing images, the training process randomly cuts subimages of the same size from the training set and then inputs them into the RUNet model for training. To consider the spatial information of the material, the test process cuts multiple test subimages from the test set through mirror padding and overlapping cropping; RUNet then classifies the subimages. Finally, it merges the subimage classification results back into the original test image. The aerial image labeling dataset of the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria, abbreviated from the French Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du num & eacute;rique) was used as well as its configured dataset (called Inria-2) and a dataset from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). Material classification was performed with RUNet. Moreover, the effects of the mirror padding and overlapping cropping were analyzed, as were the impacts of subimage size on classification performance. The Inria dataset achieved the optimal results; after the morphological optimization of RUNet, the overall intersection over union (IoU) and classification accuracy reached 70.82% and 95.66%, respectively. Regarding the Inria-2 dataset, the IoU and accuracy were 75.5% and 95.71%, respectively, after classification refinement. Although the overall IoU and accuracy were 0.46% and 0.04% lower than those of the improved fully convolutional network, the training time of the RUNet model was approximately 10.6 h shorter. In the ISPRS dataset experiment, the overall accuracy of the combined multispectral, NDVI, and DSM images reached 89.71%, surpassing that of the RGB images. NIR and DSM provide more information on material features, reducing the likelihood of misclassification caused by similar features (e.g., in color, shape, or texture) in RGB images. Overall, RUNet outperformed the other models in the material classification of remote sensing images. The present findings indicate that it has potential for application in land use monitoring and disaster assessment as well as in model construction for simulation systems.

AB Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems such as Sentinel-2 constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to which extent state of the art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and LANDSAT8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe. The results show that a Random Forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. The approach is fully automatic.

AB Remote sensing allows obtaining information on agriculture regularly with non-invasive measurement approaches. Field data is crucial for adequate agricultural monitoring by remote sensing. However, public available field data are scarce, mainly in tropical regions, where agriculture is highly dynamic. The present publication aims to support the reduction of this gap. The LEM+ dataset provides information monthly about 16 land use classes for 1854 fields from October 2019 to September 2020 (one Brazilian agricultural year) from Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (LEM) and other municipalities in the west of Bahia state, Brazil. The reference data were collected in two fieldworks (March 2020 - first crop season, and August 2020 - second crop season). The boundaries of the fields visited in situ were delimited using Sentinel-2 false color compositions (near infrared - red - green) at 10 m spatial resolution. The land use classes were labeled monthly based on information collected in situ (agricultural land use and photographs) and by visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 false color composition (near infrared - shortwave infrared - red) and MODIS/Terra (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series. The dataset can be useful for the development of new pattern recognition methods for agricultural land use mapping and monitoring, comparison of different classification methods, and optical and SAR remote sensing time series analysis. This dataset contributes to complement previous initiatives [1,2] to make tropical agriculture field reference data publicly available. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Large-scale crop mapping is vitally important to agriculrural monitoring and management. However, traditional methods cannot well meet the needs of large-scale applications. Therefore, this study proposed a method for large-scale crop mapping based on multisource remote sensing images. To be specific, 1) harmonic analysis was conducted on normalized difference vegetation index time-series derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer images and synthetic aperture radar backscattering coefficient time-series derived from Sentinel-1 data, respectively, extracting harmonic-derived phenological features and harmonic-derived backscattering features, and then combined with spectral features from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images to construct the final multisource feature set for crop classification; 2) it employed prior constraints of crop dominance and cropland distribution to reduce misclassifications in large scale crop mapping; and 3) the whole process was conducted on the Google Earth Engine online platform, which can reduce the computational burdens caused by the spatiotemporal data. In the experimental study, we evaluated three crops, including wheat, rapeseed, and corn in Qinhai in 2018, based on the classification and regression tree classifier. The results show that the Jeffries-Matusita distances between crop samples are close to 2, and the overall accuracy is 84.25%. Furthermore, this study found that the distribution of the crops in Qinghai is associated with climate, topography, and cultivation habits.

AB Crop type identification is the basis of crop acreage estimation and plays a key role in crop production prediction and food security analysis. However, the accuracy of crop type identification using remote-sensing data needs to be improved to support operational agriculture-monitoring tasks. In this paper, a new method integrating high-spatial resolution multispectral data with features extracted from coarse-resolution time-series vegetation index data is proposed to improve crop type identification accuracy in Hungary. Four crop growth features, including peak value, date of peak occurrence, average rate of green-up, and average rate for the senescence period were extracted from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) profiles and spatially enhanced to 30 m resolution using resolution merge tools based on a multiplicative method to match the spatial resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. A maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was used to classify the TM and merged images. Independent validation results indicated that the average overall classification accuracy was improved from 92.38% using TM to 94.67% using the merged images. Based on the classification results using the proposed method, acreages of two major summer crops were estimated and compared to statistical data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The proposed method was able to achieve highly satisfactory crop type identification results.

AB Identification of crop and its accuracy is an important aspect in predicting crop production using Remote Sensing technology. This study investigates the ability of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in discriminating fodder crops and estimating its area using moderate resolution multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI data. SVM is a non-parametric statistical learning method and its accuracy is dependent on the parameters and the kernels used. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of SVM in fodder classification and compare the results with traditional parametric Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Fodder crops are available over small fields in the study area thus having large number of pure fodder pixels over small area is difficult. Hence, SVM has an advantage over MLC as it works well with less training data sets also. Three kernels (linear, polynomial and radial based function) were used with SVM classification. Comparative analysis showed that higher overall accuracy was observed in SVM in comparison to MLC. Temporal change in the spectral properties of the crops derived through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multi-temporal Landsat-8 was found to be the most important information that affects accuracy of classification. The classification accuracies for SVM with radial based function, polynomial, linear kernel and MLC were 90.09%, 89.9%, 88.9% and 82.4 % respectively. The result suggested that SVM including three kernels performed significantly better than MLC. India has low livestock productivity due to unavailability of fodder hence this study could help in strengthening the fodder productivity.

AB Recently, there have been very rapid developments in hyperspectral remote sensing and interest is fast growing in the applications of hyperspectral data to precision farming. This paper investigates the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing data for providing better crop management information for use in precision farming by using an artificial intelligence (AI) approach.
   In this study, the ability of the classification and regression trees (CART) decision tree algorithm is examined to classify hyperspectral data of experimental corn plots into categories of water stress, presence of weeds and nitrogen application rates. In the summer of 2003, a three-factor split-split-plot field experiment representing different crop conditions was carried out. Corn was grown under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions with two weed. management strategies: no weed control, and full weed control and with three nitrogen levels of 50, 150, and 250 kg N ha(-1). The hyperspectral data was recorded (spectral resolution = 1 nm) with a hand-held spectroradiometer at three developmental stages of corn-early growth, tasseling, and fully maturity.
   The CART decision tree algorithm was able to classify the 12 treatment combinations with 75-100% accuracy at all 3 recorded stages of development, although the best validation results were obtained at early growth stage. When decision trees (DTs) were generated to classify the plots according to two and then only one of the three factors (irrigation, weeds or nitrogen), the classification accuracy was ever highest. With the spectra obtained at early growth stage and single factor analysis, the classification accuracy was 96% for the irrigation factor, 83% for the nitrogen, and 100% for the weed control strategies.

AB Harvesting wheat (Triticium aestivum L.) for forage or leaving it for grain is the main decision uncertainty growers face in semi-arid regions during mid-season. To facilitate decision-making, a decision support system (DSS) has recently been proposed that requires information about crop water and nutritional status during spike emergence. Though remote sensing has been used to provide site-specific crop status information, a spectral vegetation index is needed to ensure that the information has been acquired during spike emergence. The objective of this study was to propose a spectral index sensitive to spike emergence and validate its suitability across different commercial farm fields by using ground spectral measurements and multispectral satellite imagery. To develop the index, controlled experiments with commonly grown wheat varieties were conducted during the 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 growing season in the agricultural area of the northern Negev desert of Israel, The experiments showed that spike ernergence correlated most strongly (r = 0.7, p < 0.05) with spectral changes near the 1.2 mu m water absorption feature in contrast to the band at 1.1 mu m which appeared to be only weakly correlated. Thus, the spike emergence sensitive band at 1.2 mu m has been combined with the insensitive band at 1.1 mu m as reference to form the ratio-based normalized heading index (NHI). Experimental data were then used to establish an index threshold that helps separate data acquired before and after spike emergence. The proposed NHI was able to identify spike emergence with a classification accuracy varying between 53 and 83%. Accuracy was influenced by season, and whether narrow or broad spectral hands were used. Validation of the index in commercial farm fields in Israel and the United States showed that the classification accuracy was similar for ground spectral measurements and the advanced land imager (ALI) satellite imagery. These results suggest that the NHI is Suited for identifying the onset of heading throughout wheat-growing areas without the need for characterizing seasonal trends. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Land cover identification and monitoring agricultural resources using remote sensing imagery are of great significance for agricultural management and subsidies. Particularly, permanent crops are important in terms of economy (mainly rural development) and environmental protection. Permanent crops (including nut orchards) are extracted with very high resolution remote sensing imagery using visual interpretation or automated systems based on mainly textural features which reflect the regular plantation pattern of their orchards, since the spectral values of the nut orchards are usually close to the spectral values of other woody vegetation due to various reasons such as spectral mixing, slope, and shade. However, when the nut orchards are planted irregularly and densely at fields with high slope, textural delineation of these orchards from other woody vegetation becomes less relevant, posing a challenge for accurate automatic detection of these orchards. This study aims to overcome this challenge using a classification system based on multi-scale textural features together with spectral values. For this purpose, Black Sea region of Turkey, the region with the biggest hazelnut production in the world and the region which suffers most from this issue, is selected and two Quickbird archive images (June 2005 and September 2008) of the region are acquired. To differentiate hazel orchards from other woodlands, in addition to the pansharpened multispectral (4-band) bands of 2005 and 2008 imagery, multi-scale Gabor features are calculated from the panchromatic band of 2008 imagery at four scales and six orientations. One supervised classification method (maximum likelihood classifier, MLC) and one unsupervised method (self-organizing map, SOM) are used for classification based on spectral values, Gabor features and their combination. Both MLC and SOM achieve the highest performance (overall classification accuracies of 95% and 92%, and Kappa values of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively) when multi temporal spectral values and Gabor features are merged. High F-beta values (a combined measure of producer and user accuracy) for detection of hazel orchards (0.97 for MLC and 0.94 for SOM) indicate the high quality of the classification results. When the classification is based on multi spectral values of 2008 imagery and Gabor features, similar F-beta values (0.95 for MLC and 0.93 for SOM) are obtained, favoring the use of one imagery for cost/benefit efficiency. One main outcome is that despite its unsupervised nature, SOM achieves a classification performance very close to the performance of MLC, for detection of hazel orchards.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) and images of various spatial resolution open new vistas for classification and mapping trees. These approaches would improve plant classification in a complex population of forest trees of diverse species, genera, and families, as well as monitoring commercial orchards. In this work, we used new RS indices for cellulose, lignin, wax, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin for plant species classification in natural forests and commercial orchards. For proof of concept, the indices were applied to the classification and mapping of various horticultural crop orchards, where error due to the spatial mixing of different trees is minimal. The classification accuracy of the maps varied between 65 and 82%. This wide range was a result of the following factors: The RS index used, the season, and the spatial resolution of the hyperspectral images. The classification quality was highest when the full set of RS indices was used. The effect of the wax index on accuracy was significant. Furthermore, seasonality played an important role in the classification; the target species were better resolved in spring than in the summer. The higher spatial resolution of the images does not necessarily yield better classification and mapping results; it appeared to be case-specific and greatly depended on the species/crop and the unique environment.

AB Heavy metal pollution in crops leads to phenological changes, which can be monitored by remote sensing technology. The present study aims to develop a method for accurately evaluating heavy metal stress in rice based on remote sensing phenology. First, the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) was applied to blend Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat to generate a time series of fusion images at 30 m resolution, and then the vegetation indices (VIs) related to greenness and moisture content of the rice canopy were calculated to create the time-series of VIs. Second, phenological metrics were extracted from the time-series data of VIs, and a feature selection scheme was designed to acquire an optimal phenological metric subset. Finally, an ensemble model with optimal phenological metrics as classification features was built using random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) classifiers, and the classification of stress levels was implemented. The results demonstrated that the overall accuracy of discrimination for different stress levels is greater than 98%. This study suggests that fusion images can be utilized to detect heavy metal stress in rice, and the proposed method may be applicable to classify stress levels.

AB Remote sensing (RS) offers an efficient and reliable means to map features on Earth. Crop type mapping using RS at various temporal and spatial resolutions plays an important role spanning from environmental to economical. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the significance of optical data in a multi-temporal crop type classification-based on very high spatial resolution and high spatial resolution imagery. With this aim, three images from WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 were acquired over Coalville (UK) between April and July 2016. Three vegetation indices (VIs); the normalized difference vegetation index, the green normalized difference vegetation index and soil adjusted vegetation index were generated using red, green and near-infrared spectral bands; then a supervised classification was performed using ground reference data collected from field surveys, Random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Accuracy assessment was undertaken by comparing the classified output with the reference data. An overall accuracy of 91% and coefficient of 090 were estimated using the combination of RF and DT classification algorithms. Therefore, it can be concluded that integrating very high- and high-resolution imagery with different VIs can be implemented effectively to produce large-scale crop maps even with a limited temporal-dataset.

AB Land cover management practices, including the adoption of cover crops or retaining crop residue during the non-growing season, has important impacts on soil health. To broadly survey these practices, a number of remotely sensed products are available but issues with cloud cover and access to agriculture fields for validation purposes may limit the collection of data over large regions. In this study, we describe the development of a mobile roadside survey procedure for obtaining ground reference data for the remote sensing of agricultural land use practices. The key objective was to produce a dataset of geo-referenced roadside digital images that can be used in comparison to in-field photos to measure agricultural land use and land cover associated with crop residue and cover cropping in the non-growing season. We found a very high level of correspondence (>90% level of agreement) between the mobile roadside survey to in-field ground verification data. Classification correspondence was carried out with a portion of the county-level census image data against 114 in-field manually categorized sites with a level of agreement of 93%. The few discrepancies were in the differentiation of residue levels between 30-60% and >60%, both of which may be considered as achieving conservation practice standards. The described mobile roadside image capture system has advantages of relatively low cost and insensitivity to cloudy days, which often limits optical remote sensing acquisitions during the study period of interest. We anticipate that this approach can be used to reduce associated field costs for ground surveys while expanding coverage areas and that it may be of interest to industry, academic, and government organizations for more routine surveys of agricultural soil cover during periods of seasonal cloud cover.

AB BackgroundThe association between exposure to agricultural pesticides and Parkinson's Disease (PD) has long been a topic of study in the field of environmental health. This research takes advantage of the unique Nebraska PD registry and state-level crop classification data to investigate the PD-pesticides exposure relationship.
   MethodsFirst, Geographic Information System and satellite remote sensing data were adopted to calculate exposure to different pesticides for Nebraska residents. An integrated spatial exploratory framework was then adopted to explore the association between PD incidence and exposure to specific pesticide ingredients at the county level.
   ResultsOur results reveal similarities in geographic patterns of pesticide exposure and PD incidence. The regression analyses indicate that, for most Nebraska counties, PD incidence was significantly associated with exposure to certain pesticide ingredients such as alachlor and broxomy. However, the results also suggest that factors other than pesticide exposure may help further explain the risk of PD at the county level.
   ConclusionsWe found significant associations between PD incidence and exposure to different pesticide ingredients. These results have useful implications for PD prevention in Nebraska and other agricultural states in the United States.

AB The overarching goal of this paper was to espouse methods and protocols for water productivity mapping (WPM) using high spatial resolution Landsat remote sensing data. In a world where land and water for agriculture are becoming increasingly scarce, growing "more crop per drop" (increasing water productivity) becomes crucial for food security of future generations. The study used time-series Landsat ETM+ data to produce WPMs of irrigated crops, with emphasis on cotton in the Galaba study area in the Syrdarya river basin of Central Asia. The WPM methods and protocols using remote sensing data consisted of: (1) crop productivity (ton/ha) maps (CPMs) involving crop type classification, crop yield and biophysical modeling, and extrapolating yield models to larger areas using remotely sensed data; (2) crop water use (m(3)/ha) maps (WUMs) (or actual seasonal evapotranspiration or actual ET) developed through Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model; and (3) water productivity (kg/m(3)) maps (WPMs) produced by dividing raster layers of CPMs by WUMs. The SSEB model calculated WUMs (actual ET) by multiplying the ET fraction by reference ET. The ET fraction was determined using Landsat thermal imagery by selecting the "hot" pixels (zero ET) and "cold" pixels (maximum ET). The grass reference ET was calculated by FAO Penman-Monteith method using meteorological data. The WPMs for the Galaba study area demonstrated a wide variations (0-0.54 kg/m(3)) in water productivity of cotton fields with overwhelming proportion (87%) of the area having WP less than 0.30 kg/m(3), 11% of the area having WP in range of 0.30-0.36 kg/m(3), and only 2% of the area with WP greater than 0.36 kg/m(3). These results clearly imply that there are opportunities for significant WP increases in overwhelming proportion of the existing croplands. The areas of low WP are spatially pin-pointed and can be used as focus for WP improvements through better land and water management practices.

AB The Thai government has promoted the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan for 25 percent in 10 years (AEDP 2012-2021) to reduce the energy importation. This study aimed to assess the potential development of alternative source for biodiesel sector. A case study of three provinces, Krabi, Suratthani, and Nakorn si thammarat, was considered to seek for suitable areas for oil palm expansion based on the land suitability guided by the Good Agriculture Practice (GAP) of the nation. The study emphasized on the AEDP policy implementation for forest conservation and the restriction of expansion only on the pre-existing croplands, mainly the rubber plantation. The results indicated that only the land availability and land suitability in the three provinces would be sufficient for oil palm expansion target as far as any ages of rubber plantation were considered. In fact, only the old plantation with lower production should be deliberated as suitable for land conversion to energy crops. An initial investigation of the possibility of rubber plantation age classification using remote sensing data from THEOS satellite was demonstrated. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Time series remote sensing data have been found very useful in discriminating crops due to its temporal character that map the whole stages of crops. In order to analyze their performances, a range of different time series i.e. 16-day, 32-day, 48-day and 64-day interval was built from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 250-m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. These times series were used to discriminate five crops i-e alfalfa, corn, sorghum, soybean and winter wheat in the United State, Kansas in 2010. The time series data were used to test the discriminating ability of different classifiers like Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Minimum Distance (MD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF) for crop classification. The results showed that the high temporal resolution time series returned high classification accuracy and vice versa. The results comparison showed that RF classifier returned high accuracy (overall accuracy 92.61%) followed by SVM and Neural Network. However, minimum distance and MLC returned low accuracy showing their less adoptability towards different time series data. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The main problem faced by farmers in Indonesia is the diminishing area of agricultural land due to land conversion. Therefore, farmers must be able to choose the most productive types of agricultural plants based on their capability and land suitability in their agricultural areas. This study aims to develop an agroecosystem zone in Temanggung Regency based on remote sensing image processing and geographic information systems (GIS) for evaluating land suitability. The stages of this research are: (1) inventory of land biophysical conditions using primary data (interpretation of multispectral satellite images) and secondary (maps, statistics, results of previous studies); ( 2) study of agroecosystem components to map agroecosystem zone in the research area; and (3) evaluation of land suitability to determine the most productive types of agricultural crops for each agroecosystem zone. This research uses quantitative empirical methods based on landscape ecological approaches. The field sample was determined by stratified random sampling. Data used include: Sentinel-2 image, geological map, soil map, slope map, rainfall data, and land suitability tables for various types of agricultural crops. Image processing techniques begin with the process of rectification, sharpening, and multispectral classification to produce landform maps and land uses. Agroecosystem zones were produced from the overlay process of the agroecosystem components resulting from image and map analysis. Field surveys on predetermined samples were used for obtaining information about the bio-geophysical conditions of the land and the existing conditions of agricultural crops and their productivity, as material for preparing the land suitability map of the research area.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are a remarkable property for soil and environmental monitoring. The understanding of their dynamics in crop soils must go forward. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of temporal environmental controlling factors obtained by satellite images over the SOC stocks along soil depth, using machine learning algorithms. The work was carried out in Sao Paulo state (Brazil) in an area of 2577 km(2). We obtained a dataset of boreholes with soil analyses from topsoil to subsoil (0-100 cm). Additionally, remote sensing covariates (30 years of land use history, vegetation indexes), soil properties (i.e., clay, sand, mineralogy), soil types (classification), geology, climate and relief information were used. All covariates were confronted with SOC stocks contents, to identify their impact. Afterwards, the abilities of the predictive models were tested by splitting soil samples into two random groups (70 for training and 30% for model testing). We observed that the mean values of SOC stocks decreased by increasing the depth in all land use and land cover (LULC) historical classes. The results indicated that the random forest with recursive features elimination (RFE) was an accurate technique for predicting SOC stocks and finding controlling factors. We also found that the soil properties (especially clay and CEC), terrain attributes, geology, bioclimatic parameters and land use history were the most critical factors in controlling the SOC stocks in all LULC history and soil depths. We concluded that random forest coupled with RFE could be a functional approach to detect, map and monitor SOC stocks using environmental and remote sensing data.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB The rapid industrialization and urbanization of an area requires quick preparation of actual land use and land cover (LULC) maps in order to detect and avoid overuse and damage of the landscape beyond sustainable development limits. Remote sensing technology fits well for longterm monitoring and assessment of such effects. The aim of this study is to analyze the expansion of urbanization and LULC changes in Sidon City, Lebanon between 1985 and 2015. The study site is a fast growing region. Therefore, monitoring land changes is an important issue in landscape planning and resource management. In this study, an analysis is carried out for LULC changes in Sidon district via satellite imagery and geographic information systems (GIS). The applied methods consist of two major components: remote sensing-based land classification and GIS-based land change analysis. Seven land cover classes have been detected for evaluating and quantifying the land cover changes for each class within the time frame series from 1985 and 2015. The final results in this study shows the urban expansion and built up areas were clearly detected. Built-up areas took over various unused open areas and in many cases it replaced different agricultural lands. Also results shows the agricultural land changes where some crop types dominates others in some areas and some has been completely transformed to built-up areas. The result from this research indicates that the civil war and conflict with neigbhouring countries brings decline in agricultural areas, impacting the economic aspect of agro trading and destruction of property and development. Yet, after the conflicts ended, Saidon saw significant increase in urbanisation and development activities at local scale.

AB This paper presents the development of a fuzzy model for classification of paddy growth stages based on synthetic MODIS data. Classification of growth stages is an important process in prediction of crop production using a remote-sensing technology. The proposed approach takes advantages of the nature of a fuzzy system which is able to capture gradual changes/movements by fitting its membership functions. A novel approach to shaping fuzzy input membership functions based on box-plot parameters is also presented. The developed fuzzy model was build and tested on 3935 sets of synthetic MODIS data. The results show that the proposed method was able to classify the growth stages satisfactorily and was robust to handle noises in the data.

AB For the application of agricultural area, remote sensing techniques were studied and applied for its advantages for continuous and quantitative monitoring. Especially, hyperspectral images have been studied for the precise agriculture since they provide chemical and physical information of vegetation. In this study, we analyzed crop types using hyperspectral image data collected by a ground scanner. Spectral mixture analysis, which is widely used for processing hyperspectral images, was adopted for the crop discrimination. Endmember extraction algorithms used in this study were N-FINDR, Vertex Component Analysis (VCA), and Simplex Identification via variable Splitting and Augmented Lagrangian (SISAL), and classification was processed using fully constrained linear spectral unmixing (FCLSU). This study presents the application of spectral mixture analysis for hyperspectral scanner data at canopy level and optimal endmember extraction algorithms for different crop types for precise agriculture.

TI Image segmentation for improved consistency in image-interpretation of

ID AFGHANISTAN; INFORMATION
AB The image-interpretation of opium poppy crops from very high resolution satellite imagery forms part of the annual Afghanistan opium surveys conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United States Government. We tested the effect of generalization of field delineations on the final estimates of poppy cultivation using survey data from Helmand province in 2009 and an area frame sampling approach. The sample data was reinterpreted from pan-sharpened IKONOS scenes using two increasing levels of generalization consistent with observed practice. Samples were also generated from manual labelling of image segmentation and from a digital object classification. Generalization was found to bias the cultivation estimate between 6.6% and 13.9%, which is greater than the sample error for the highest level. Object classification of image-segmented samples increased the cultivation estimate by 30.2% because of systematic labelling error. Manual labelling of image-segmented samples gave a similar estimate to the original interpretation. The research demonstrates that small changes in poppy interpretation can result in systematic differences in final estimates that are not included within confidence intervals. Segmented parcels were similar to manually digitized fields and could provide increased consistency in field delineation at a reduced cost. The results are significant for Afghanistan's opium monitoring programmes and other surveys where sample data are collected by remote sensing.

DT Article
AB With its all-day and all-weather imaging capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has shown great potential in crop identification. This letter puts forward a novel method of extracting winter wheat planting area by means of SAR change detection. Based on the phenological differences between winter wheat and other crops, the Difference Image (DI) is generated firstly by the different temporal SAR images. Then, Object Markov Random Field (OMRF) model is used to DI pre-classification. Finally, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to obtain the better area extraction result of winter wheat. The area extraction accuracy is proved by the field survey data, with an accuracy of 90.53%. This research can provide a new idea and method for agricultural remote sensing monitoring.

TI Optimal land use/land cover classification using remote sensing imagery

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING

DE Land use/land cover; decision tree; maximum likelihood classification;
   image fusion; hydrological modeling; Himalayan watershed

AB Land use/land cover is an important watershed surface characteristic that affects surface runoff and erosion. Many of the available hydrological models divide the watershed into Hydrological Response Units (HRU), which are spatial units with expected similar hydrological behaviours. The division into HRU's requires good-quality spatial data on land use/land cover. This paper presents different approaches to attain an optimal land use/land cover map based on remote sensing imagery for a Himalayan watershed in northern India. First digital classifications using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and a decision tree classifier were applied. The results obtained from the decision tree were better and even improved after post classification sorting. But the obtained land use/land cover map was not sufficient for the delineation of HRUs, since the agricultural land use/land cover class did not discriminate between the two major crops in the area i.e. paddy and maize. Subsequently the digital classification on fused data (ASAR and ASTER) were attempted to map land use/land cover classes with emphasis to delineate the paddy and maize crops but the supervised classification over fused datasets did not provide the desired accuracy and proper delineation of paddy and maize crops. Eventually, we adopted a visual classification approach on fused data. This second step with detailed classification system resulted into better classification accuracy within the 'agricultural land' class which will be further combined with topography and soil type to derive HRU's for physically-based hydrological modeling.

AB For accurate crop classification, it is necessary to use time-series of high-resolution satellite data to better discriminate among certain crop types. This task brings the following challenges: a large amount of satellite data for download, Big data processing and computational resources for utilization of state-of-the-art classification approaches. For solving these problems, we have developed an automated crop classification workflow, which is based on machine-learning techniques. By deployment of the workflow on the cloud platform, we can overcome challenges of Big data downloading and processing. In this paper, we present the system architecture and describe the experiments on structural and parametric identification of machine learning models utilized in the system.

AB Although optical remote sensing can capture the Earth's environment with visible and infrared sensors, it is limited by weather conditions. Often, only a few sets of cloud-free optical imagery are available in cloudy regions, where many agricultural towns are located. On the other hand, radar remote sensing can capture imagery under cloudy conditions. In this study, we examined the capability of Sentinel-1 multitemporal dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in a whole year from Google Earth Engine in crop mapping in two study sites in Chongqing, China, and Landivisiau, France. Results show that it is possible to produce better crop classification maps using multitemporal SAR imagery, but the performance is limited by local terrain. Flat agricultural regions, such as Western Europe, are expected to benefit from the multitemporal SAR information. Mountain agricultural regions, such as Southwestern China, will encounter difficulties due to the undulate terrain. We also tested two sampling strategies, i.e., random sampling and regional sampling, and observed high variation in overall accuracy: the former led to a higher accuracy. The gap is caused by the diversity of training sets examined using tSNE visualization. The importance of SAR channels in each month are correlated with their entropy. Data from the growing season are important in distinguishing crop types. The 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved similar results under a huge computation cost compared with 2-D CNNs. Based on the experiments, we recommend to use a lightweight 2-D CNN that can run on the CPU for real-world crop mapping with SAR data.

AB As a provincial centre for remote sensing in Shanxi, it has developed its integrated remote sensing and GIS system for agricultural resource assessment and monitoring in the Province with a very complex loess highland landscape, segmented land parcels and multi-diversity crops. The structure of the system was designed such that it can be readily updated to integrate the remote sensing (TM and CB-1) and other types of agricultural information needed for timely agricultural monitoring and assessment. In addition to introduce the structure and application of the system, this paper will focus on the innovative methods implemented in the system for improving interpretation accuracy and minimizing the information loss due to resampling process involved in fusing multiple images and the resolution alteration. The key issues we address here include (1) multi-scale processes. The systems can readily handle problem in various scales such as province, city and county scales; (2) Determination of 100m x 100m as the optimum re-sampling resolution for fusion and integration of various data for the application in the province scale. The resolution has been shown adequate both for the analysis and for the capacity of the facility available at the centre; and (3) Integration of GIS and RS to assist the information extraction, classification and identification of features. It has been shown the processes implemented in the project are important because reducing resolution of images so that large volumes of multiple band remote sensing data can be processed in a moderate system affordable at the Provincial level in China has become a common task in application of remote sensing data for a large district assessment and monitoring agricultural resources.

AB In the last decade, technologies of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and small imaging sensors have achieved a significant improvement in terms of equipment cost, operation cost and image quality. These low-cost platforms provide flexible access to high resolution visible and multispectral images. As a result, many studies have been conducted regarding the applications in precision agriculture, such as water stress detection, nutrient status detection, yield prediction, etc. Different from traditional satellite low-resolution images, high-resolution UAV-based images allow much more freedom in image post-processing. For example, the very first procedure in post-processing is pixel classification, or image segmentation for extracting region of interest(ROI). With the very high resolution, it becomes possible to classify pixels from a UAV-based image, yet it is still a challenge to conduct pixel classification using traditional remote sensing features such as vegetation indices (VIs), especially considering various changes during the growing season such as light intensity, crop size, crop color etc. Thanks to the development of deep learning technologies, it provides a general framework to solve this problem. In this study, we proposed to use deep learning methods to conduct image segmentation. We created our data set of pomegranate trees by flying an off-shelf commercial camera at 30 meters above the ground around noon, during the whole growing season from the beginning of April to the middle of October 2017. We then trained and tested two convolutional network based methods U-Net and Mask R-CNN using this data set. Finally, we compared their performances with our dataset aerial images of pomegranate trees. [Tiebiao-add a sentence to summarize the findings and their implications to precision agriculture]

TI Crop and land cover classification in Iran using Landsat 7 imagery
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE
AB Remote sensing provides one way of obtaining more accurate information on total cropped area and crop types in irrigated areas. The technique is particularly well suited to arid and semi-arid areas where almost all vegetative growth is associated with irrigation. In order to obtain more information with regard to crop patterns in the irrigated areas in the Zayandeh Rud basin, a classification analysis was made of the Landsat 7 image of 2 July 2000. The target of the classification was to primarily focus on the agricultural land use. The date of the image fell in the transition period where the first crops were harvested and many fields were being prepared for the second crop. The image has therefore captured an instantaneous picture of a system generally in transition from the first to the second crop, but with significant differences from system to system, both with respect to crop types and agricultural cycles. The overall accuracy of image registration was about 30 m (one pixel). Fieldwork was conducted on various occasions in August-October 2000 and May-October 2001. Farmers were interviewed to determine the situation on 2 July 2000. Fields were mapped in detail with the GPS instruments, and data compiled for 112 fields. Using a supervised classification system, training areas were selected and initial classifications were made to determine the validity of the classes. After merging several classes and testing several new classes a final classification system was made. All seven Landsat bands were used in the determination of the feature statistics. The final classification was made with the minimum distance algorithm. The statistics with respect to areas and crop type for the districts was obtained by crossing the raster map with the irrigation district raster map. The results with respect to crop type and total irrigated area per district were compared with those of previous studies. This included both NOAA/AVHRR and conventional agricultural district statistics.

AB Although hyperspectral remote sensing has been used to study many agricultural phenomena such as crop stress and diseases, the potential use of this technique for detecting Ganoderma disease infestations and damage to oil palms under field conditions has not been explored to date. This research was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using a portable hyperspectral remote-sensing instrument to identify spectral differences between oil-palm leaves with and without Ganoderma infections. Reflectance spectra of samples representative of three classes of disease severity were collected. The most significant bands for spectral discrimination were selected from reflectance spectra and first derivatives of reflectance spectra. The significant wavelengths were identified using one-way analysis of variance. Then, a Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance measurement was used to determine spectral separability between the classes. A maximum likelihood classifier method was used to classify the three classes based on the most significant wavelength spectral responses, and an error matrix was finally used to assess the accuracy of the classification.

TI Exploiting spectral and spatial information for the identification of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
ID IMAGERY; VINEYARDS; ORCHARDS
AB Automatic land-cover identification using remote-sensing images is essential for agricultural management and monitoring, which is an ongoing challenge. For permanent crops, which are of great importance economically and environmentally, it becomes even more challenging mainly due to the varying statistics of orchards such as the existence of different orchard types, different crown sizes even for the same type, different distances between orchards among various fields and overlapping crowns. This challenge necessitates the utilization of both spectral values and spatial relations of pixels. To accurately determine the fields of permanent crops, hazelnuts in particular, a classification system with hybrid learning, which merges an image features map (IFM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ), is proposed in this study. IFM is a variant of a self-organizing map (an unsupervised neural learning paradigm successfully used in many applications of remote-sensing imagery), which exploits both spectral and spatial information without additional computation of texture. LVQ, however, is supervised learning for fine-tuning of class boundaries. Experimental results on finding hazelnut fields using multispectral QuickBird imagery indicate that the proposed method achieves acceptable accuracies and often produces more accurate extraction than the accuracies obtained based only on spectral or on spatial information.

TI CROP INVESTIGATION USING HIGH-RESOLUTION WORLDVIEW-1 AND QUICKBIRD-2
   SATELLITE IMAGES ON A TEST SITE IN BULGARIA
SO AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper aims to investigate the capabilities of using high-resolution satellite images: panchromatic WorldView-1 satellite image acquired on 30/11/2011 and multispectral QuickBird-2 satellite image acquired on 31/05/2009 for crop analysis, which includes crop identification, crop condition assessment and crop area estimates applications in Bulgaria using the power and flexibility of ERDAS IMAGINE tools. The crop identification was accomplished using unsupervised and supervised classification processing techniques using as reference ground data. After the supervised classification, fuzzy convolution filter was applied to reduce the mixed pixels using ERDAS Imagine software. Accuracy totals, error matrix and kappa statistics were calculated using accuracy assessment tool in ERDAS Imagine to assess the quality of the classification process. Crop condition assessment was accomplished using the derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image from the QuickBird-2 image, which was reclassified and was given meaningful estimations on the crop condition. Crop area was estimated using pixel counting approach. Pixel counting methods are known for introducing bias to the crop area estimates but using the high Overall Accuracy of 90.86% and overall Kappa Statistics of 0.8538 for the classified QuickBird-2 image and Overall Accuracy of 86.71% and overall Kappa Statistics of 0.7721% for the classified WorldView-1 allows that option to be utilized according to (Gallego, 2004). As a conclusion it can be stated that using the benefits that high-resolution satellite images gives in combination with the power and flexibility of ERDAS Imagine tools, crop identification can be achieved more accurately by increasing the identification accuracy and also by having the necessary ground information for selecting appropriate training samples. Crop identification by applying an arable mask is better practice, because it is reducing the mixed pixels problem i.e. also known as "salt and pepper effect" (common for coarse and low resolution satellite images), As a result it is making the map products much more useful thus making more accurate crop area estimates when pixel counting methods are used.

AB This paper presents a new method based on the application of Modular Neural Networks to agricultural land use classification and compares the advantages and disadvantages over a single complex neural network approach.
   Neural Networks (NN) have been found to have good generalisation properties [1] and their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in the field of remote sensing [2]. However, there are a number of remote sensing problems where neural networks do not necessarily provide an optimum solution, these include mixed pixel analysis, subclass characterisation and parameter extraction for use in biophysical models [3]. Typically the application of NN techniques to remote sensing involves using one NN to classify a large number of land-cover classes[4]. The authors have previously found this approach to be inefficient and inaccurate [5], a modular approach is therefore implemented which is more flexible.
   This paper applies these techniques to optical imagery. The area used for this work is a research farm in Bavaria, Germany, which comprises of a highly dynamic terrain with small field units. High resolution land-use maps and yield data have been produced for the research farm, using GPS equipment attached to crop harvesters. These maps enable accurate selection of test classes and are used to validate the results produced by the various techniques.

AB Automatic methods for an early detection of plant diseases (i.e., visible symptoms at early stages of disease development) using remote sensing are critical for precision crop protection. Verticillium wilt (VW) of olive caused by Verticillium dahliae can be controlled only if detected at early stages of development. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classification methods were applied to classify V. dahliae severity using remote sensing at large scale. High-resolution thermal and hyperspectral imagery were acquired with a manned platform which flew a 3000-ha commercial olive area. LDA reached an overall accuracy of 59.0% and a kappa of 0.487 while SVM obtained a higher overall accuracy, 79.2% with a similar kappa, 0.495. However, LDA better classified trees at initial and low severity levels, reaching accuracies of 71.4 and 75.0%, respectively, in comparison with the 14.3% and 40.6% obtained by SVM. Normalized canopy temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, structural, xanthophyll, chlorophyll, carotenoid and disease indices were found to be the best indicators for early and advanced stage infection by VW. These results demonstrate that the methods developed in other studies at orchard scale are valid for flights in large areas comprising several olive orchards differing in soil and crop management characteristics.

AB Managing groundwater resources requires quantification of several complex atmosphere/surface properties affecting recharge, including precipitation, temperature, soils, land cover and land cover change. In this review we elaborate on some of the remote sensing techniques commonly applied for generating information about changes in land cover, over large geographical areas, which are often required for hydrogeological studies. Two case studies are presented: the Chateauguay River Basin (Quebec) and Casselman Township (Ontario). Both examples represent agriculture dominated landscapes that require a unique mapping approach to minimize confusion between agriculture and forest classes. The first example demonstrates a procedure for mapping land cover aerial extent and change using remote sensing data acquired off the peak of the growing season where agricultural fields can be most effectively discriminated from forests. In the second example three classification methods are compared for mapping specific crop types. Results did not show substantially greater performance for any one of the three methods. Differences in processing and theoretical advantages are considered the main criteria for selection. The analyzes undertaken highlight the need to minimize phenology effects between image dates, by selecting images before leaf out or after leaf senesce for effective change detection and using several dates of imagery over the growing season to effectively map crop types.

AB The optimization of water resources management in arid region needs reliable information and knowledge on water resources and water requirements. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques are used to estimate the Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) in the Regueb-watershed for the summer season, when the peak of the water consumption is reached. The landsat 8 images were used to identify irrigated area and to estimate the IWR in dry season. Five methods were applied for the identification of irrigated area based on supervised classification and spectral indices. Two different approaches were applied to estimate IWR: K-c-NDVI method based on the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (K-c) and FAO approach based on the empirical equation of Penman-Monteith and the single Kc given by FAO-56. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) performed the highest overall accuracy (85%) and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. The IWR resulting values range from 10 to 14.5 Mm(3) in summer season. To evaluate the methodology, five test areas were selected based on the diversity of crops in the whole study area. The validation of results indicates that the IWR values calculated using FAO method were in good agreement with the IWR values derived from remote sensing approach.

AB Crofton weed, which was introduced to the southwest of China in the 1940s via the border between China and Burma, now has a seriously damaging effect on the biodiversity and the living environment in those regions, including Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Tibet, Chongqing, and Hubei. To help monitor this situation effectively, there have been many researches that utilize remote sensing images to identify the spread of Crofton weed. However, most of these researches found it difficult to identify Crofton weed because it is mixed and entangled with a large number of other vegetation. In our research, data processing includes three steps: 1) Retrieving the spectral feature values of Crofton weed at the different growth stages through long time regional sampling; 2) Comparing the NDVI of Crofton weeds, forests, crops, water bodies, residential areas in the typical sampling regions by using the time series data of remote sensing images; and finally, 3) Classifying the remote sensing images of the research regions according to the distinctive features of NDVI curves based on the time series data. The outcome of following these three data processing steps is a relatively accurate classification result, which produces a high-accuracy distribution map of the Crofton weed.

AB This paper chose the typical salinization area in Kenli County of the Yellow River Delta as the study area, selected HJ-1A satellite HSI image at March 15, 2011 and TM image at March 22, 2011 as source of information, and pre-processed these data by image cropping, geometric correction and atmospheric correction. Spectral characteristics of main land use types including different degree of salinization lands, water and shoals were analyzed to find distinct bands for information extraction. Land use information extraction model was built by adopting the quantitative and qualitative rules combining the spectral characteristics and the content of soil salinity. Land salinization information was extracted via image classification using decision tree method. The remote sensing image interpretation accuracy was verified by land salinization degree, which was determined through soil salinity chemical analysis of soil sampling points. In addition, classification accuracy between the hyperspectral and multi-spectral images were analyzed and compared. The results showed that the overall image classification accuracy of HSI was 96.43%, Kappa coefficient was 95.59%; while the overall image classification accuracy of TM was 89.17%, Kappa coefficient was 86.74%. Therefore, compared to multi-spectral TM data, the hyperspectral imagery could be more accurate and efficient for land salinization information extraction. Also, the classification map showed that the soil salinity distinction degree of hyperspectral image was higher than that of multi-spectral image. This study explored the land salinization information extraction techniques from hyperspectral imagery, extracted the spatial distribution and area ratio information of different degree of salinization land, and provided decision-making basis for the scientific utilization and management of coastal salinization land resources in the Yellow River Delta.

AB In the present study, VV polarization microwave backscatter data used for improving accuracies of spectral classification of crop is investigated. Classification accuracy using different classifiers based on the fusion data of Hi satellite multi-spectral and Envisat ASAR VV backscatter data are compared. The results indicate that fusion data can take full advantage of spectral information of HJ multi-spectral data and the structure sensitivity feature of ASAR VV polarization data. The fusion data enlarges the spectral difference among different classifications and improves crop classification accuracy. The classification accuracy using fusion data can be increased by 5 percent compared to the single Hi data. Furthermore, ASAR VV polarization data is sensitive to non-agrarian area of planted field, and VV polarization data joined classification can effectively distinguish the field border. VV polarization data associating with multi-spectral data used in crop classification enlarges the application of satellite data and has the potential of spread in the domain of agriculture.

AB The termination or interruption of agro-forestry practices for a long period gradually results in abandoned land. Abandoned land parcels do not match the requirements to access to the basic payment of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Therefore, the identification of those parcels is key in order to return fair subsidies to farmers. In this context, the present work proposes a methodology to detect abandoned crops in the Valencian Community (Spain) from remote sensing data. The approach is based on the assessment of multitemporal Sentinel-2 images and derived spectral indices, which are used as predictors for training machine learning and deep learning classifiers. Several classification scenarios, including both abandoned and active parcels, were evaluated. The best results (98.2% overall accuracy) were obtained when a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network was trained with a multitemporal dataset composed of twelve reflectance time series, and a derived bare soil spectral index (BSI). In this scenario we were able to effectively distinguish abandoned crops from active ones. The results revealed Sentinel-2 features are well suited for land use identification including abandoned lands, and open the possibility of implementing this type of remote sensing based methodology into the CAP payments supervision.

AB The crop detection and classification using satellite imagery can be helpful in crop management. Therefore, it is needed to be explored for effective crop detection and classification. In this study, the phenological metrics derived from dense Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series from January 2017 to June 2018 were used to classify sugarcane crop type. The Savitzkey-Golay method was employed as curve fitting method for smoothening and filtering of the pre-processed NDVI time-series data. Thereafter, the phenological metrics extracted from TIMESAT were used to classify planted and ratoon sugarcane using the decision-tree approach. The overall accuracy was 84.5%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.7. The results showed that the classification method was consistent and robust which has the potential to increase the classification accuracy by the use of better resolution satellite imagery time-series. Moreover, the phenological metrics have the potential to explain the spatial distribution of agricultural pattern, use of crop varieties and management practices that can be useful in better understanding of agricultural practices in the region along with crop diversification and crop yield modelling.

AB An agricultural land use classification of Oltrepo' Pavese region (in Northern Italy) is performed through integration of remote sensing data from optical and radar sensors. The source of optical data was a Landsat-TM image acquired on April 1994, while the source of microwave data was a contemporaneous image of the new radar sensor SIR-C/X-SAR which was flown on-board the Space Shuttle during an experimental mission over the chosen test site. Then, they were combined through calculation of the principal components of the multidimensional data sets and a final classification was carried out and compared with the classifications obtained from optical and radar recordings separately. Results showed remarkable improvement in the classification accuracy of seedbeds and uncultivated fields with radar recordings and of herbaceous crop type with integrated data. Potential ability of a multi-sensor classification and limits of a single-temporal approach are discussed.

AB A continuously growing world population increases steadily the demand of foods. This results in strong changes that occur on agricultural sites. Remote sensing data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor these changes which is a crucial base to asses the impact of these changes on the climate or the natural resources. In the presented study, we tested the performance of a new crop classification method for a stack of Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) images taken within one growing season. We proved, that the new PSP method performs better for S1 images revealing an overall accuracy (OA) of 75% compared to 60% for the Random Forest classifier (RF). The PSP method outperformed also for the fused dataset of S1 and S2 images (72% OA for PSP, 62% for RF). The results illustrate the benefits for crop classifications provided by PSP and give crucial insights for the advantages and limits of S1 and S2 data fusion.

AB Monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of yield crop traits using remote sensing techniques is the basis for the correct adoption of precision farming. Vegetation index images are mainly associated with yield and yield-related physiological traits, although quick and sound strategies for the classification of the areas with plants with homogeneous agronomic crop traits are still to be explored. A classification technique based on remote sensing spectral information analysis was performed to discriminate between wheat cultivars. The study analyzes the ability of the cluster method applied to the data of three vegetation indices (VIs) collected by high-resolution UAV at three different crop stages (seedling, tillering, and flowering), to detect the yield and yield component dynamics of seven durum wheat cultivars. Ground truth data were grouped according to the identified clusters for VI cluster validation. The yield crop variability recorded in the field at harvest showed values ranging from 2.55 to 7.90 t. The ability of the VI clusters to identify areas with similar agronomic characteristics for the parameters collected and analyzed a posteriori revealed an already important ability to detect areas with different yield potential at seedling (5.88 t ha(-1) for the first cluster, 4.22 t ha(-1) for the fourth). At tillering, an enormous difficulty in differentiating the less productive areas in particular was recorded (5.66 t ha(-1) for cluster 1 and 4.74, 4.31, and 4.66 t ha(-1) for clusters 2, 3, and 4, respectively). An excellent ability to group areas with the same yield production at flowering was recorded for the cluster 1 (6.44 t ha(-1)), followed by cluster 2 (5.6 t ha(-1)), cluster 3 (4.31 t ha(-1)), and cluster 4 (3.85 t ha(-1)). Agronomic crop traits, cultivars, and environmental variability were analyzed. The multiple uses of VIs have improved the sensitivity of k-means clustering for a new image segmentation strategy. The cluster method can be considered an effective and simple tool for the dynamic monitoring and assessment of agronomic traits in open field wheat crops.

AB Coffee production was closely linked to the economic development of Brazil and, even today, coffee is an important product of the national agriculture. The State of Minas Gerais currently accounts for 52% of the whole coffee area in Brazil. Remote sensing data can provide information for monitoring and mapping of coffee crops, faster and cheaper than conventional methods. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of coffee crop mapping in Monte Santo de Minas municipality, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from fraction images derived from MODIS data, in both dry and rainy seasons. The Spectral Linear Mixing Model was used to derive fraction images of soil, coffee, and water/ shade. These fraction images served as input data for the supervised automatic classification using the SVM - Support Vector Machine approach. The best results concerning Overall Accuracy and Kappa Index were obtained in the classification of the dry season, with 67% and 0.41, respectively.

AB Tomato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases, several of which may be present during the same season. Therefore, rapid disease identification could enhance crop management consequently increasing the yield. In this study, nondestructive methods were developed to detect diseases that affect tomato crops, such as bacterial spot (BS), target spot (TS), and tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) for two varieties of tomato (susceptible and tolerant to TYLC only) by using hyperspectral sensing in two conditions: a) laboratory (benchtop scanning), and b) in field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-based). The stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA) and the radial basis function were applied to classify the infected plants and distinguish them from noninfected or healthy (H) plants. Multiple vegetation indices (VIs) and the M statistic method were utilized to distinguish and classify the diseased plants. In general, the classification results between healthy and diseased plants were highly accurate for all diseases; for instance, when comparing H vs. BS, TS, and TYLC in the asymptomatic stage and laboratory conditions, the classification rates were 94%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, in the symptomatic stage, the classification rates between healthy and infected plants were 98% for BS, and 99-100% for TS and TYLC diseases. The classification results in the field conditions also showed high values of 98%, 96%, and 100%, for BS, TS, and TYLC, respectively. The VIs that could best identify these diseases were the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and the modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI 1) in both laboratory and field. The results were promising and suggest the possibility to identify these diseases using remote sensing.

AB Crop classification within large agricultural regions is challenging owing to the presence of crops with similar phenological variation and intra-class variability. The development of efficient and simple classification methods is needed for more accurate mapping, monitoring, and analysis of land-use categories. Multi-seasonal aggregated statistical variables of Tasseled-Cap (TC) bands (brightness (B), greenness (G), and wetness (W)) obtained from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite (Landsat 7 ETM+) covering cropped areas in the catchments of the Ica and Grande Rivers of Peru were evaluated to assess the performance of random forest (RF) classifiers in identifying crop type. The effects of various TC band combinations on the classification results were also examined. Seventeen crops (asparagus, cotton, grape, maize, mango, and so on) were included. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient analyses showed that the three-band combination of B G W, using multi-seasonal data, led to more accurate classification than did other combinations, yielding values of 86% and 0.81, respectively. The results indicate that employing aggregated statistical variables of TC bands in conjunction with RF classification techniques by using freely available multi-temporal satellite image data is not only a useful but also more economical and computationally efficient method for crop classification than the current one.

AB Governments compile their agricultural statistics in tabular form by administrative area, which gives no clue to the exact locations where specific crops are actually grown. Such data are poorly suited for early warning and assessment of crop production. 10-Daily satellite image time series of Andalucia, Spain, acquired since 1998 by the SPOT Vegetation Instrument in combination with reported crop area statistics were used to produce the required crop maps. Firstly, the 10-daily (1998-2006) 1-km resolution SPOT-Vegetation NDVI-images were used to stratify the study area in 45 map units through an iterative unsupervised classification process. Each unit represents an NDVI-profile showing changes in vegetation greenness over time which is assumed to relate to the types of land cover and land use present. Secondly, the areas of NDVI-units and the reported cropped areas by municipality were used to disaggregate the crop statistics. Adjusted R-squares were 98.8% for rainfed wheat, 97.5% for rainfed sunflower, and 76.5% for barley. Relating statistical data on areas cropped by municipality with the NDVI-based unit map showed that the selected crops were significantly related to specific NDVI-based map units. Other NDVI-profiles did not relate to the studied crops and represented other types of land use or land cover. The results were validated by using primary field data. These data were collected by the Spanish government from 2001 to 2005 through grid sampling within agricultural areas; each grid (block) contains three 700 m x 700 m segments. The validation showed 68%, 31% and 23% variability explained (adjusted R-squares) between the three produced maps and the thousands of segment data. Mainly variability within the delineated NDVI-units caused relatively low values; the units are internally heterogeneous. Variability between units is properly captured. The maps must accordingly be considered "small scale maps". These maps can be used to monitor crop performance of specific cropped areas because of using hypertemporal images. Early warning thus becomes more location and crop specific because of using hypertemporal remote sensing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Context Open data policies and accessible computation platforms allow efficient extraction of information from remote sensing data for landscape research. Landscape ecology is strongly influenced by remote sensing, and the value of fine resolution temporal information for characterising landscapes is under-explored. Objectives We highlighted the importance of temporal information extracted from remote sensing data gathered over a period of time for landscape research. A case study approach was used to show how time-series information can benefit the mapping of land cover and landscape elements in a heterogeneous landscape dominated by agricultural land use. Methods We constructed four composite images of the study area, each incorporating different levels of temporal information. The images either represent a single date or summarise temporal information into single values as the median of spectral bands or vegetation indices. Random forest and k-means clustering methods were used to classify the images. Results The overall accuracy of the landscape classifications ranged between 0.3 to 0.8, increasing substantially when including temporal information, for mapping both land cover and small landscape elements. Using temporal information and a RF-based classification it was generally possible to map crop and forest types. The size of landscape elements was overestimated, although the clustering model predicted elements close to their true size and complexity. Conclusions The approach highlights the importance of temporal resolution for landscape ecology research. The easy-to-implement methodology offers an opportunity for landscape ecologists to increase the accuracy of landscape mapping and identify ecologically important landscape elements that might otherwise be missed.

AB The remote sensing (RS) technique is less cost- and labour- intensive than ground-based surveys for diverse applications in agriculture. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), provides an effective approach to construct a model for regression and classification of a multivariate and non-linear system. Without being explicitly programmed, machine learning models learn from training data, i.e., past experience. Machine learning, when applied to remotely sensed data, has the potential to evolve a real-time farm-specific management system to reinforce farmers' ability to make appropriate decisions. Recently, the use of machine learning techniques combined with RS data has reshaped precision agriculture in many ways, such as crop identification, yield prediction and crop water stress assessment, with better accuracy than conventional RS methods. As agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of the worldwide water withdrawals, it must be used in the most efficient way to obtain maximum yields and food production. The use of water management and irrigation based on plant water stress have been demonstrated to not only save water but also increase yield. To date, RS and ML-based results have encouraged farmers and decision-makers to adopt this technology to meet global food demands. This phenomenon has led to the much-needed interest of researchers in using ML to improve agriculture outcomes. However, the use of ML for the potential evaluation of water stress continues to be unexplored and the existing methods can still be greatly improved. This study aims to present an overall review of the widely used methods for crop water stress monitoring using remote sensing and machine learning and focuses on future directions for researchers.

AB Heavy rainfall and hailstorm events occurred in major wheat-growing areas of India during February and March 2015 causing large-scale damages to the crop. An attempt was made to assess the impact of hailstorms in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (MP) using remote sensing data. Multi-year remote sensing data from Resourcesat 2 AWiFS was used for the purpose. Wheat crop map, generated by the operational FASAL project, was used in the study. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) deviation images were generated from the NDVI images of a similar period in 2014 and 2015. This was combined with the gridded data of cumulative rainfall during the period. The logical modelling approach was used for damage classification into normal, mild, moderate and severe. It was found that the northern and southern districts in Haryana were severely affected due to rainfall/hailstorm. Eastern Rajasthan and western MP were also highly affected. Western UP was mildly affected. Crop cutting experiments (CCE) were carried out in two districts of MP. The CCE data showed that the affected fields had 7% lower yield than the unaffected fields. Empirical yield model was developed between wheat yield and NDVI using CCE data. This model was used to compute the loss in state-level wheat production. This showed that there was a reduction of 8.4% in national wheat production. The production loss estimated through this method matched with the Government estimates.

The aims of this work were the following: (i) to understand the performances of different spectral dimension-reduced features from hyperspectral data and their combination with LiDAR derived height information in image segmentation; (ii) to understand what classification accuracies of crop species can be achieved by combining hyperspectral and LiDAR data in an OBIA paradigm, especially in regions that have fragmented agricultural landscape and complicated crop planting structure; and (iii) to understand the contributions of the crop height that is derived from LiDAR data, as well as the geometric and textural features of image objects, to the crop species' separabilities. The study region was an irrigated agricultural area in the central Heihe river basin, which is characterized by many crop species, complicated crop planting structures, and fragmented landscape. The airborne hyperspectral data acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) with a 1 m spatial resolution and the Canopy Height Model (CHM) data derived from the LiDAR data acquired by the airborne Leica ALS70 LiDAR system were used for this study. The image segmentation accuracies of different feature combination schemes (very high-resolution imagery (VHR), VHR/CHM, and minimum noise fractional transformed data (MNF)/CHM) were evaluated and analyzed. The results showed that VHR/CHM outperformed the other two combination schemes with a segmentation accuracy of 84.8%. The object-based crop species classification results of different feature integrations indicated that incorporating the crop height information into the hyperspectral extracted features provided a substantial increase in the classification accuracy. The combination of MNF and CHM produced higher classification accuracy than the combination of VHR and CHM, and the solely MNF-based classification results. The textural and geometric features in the object-based classification could significantly improve the accuracy of the crop species classification. By using the proposed object-based classification framework, a crop species classification result with an overall accuracy of 90.33% and a kappa of 0.89 was achieved in our study area.

AB To ensure future food security, improved agricultural management approaches are required. For many of those applications, precise knowledge of the distribution of crop types is essential. Various machine and deep learning models have been used for automated crop classification using microwave remote sensing time series. However, the application of these approaches on a large spatial and temporal scale is barely investigated. In this study, the performance of two frequently used algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF), for crop classification based on Sentinel-1 time series and meteorological data on a large spatial and temporal scale is assessed. For data from Austria, the Netherlands, and France and the years 2015-2019, scenarios with different spatial and temporal scales were defined. To quantify the complexity of these scenarios, the Fisher Discriminant measurement F1 (FDR1) was used. The results demonstrate that both classifiers achieve similar results for simple classification tasks with low FDR1 values. With increasing FDR1 values, however, LSTM networks outperform RF. This suggests that the ability of LSTM networks to learn long-term dependencies and identify the relation between radar time series and meteorological data becomes increasingly important for more complex applications. Thus, the study underlines the importance of deep learning models, including LSTM networks, for large-scale applications.

AB Remote sensing offers a way to map crop types across large spatio-temporal scales at low costs. However, mapping crop types is challenging in heterogeneous, smallholder farming systems, such as those in India, where field sizes are often smaller than the resolution of historically available imagery. In this study, we examined the potential of relatively new, high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope) to identify four major crop types (maize, mustard, tobacco, and wheat) in eastern India using support vector machine (SVM). We found that a trained SVM model that included all three sensors led to the highest classification accuracy (85%), and the inclusion of Planet data was particularly helpful for classifying crop types for the smallest farms (<600 m(2)). This was likely because its higher spatial resolution (3 m) could better account for field-level variations in smallholder systems. We also examined the impact of image timing on the classification accuracy, and we found that early-season images did little to improve our models. Overall, we found that readily available Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet imagery were able to map crop types at the field-scale with high accuracy in Indian smallholder systems. The findings from this study have important implications for the identification of the most effective ways to map crop types in smallholder systems.

AB We described, classified, and mapped the functional heterogeneity of temperate South America using the seasonal dynamics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from NOAA/AVHRR satellites for a 10-year period. From the seasonal curves of NDVI, we calculated (a) the annual integral (NDVI-1), used as an estimate of the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by the canopy and hence of primary production, (b) the relative annual range of NDVI (RREL), and (c) the date of maximum NDVI (MMAX), both of which were used to capture the seasonality of primary production. NDVI-1 decreased gradually from the northeastern part of the study region (southern Brazil and Uruguay) toward the southwest (Patagonia). High precipitation areas dominated by rangelands had higher NDVI-1 and lower RREL values than neighboring areas dominated by crops. The relative annual range of NDVI was maximum for the northern portion of the Argentine pampas (high cover of summer crops) and the subantarctic forests in southern Chile (high cover of deciduous tree species). More than 25% of the area showed an NDVI peak in November. Around 40% of the area presented the maximum NDVI during summer. The pampas showed areas with sharp differences in the timing of the NDVI peak associated with different agricultural systems. in the southern pampas, NDVI peaked early (October-November); whereas in the northeastern pampas, NDVI peaked in late summer (February). We classified temperate South America into 19 ecosystem functional types (EFT). The methodology used to define EFTs has advantages over traditional approaches for land classification that are based on structural features. First, the NDVI traits used have a clear biological meaning. Second, remote-sensing data are available worldwide. Third, the continuous record of satellite data allows for a dynamic characterization of ecosystems and land-cover changes.

AB Long-term temporal and spatial information of crop type supports a wide range of applications including hydrological and climatological studies. In the U.S., yearly crop data layers (CDLs) are available starting in the early 2000s and have been developed using combined field information and sets of temporal imagery from multiple sensors. Development of long-term crop-type layers similar to CDLs is restricted by reduced accessibility to imagery and the necessary auxiliary datasets. In this study, a procedure to generate a historical crop type was developed and evaluated. Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets from Landsat 5 TM sensor for the Lower Bear Creek watershed were collected and processed. Object-based pseudo phenology curves, represented by the NDVI time series, were generated using noise filtering and dimensionality standardization procedures for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Classifiers were developed and evaluated using random-forest machine learning algorithms and CDL datasets as the reference. Increased generalization performance was obtained when the model was developed using multi-year datasets. This can be attributed to improved crop type representation during the training phase coupled with characterization of yearly variations due to natural (weather) and anthropogenic factors (farming management). Source of uncertainties were the presence of multiple crops within objects, phenological similarities between soybean and corn/maize, and the accuracy of CDL itself. The proposed procedure supports the development of historic crop types for long-term studies at the field scale in agricultural watersheds.

AB The environmental and societal impacts of tropical cyclones could be reduced using a range of management initiatives. Remote sensing can be a cost effective, accurate, and potential tool for mapping the multiple impacts caused by tropical cyclones using high-to-moderate spatial resolution (5-30 m) satellite imagery to provide data on the following essential parameters - evacuation, relief, and management of natural resources. This study developed and evaluated an approach for assessing the impacts of tropical cyclones through object-based image analysis and moderate spatial resolution imagery. Pre-and post-cyclone maps of artificial and natural features are required for assessing the overall impacts in the landscape that could be acquired by mapping specific land cover types. We used the object-based approach to map land-cover types in pre-and post-cyclone Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 5 image data and the post-classification comparison technique to identify changes in the particular features in the landscape. Cyclone Sidr (2007) was used to test the applicability of this approach in Sarankhola Upazila in Bangladesh. The object-based approach provided accurate results for classifying features from pre-and post-cyclone satellite images with an overall accuracy of 95.43% and 93.27%, respectively. Mapped changes identified the extent, type, and form of cyclone induced impacts. Our results indicate that 63.15% of the study area was significantly affected by cyclone Sidr. The majority of mapped damage was found in vegetation, cropped lands, settlements, and infrastructure. The damage results were verified through the high spatial resolution satellite imagery, reports and pictures that were taken after the cyclone. The methods developed may be used in future to assess the multiple impacts caused by tropical cyclones in Bangladesh and other similar environments for the purposes of tropical cyclone disaster management.

AB Hyperspectral imagery has been widely used in precision agriculture due to its rich spectral characteristics. With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, the airborne hyperspectral imagery shows detailed spatial information and temporal flexibility, which open a new way to accurate agricultural monitoring. To extract crop types from the airborne hyperspectral images, we propose a fine classification method based on multi-feature fusion and deep learning. In this research, the morphological profiles, GLCM texture and endmember abundance features are leveraged to exploit the spatial information of the hyperspectral imagery. Then, the multiple spatial information is fused with the original spectral information to generate classification result by using the deep neural network with conditional random field (DNN+CRF) model. Specifically, the deep neural network (DNN) is a deep recognition model which can extract depth features and mine the potential information of data. As a discriminant model, conditional random field (CRF) considers both spatial and contextual information to reduce the misclassification noises while keeping the object boundaries. Moreover, three multiple feature fusion approaches, namely feature stacking, decision fusion and probability fusion, are taken into account. In the experiments, two airborne hyperspectral remote sensing datasets (Honghu dataset and Xiong'an dataset) are used. The experimental results show that the classification performance of the proposed method is satisfactory, where the salt and pepper noise is decreased, and the boundary of the ground object is preserved.

AB The accurate acquisition of farmland planting information is the basis of precision agriculture. Collecting remote sensing data via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a convenient method to obtain precision agricultural information because of the high spatiotemporal resolution and flexibility. A quadrotor UAV equipped with a SEQUOIA sensor (one multi-spectral sensor and one RGB lens) was operated over the Jingyuetan agricultural area with five land cover types on September 4, 2017, to investigate the equipment's feasibility for crop identification. To evaluate the effects of different data and classification methods on the accuracy of crop type classification, three combinations were tested: MDC + Four (Mahalanobis distance classifiers based on four-band reflectance), MDC + VIs (Mahalanobis distance classifiers based on Vegetation Indices) and MLC + VIs (maximum likelihood classifiers based on Vegetation Indices). The accuracy of the different classification methods was 83.06% (MDC + Four), 89.17% (MDC + VIs) and 92.60% (MLC + VIs). The MLC + VIs scheme was the most accurate, as it could partially overcome the influence of shadow and flattened. Since the reflectivity of different bands varied, all kinds of objects on the ground could be distinguished. This result revealed that multi-spectral UAV technology has the potential to identify crop type at the sub-meter spatial resolution, with the MLC based on the VIs.

AB Accurate measurements of maize yields at field or subfield scales are useful for guiding agronomic practices and investments and policies for improving food security. Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build "wall-to-wall" 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions.
   First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/nonmaize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015-2017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85% out-of sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79% in Tanzania and 63% in Kenya.
   To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50% of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts.
   Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72%) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels. Overall, this study illustrates the power of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the GEE platform, and advanced classification and yield mapping algorithms to advance understanding of smallholder agricultural systems.

AB Remote sensing and GIS are often used to assess spatiotemporal variations for land use/land cover (LULC) monitoring and classification. While LULC monitoring and classification has been undertaken in Eswatini, little attention has been given to ascertaining covered thematic areas, methods of image classification, and approaches and techniques for improving classification accuracy. This paper summarises and synthesizes the progress made in the Kingdom of Eswatini regarding the application of remote sensing and GIS in LULC monitoring and classification. Eight thematic areas (water resources mapping; land degradation; forestry; wildfire detection; urban expansion; crop production; disease surveillance; general mapping) dominate evaluated LULC studies, employing three LULC classification methods (classic; manual; advanced). While some studies include strengths and weaknesses of LULC classification techniques applied, others do not. This review shows that only two advanced classifiers (random forest; object-based) were identified from the reviewed articles. In addition, reviewed studies applied only two approaches (use of multi temporal data; fine spatial resolution data) and three techniques (use of ancillary data; post-classification procedure; the use of multisource data) for improving classification accuracy. Furthermore, the review finds that limited LULC investigations have been covered in Eswatini with a specific focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, this review recommends 1) the inclusion of higher resolution imagery for mapping purposes, 2) the adaptation of strengths and weaknesses for any image classification technique employed in future publications, 3) the use of more varied approaches and techniques for improving classification accuracy and area estimates, 4) inclusion of standard errors or confidence intervals for error-adjusted area estimates as part of accuracy assessment reporting, 5) the application of advanced image classifiers, and 6) the application of Earth Observation (EO) Analysis Ready Data (ARD) in the production of information for the support of the SDGs.

AB Maize straw is a valuable renewable energy source. The rapid and accurate determination of its yield and spatial distribution can promote improved utilization. At present, traditional straw estimation methods primarily rely on statistical analysis that may be inaccurate. In this study, the Gaofen 6 (GF-6) satellite, which combines high resolution and wide field of view (WFV) imaging characteristics, was used as the information source, and the quantity of maize straw resources and spatial distribution characteristics in Qihe County were analyzed. According to the phenological characteristics of the study area, seven classification classes were determined, including maize, buildings, woodlands, wastelands, water, roads, and other crops, to explore the influence of sample separation and test the responsiveness to different land cover types with different waveband combinations. Two supervised classification methods, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were used to classify the study area, and the influence of the newly added band of GF-6 WFV on the classification accuracy of the study area was analyzed. Furthermore, combined with field surveys and agricultural census data, a method for estimating the quantity of maize straw and analyzing the spatial distribution based on a single-temporal remote sensing image and random forests was proposed. Finally, the accuracy of the measurement results is evaluated at the county level. The results showed that the RF model made better use of the newly added bands of GF-6 WFV and improved the accuracy of classification, compared with the SVM model; the two red-edge bands improved the accuracy of crop classification and recognition; the purple and yellow bands identified non-vegetation more effectively than vegetation, thus minimizing the "salt-and-pepper noise" of classification results. However, the changes to total classification accuracy were not obvious; the theoretical quantity of maize straw in Qihe County in 2018 was 586.08 kt, which reflects an error of only 2.42% compared to the statistical result. Hence, the RF model based on single-temporal GF-6 WFV can effectively estimate regional maize straw yield and spatial distribution, which lays a theoretical foundation for straw recycling.

AB In order to examine the accuracy of large amount of the field survey data with less accurate, an examination method based on multi-resolution satellite images was proposed in this paper. As there were so large amount of data, stratified random sampling was used to obtain effective samples. Firstly, vegetation index derived from low-resolution satellite images at different times has been adopted as analysis factor. And wave curve charts were drawn with the vegetation index. From those charts, the statistics law of wave curves for different crop types was recognized using for crop types' classification. Secondly, high-resolution satellite images were used to correct the area of crop types to get the final classification results. Finally, the accuracy of the field survey data can be calculated by comparing the original survey data with the final classification results. Moreover, for convenience using, a software has been developed according to the above examination method.

AB Accurate field-level mapping of rapeseed spatial distributions using remote sensing technology supports agricultural planning, food and edible oil security, and ecological system management. The phenological and spectral methods for rapeseed mapping mainly rely on optical images collected during the flowering period. However, these images are often occluded by clouds. Moreover, the scarcity of well-represented training samples with various phenology patterns constrains large-scale supervised classification and extraction of rapeseed. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Seamless and Automated Rapeseed Mapping (SARM) method using time-series optical satellite imagery for large cloudy regions to generate seamless rapeseed maps at field scale without any manually collected samples. First, a Winter Rapeseed Index (WRI) was designed to automatically extract rapeseed in cloud-free areas by enhancing the phenological separability of rapeseed. Second, a multiple random forest-based fusion mapping framework was developed using WRI-based training samples, and was applied for the cloudy regions to map rapeseed seamlessly across the whole study area. The proposed SARM method was validated under different years, sensors, and cropping patterns at four study sites both in China and the USA. Extensive experimental results and analysis suggest that the SARM method outperforms other traditional methods on all four study sites with an average overall accuracy varying from 88.58% to 98.78%. These results also reveal that our proposed approach is capable of expanding the time windows for rapeseed mapping from the significant flowering period to the insignificant flowering period. More importantly, the spatial incompleteness of rapeseed maps caused by cloud contamination was mitigated to some degree. The SARM method robustly delivers seamless and automated rapeseed mapping by using time-series optical satellite imagery, thus offering new insights for crop investigation, especially in large cloudy regions.

AB Land-cover datasets are crucial for research on eco-hydrological processes and earth system modeling. Many land-cover datasets have been derived from remote-sensing data. However, their spatial resolutions are usually low and their classification accuracy is not high enough, which are not well suited to the needs of land surface modeling. Consequently, a comprehensive method for monthly land-cover classification in the Heihe river basin (HRB) with high spatial resolution is developed. Moreover, the major crops in the HRB are also distinguished. The proposed method integrates multiple classifiers and multisource data. Three types of data including MODIS, HJ-1/CCD, and Landsat/TM and Google Earth images are used. Compared to single classifier, multiple classifiers including thresholding, support vector machine (SVM), object-based method, and time-series analysis are integrated to improve the accuracy of classification. All the data and classifiers are organized using a decision tree. Monthly land-cover maps of the HRB in 2013 with 30-m spatial resolution are made. A comprehensive validation shows great improvement in the accuracy. First, a visual comparison of the land-cover maps using the proposed method and standard SVM method shows the classification differences and the advantages of the proposed method. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the classification accuracy, showing an overall classification accuracy of over 90% in the HRB, which is quite higher than previous approaches. Furthermore, a ground campaign was performed to evaluate the accuracy of crop classification and an overall accuracy of 84.09% for the crop classification was achieved.

AB The oil palm is an important agro-industrial commodity in Colombia and this kind of crops is severely affected by different diseases. Specifically, the But Rot is the most common disease in oil palm crops. Traditionally, the diagnosis and control of diseases in oil palm crops is an invasive process that requires a time-consuming analysis. Therefore, an automatic classification task is required for identifying this kind of disease. On one hand, hyperspectral images (HSI) are used as a remote sensing tool that allows the identification of different features in a land cover, including diseases in crops and materials. However, the HSI classification is a challenging task, due to the spectral signature is typically associated with a unique class, and consequently, it causes low accuracy on classification results. In other words, most of HSI classification methods do not consider the contributions of one or more materials in the measured spectral pixel, leading to a multiclass model at sub-pixel levels. To address this limitation, spectral unmixing (SU) approach has been used to estimate the contributions of the different materials covered by a pixel. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated great a performance in classification tasks using HSI. In this work, a classification approach of the But Rot disease in oil palm is proposed by using SU and CNN through HSI. The architecture of the proposed classifier contains 5 layers which are two convolutional layers, two ReLu layer, and one full connected layer. Simulations results show that the proposed classification method exhibits the best classification performance in terms of the overall accuracy, achieving up 88:7861% using only 20% of the training samples, compared to traditional classification approaches.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing data have great potential for plant classification, monitoring, and mapping due to their considerable spectral information. A spectral library can be used for the automatic interpretation of remote sensing data, which is an efficient tool for the classification of plant species. Given that similar spectral signatures are usually found among different plant species, it is critical to identify plant-sensitive spectral features when constructing a robust plant spectral library. This study proposed an approach to the establishment and application of a plant spectral library based on spectral data from ground objects. It included a spectral feature screening method for plant spectral response and a feature robustness analysis method suitable for monitoring, while unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging data was used to validate mapping results. This study was divided into an urban scenario and an agricultural scenario based on plant composition, and a set of spectral feature sensitivity methods based on Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) and Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance was proposed. At the same time, a robust spectral analysis method was developed based on illumination and noise disturbance. The performance of K-nearest neighbour algorithm (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine coupled with a Genetic Algorithm (GA-SVM) for plant classification modelling were compared. Results showed that the spectral indices obtained by sensitivity and robustness screening were effective for plant classification, and the GA-SVM model had the highest accuracy with overall accuracy (OAA) = 0.98, Kappa = 0.98 in the urban scenario, and OAA = 0.97, Kappa = 0.97 in the agricultural scenario. In addition, pixel-based crop classification validation based on UAV hyperspectral imaging also had high accuracy, and the plot level classification results were in good agreement with field survey results. Therefore, it is feasible to use a plant spectral library to assist in monitoring and mapping of plant species using hyperspectral remote sensing images at large scales. The effects of plant growth status, growth stage, and other changes on classification should be further studied. (C) 2020 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying crop residue cover is crucial for identifying tillage intensity and evaluating effectiveness of conservation management practices across large geographic areas. Current assessment protocols are labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. Our objective was to assess crop residue cover and soil tillage intensity in a watershed in central Iowa for three years (2009 to 2011) using multispectral satellite images. The watershed is dominated by corn (Zen mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), which are grown on glacial-till derived soils across 85% of the land area. For each year, crop residue cover was measured for a few fields using the line-point transect method or visually estimating surface cover through roadside surveys. Conservation tillage fields had >= 30% residue cover, while more intensively tilled fields had <30% residue cover. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Geometrical (HRG), Indian ResourceSat Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and Deimos satellite images were also acquired and analyzed to determine surface cover. SPOT and Landsat images provided similar classification accuracy ranging from 64% to 92%, while AWiFS and Deimos classifications had accuracies ranging from 61% to 73%. Clouds and the revisit interval for each satellite affected the timing of satellite images with respect to field operations, which also influenced classification accuracy. Overall soil tillage intensity varied little from year-to-year. Soil tillage intensity was also mapped as a function of slope, which could be useful for targeting additional conservation practices throughout the watershed. We conclude that satellite imagery is well suited for classifying crop residue cover. Furthermore, two recently launched satellites, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, have comparable multispectral sensors and together these satellites should provide frequent opportunities to acquire suitable imagery for assessing crop residue cover and soil tillage intensity over large geographic areas.

AB Some new vegetation models for hyperspectral remote sensing are provided in this paper. They are Derivative Spectral Model (DSM), Multi-temporal Index Image Cube Model (MIIC). Hybrid Decision Tree Model (HDT) and Correlation Simulating Analysis Model (CSAM). All models are developed and used to process the images acquired by Airborne Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI) in Changzhou area, China, 1999. Some successful applications are provided and evaluated. The results show that DSM has the ability of eliminating the background interference of vegetation analysis. MIIC is a viable method for monitoring dynamic change of land cover and vegetation growth stages. HDT is effective in precise classification of rice land while CSAM provide a possibility and theoretical basis for crop identification, breed classification, and land information extraction especially for rice.

AB The forth IPCC report pointed out grain production as one of the highest vulnerability by which climate change is expected to impart the most severe effects. The recent concern about food scarcity motivates the development of the present system named Remote Sensing Environmental Monitor (RSEM) for crop yield monitoring. The authors have developed a photosynthesis model for rice production to address such issues. The system includes a photosynthetic sterility yield model using meteorological re-analysis data and precise land use and cover (LULC) classification of crop field in Asian countries. The validation concept is based on the fact that the carbon hydrate in grains has the same chemical formula as cellulose in grain vegetation. The both photosynthesis and sterility models are validated by carbon partitioning method associated with particular rice species in Japan and China.

ID CROP-HAIL DAMAGE
AB Assessing hail and wind damage to crops is a difficult, labor-intensive task. A quick and accurate method of determining losses could lead to better crop management decisions, more accurate insurance claim adjustment, and reduced expenses for the crop hail insurance industry. Radiometric data were collected in 1997, 1998, and 1999 in Indiana and Nebraska from field plots of maize, Zea mays L., Subjected to varying levels of damage. Incremental differences in plant damage resulted in incremental differences in spectral responses. The red and near-infrared spectral bands provided the most discrimination among levels of damage. Classification of remotely sensed images by damage level was performed by extrapolating spectral information from areas where damage levels were known to adjacent unknown areas of damage. Depending on location. sensor, and date of data collection, it was possible to classify the degree of early-season stand loss at accuracies of 48 to 100 percent. For leaf loss during the late vegetative stages, it was possible to classify the degree of leaf loss at accuracies of 81 to 100 percent and, for leaf loss during the early reproductive stages, it was possible to classify damage at accuracies of 71 to 98 percent. These results indicate that remote sensing could be used to improve the accuracy of estimating crop damage as long as adequate ground reference for different levels of crop damage exists.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral systems can acquire hyperspectral imagery with a high spatial resolution (which we refer to here as H2 imagery). As a result of the low operating cost, high flexibility, and the ability to achieve real-time data acquisition, UAV-borne hyperspectral systems have become an im-portant data source for remote sensing based agricultural monitoring. However, precise crop classification based on UAV-borne H2 imagery is a challenging task when faced with a number of different crop classes. The traditional hyperspectral classification methods, such as the spectral-based and object-oriented classification methods, have difficulty in classifying H2 imagery, faced with the problems of salt-and-pepper (SP) noise and scale selection. In this article, the deep convolutional neural network with a conditional random field classifier (CNNCRF) framework is proposed for precise crop classification with UAV-borne H2 imagery. In the proposed method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract and fuse in-depth spectral and local spatial features, and the conditional random field (CRF) model further incorporates the spatial-contextual information to improve the problem of holes and isolated regions in the classification map. Meanwhile, virtual sample augmentation based on the hyperspectral imaging mechanism is used to lessen the issue of the limited labeled samples. To validate the results, a new dataset-the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset-has been built for precise crop classification. The experimental results obtained using the WHU-Hi dataset confirm the accuracy and visualization performance of the proposed CNNCRF classification method, which outperforms the previous methods. In addition, the WHU-Hi dataset could serve as a benchmark dataset for hyperspectral image classification studies.

AB Cropland maps are useful for the management of agricultural fields and the estimation of harvest yield. Some local governments have documented field properties, including crop type and location, based on site investigations. This process, which is generally done manually, is labor-intensive, and remote-sensing techniques can be used as alternatives. In this study, eight crop types (beans, beetroot, grass, maize, potatoes, squash, winter wheat, and yams) were identified using gamma naught values and polarimetric parameters calculated from TerraSAR-X (or TanDEM-X) dual-polarimetric (HH/VV) data. Three indices (difference (D-type), simple ratio (SR), and normalized difference (ND)) were calculated using gamma naught values and m-chi decomposition parameters and were evaluated in terms of crop classification. We also evaluated the classification accuracy of four widely used machine-learning algorithms (kernel-based extreme learning machine, support vector machine, multilayer feedforward neural network (FNN), and random forest) and two multiple-kernel methods (multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) and multiple kernel learning (MKL)). MKL performed best, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.1%, and proved useful for the identification of crops with small sample sizes. The difference (raw or normalized) between double-bounce scattering and odd-bounce scattering helped to improve the identification of squash and yams fields.

AB Multi-sensor remote sensing data fusion technologies have been developed and widely applied in recent years, providing a feasible and economical solution to increase the availability of high spatial and temporal resolution data. These methods, however, have been challenging to apply in highly heterogeneous areas, especially in complex agricultural landscapes where there are rapid changes at small scales, while features at larger scales change more slowly. In this study, we developed a novel method to reconstruct daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat and Landsat-like platforms, and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). This method utilizes a crop reference curve (CRC) approach, in which a set of NDVI time series are extracted from pure MODIS pixels (250 m resolution) identified using the CDL, and then used to fit Landsat-like observations (30 m). The CRC based method was applied over a complex agricultural landscape in the Choptank River watershed on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Landsat data from 2013 and 2014 and Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data from 2018 were used to reconstruct 30 m daily NDVI maps for major crop types. Results show that the relative error (RE) in reconstructed NDVI is around 6-8% during periods of rapid crop growth, and 3-5% during peak periods when growth is slow. The accuracy of the CRC method outperforms a standard image pair-based data fusion algorithm (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model; STARFM), which yields RE of 4-9% in slow-growth periods and 10-16% in fast-growth periods when clear Landsat images are scarce. The CRC method was also compared with time-series data fusion methods, including a harmonic fitting model and the SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR) model. The results show that CRC gives similar results when the Landsat-like image availability is high (around 27 images per year), but outperforms other methods when availability is limited (less than 15 images per year). The reconstructed NDVI time series for corn, soybean, winter wheat/soybean and forest at 30-m resolution show clear phenological patterns at the sub-field scale. The resulting 30-m NDVI timeseries data provide useful information for mapping crop phenology and monitoring crop condition in complex agricultural landscapes, especially for complex double-cropping areas. However, the input requirement of an accurate 30-m crop classification map constrains its application to areas and periods where classifications are available.

AB Most of China's rice production is located in the southern provinces of the country where frequent cloudy conditions hinder the successful acquisition of optical imagery. Small field sizes and complex planting patterns pose additional challenges to crop mapping using remote sensing approaches. High resolution radar data are most suitable for operational monitoring of crops in this region of China. In this study, the suitability of high-resolution TerraSAR-X StripMap data (6 m resolution) for identification of rice was investigated for a site in Xuwen, Guangdong Province, China. An integrated decision tree and object-oriented classification approach was used. The results showed that higher rice identification accuracies can be obtained using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data at the tillering, jointing and flowering periods. Both the VV and VH polarizations provided accurate rice identification.

AB Mapping and monitoring land use land cover (LULC) dynamics is vital for sustainable land development, planning and management. Using advanced techniques of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), the present study is an effort to monitor the changes in LULC patterns of Jhansi District of Uttar Pradesh for the periods 2000-2010 and 2010-2020. Satellite images from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) for 2001; Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) for 2010 and Landsat 8 (OLI) for 2020 were used to extract Land use/Land cover classes. Supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) was applied to monitor LULC of the study area. Six major LULC classes viz; cropland, fallow/barren land, built-up area, water bodies and forest have been identified and showed that major land use in the district is crop land. The accuracy assessment of the classified map was done using 256 random points distributed all over the image. Results indicated that LULC in Jhansi district has undergone a series of changes over the past two decades. Results showed that crop land, built-up area and water bodies have increased by 27.16% (1367.26 Km(2)), 0.58% (29.4 Km(2)) and 0.3% (15.26 Km(2)), respectively while fallow/barren land and forest have decreased by 27.55% (1386.58 Km(2)), and 0.5% (25.34 Km(2)), respectively. The research revealed that substantial shift from fallow/ barren land (27.55%) into crop land. The analysis and findings of this study facilitate researchers, policy makers, land use planners and managers to implement the appropriate land-use management plan for Jhansi district.

AB Accurate information on land use and land cover (LULC) is critical for policy decisions especially for management of land and water resources' activities in large river basins around the world. Phenology based LULC classification is the most promising approach particularly in the areas with diversified cropping patterns. Sometimes in large river basins, local climate and topography provides two different phenological information sets for the same crops in the same season. Based on accurate phenological information of the main crops in spatially segregated units, the remote sensing based classification was used to map the LULC changes for a period of 2003-2013 in the Kabul River Basin (KRB) of Afghanistan. We used remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products of Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from Terra (MOD13Q1) and Aqua (MYD13Q1) with 250 m spatial resolution for this study. The overall accuracy (mean) of the LULC classification throughout the study period was around 68.15% +/- 9.45 while the producer and user accuracies (mean) were 75.9 +/- 113% and 76.4 +/- 11.2%, respectively. Results show that the cropping patterns vary significantly in the spatially disaggregated units. From 2003 till 2013, the ground coverage of wheat, barley and rice was increased by 31%, 7% and 32%, respectively. Overall, there has been only 2% increment in the agricultural area across the KRB between 2003 and 2013. This relatively increased trend of land cover change has taken place as a result of partial improvement in political stability as well as investment in irrigation infrastructure and agricultural development in the region. This study further provides insight to develop new agriculture strategies in order to maintain the ecosystem required to fulfil the rising food demands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Crop disease detection with remote sensing is a challenging area that can have significant economic and environmental impact on crop disease management. Spectroscopic remote sensing in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region has the potential to detect crop changes due to diseases. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and sudden death syndrome (SDS) are two common soybean diseases that are extremely difficult to detect in the early stages under mild to moderate infestation levels. The objective of this research study was to relate leaf reflectance to disease conditions and to identify wavebands that best discriminated these crop diseases. A microplot experiment was conducted. Data collected included 800 leaf spectra, corresponding leaf chlorophyll content and disease rating of four soybean cultivars grown under different disease conditions. Disease conditions were created by introducing four disease treatments of control ( no disease), SCN, SDS, and SCN+SDS. Crop data were collected on a weekly basis over a 10-week period, starting from 71 days after planting (DAP). The correlation between disease rating and selected vegetation indices ( VI) were evaluated. Wavebands with the most disease discrimination capability were identified with stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic discriminant analysis (LgDA) and linear correlation analysis of pooled data. The identified band combinations were used to develop a classification function to identify plant disease condition. The best correlation (>0.8) between disease rating and VI occurred during 112 DAP. Both LDA and LgDA identified several bands in the NIR, red, green and blue regions as critical for disease discrimination. The discriminant models were able to detect over 80% of the healthy plants accurately under cross-validation but showed poor accuracy in discriminating individual diseases. A two-class discriminant model was able to identify 97% of the healthy plants and 58% of the infested plants as having some disease from the plant spectra.

AB Numerous studies have reported the use of multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing images to map irrigated crops. Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development. In conclusion, compared to a "full optical" approach, the "combined" method is more robust over time as radar images permit cloudy conditions to be overcome.

TI Spatial simulation modelling of land use/land cover change scenarios in
   northeastern Thailand: a cellular automata approach
SO JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE

AB The cultivation of upland field crops, primarily cassava and sugar cane, in Nang Rong district, northeast Thailand, beginning in the mid-to late 1960s, has helped transform a once forest-dominated landscape to one dominated by agriculture. Today, paddy rice is cultivated throughout the lowlands, field crops and a fragmented forest matrix comprise the uplands, and fruit trees, rubber plantations, and vegetable gardens are among the crops dispersed around nuclear villages. Distributed along a topographic terrace system, upland and lowland crops are cultivated relative to environmental and economic opportunities and geographic access, although crops grown in marginal settings may not be sustainable. Relying upon a remote sensing image time-series, a longitudinal social survey, and GIS coverages, a cellular automata (CA) model is described that is used to characterize land use and land cover (LULC) change patterns through specified initial conditions, neighbourhood associations, and transition or growth rules. Results of four scenarios or experiments are described that perturb the base LULC change model of cassava, forest, and rice by imposing production quotas in the cultivation of cassava. Derived for the period 1972-2001, CA model results for the scenarios are compared to a time-series of Landsat satellite classifications of LULC using images of simulation runs and plots that describe trends in the composition and spatial organisation of cassava, forest, and rice for each scenario. Results are interpreted within a population-environment context in which people, place, and environment are integrated in complex ways. The demise of forest at the expense of expanded lowland paddy rice and upland field crops is a central story of the region. Quotas on the production of cassava alter the trajectories of forest change and result in more consolidated forest stands over the period of the simulations. Cassava consolidation and in-filling in the extensive uplands of the southwest portion of Nang Rong district is a persistent outcome of the simulations for the various scenarios tested.

ID DISCRIMINATION
AB The present study was undertaken with the objective to check effectiveness of spectral information divergence (SID) to develop spectra from image for crop classes based on spectral similarity with field spectra. In multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing, classification of pixels is obtained by statistical comparison (by means of spectral similarity) of known field or library spectra to unknown image spectra. Though these algorithms are readily used, little emphasis has been placed on use of various spectral similarity measures to develop crop spectra from the image itself. Hence, in this study methodology suggested to develop spectra for crops based on SID. Absorption features are unique and distinct; hence, validation of the developed spectra is carried out using absorption features by comparing it with field spectra and finding average correlation coefficient r=0.982 and computed SID equivalent r=0.989. Effectiveness of developed spectra for image classification was computed by probability of spectral discrimination (PSD) and resulted in higher probability for the spectra developed based on SID. Image classification was carried out using field spectra and spectra assigned by SID. Overall classification accuracy of the image classified by field spectra is 78.30% and for the image classified by spectra assigned through SID-based approach is 91.82%. Z test shows that image classification carried out using spectra developed by SID is better than classification carried out using field spectra and significantly different. Validation by absorption features, effectiveness by PSD and higher classification accuracy show possibility of new approach for spectra development based on SID spectral similarity measure.

AB Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, one of the major diseases infecting oilseed rape leaves, has seriously affected crop yield and quality. In this study, an indoor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low-altitude remote sensing simulation platform was built for disease detection. Thermal, multispectral and RGB images were acquired before and after being artificially inoculated with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on oilseed rape leaves. New image registration and fusion methods based on scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) were presented to construct a fused database using multi-model images. The changes of temperature distribution in different sections of infected areas were analyzed by processing thermal images, the maximum temperature difference (MTD) on a single leaf reached 1.7 degrees Celsius 24 h after infection. Four machine learning models were established using thermal images and fused images respectively, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and naive Bayes (NB). The results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was improved by 11.3% after image fusion, and the SVM model obtained a classification accuracy of 90.0% on the task of classifying disease severity. The overall results indicated the UAV low-altitude remote sensing simulation platform equipped with multi-sensors could be used to early detect Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on oilseed rape leaves.

AB In the 1990s foi-estland in panda's habitat, Southwest China Mountains, underwent rapid degradation since the natural forest was converted into agricultural land. Remote sensing technology has not only provided a id representation of forestland's surface but also become an efficient source of thematic maps such as the deforestation in this area. Landsat-5) TM data in 1994 and Landsat-7 TM data in 2002 are available for detecting the forestland degradation in the study area. The foggy, cloudy and snowy weather and mountainous landscape make it difficult to acquire remotely sensed data with high quality in panda's habitat. Supervised classification is performed in the image process and a Maximum-likelihood classification (MLC) is applied using the spectral signatures from the training sites. According to the topographical and meteorological conditions, different training sites are created such as forest-forest, river valley, forest, crop, town, water, snow, cloud, shadow and non-forest. As the result, forestland degradation map provides much information for forest degradation. Classification accuracy assessment is carried out by ERDAS software and the over-all classification accuracy is up to 82.81%.

AB The use of knowledge-based systems (KBSs) that use evidential reasoning for land-cover mapping derived from remotely sensed images is spreading widely. In recent years, KBSs utilizing the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (D-S ToE) have been found most successful in a wide range of remote sensing applications, partly because of their ability to combine diverse information sources. An important feature of the D-S ToE is that it provides a measure for the evidential support (belief) accumulated for each object class at each pixel. Despite the importance of cumulative belief values (CBVs) in representing the weighting of supportive versus conflicting evidence for each class, their analysis has received little attention in the literature. The objective of the present study was to assess the performance (represented by the kappa coefficient) of a KBS based on D-S ToE and of an unsupervised classification (ISODATA), with relation to the CBV distribution determined for each class. This was done for the task of crop recognition in a wide heterogeneous region in Israel. It was found that while KBS performs very well in cases of conflicts and moderate support, the US classification performed well only in cases of homogeneity and uniqueness. Crop recognition by means of KBS was applied to almost one-third of the country's agricultural areas, and it provided a high level of differentiation among seven crop types, orchards and natural vegetation types.

AB This paper uses semivariogram to quantify the crop spatial pattern from ERS-2 SAR image, especially for the cotton field, to improve the extraction accuracy for cotton growth monitoring. Measuring the influence of the semivariogram calculation variable can understand and control the calculation variable for remote sensing classification better. The crops semivariograms of study area exhibit a similar bounded shape resulting the regularization effect, the sill reaches at about 12 pixel, 150 m, the mean size of agricultural fields in the studied area. In this agricultural landscape, spatial structure results mainly from cultivation patterns. The cotton and maize semivariograms are quit e different distinctively. The semivariogram of each class reflects the texture characters, it measures the each class spatial structure and similarity relative to the size and direction of calculation window, which has different effect on the results of classification. We can select the window size according to the range of each class. Joining the classification with the average value for the four direction semivariograms can reduce the band numbers and classification time and elevate the accuracy. The results in study area indicate combining average semivariogram and spectrum in classification elevates 12.4% on overall accuracy compared to spectrum only.

AB Crop acreage monitoring is basic information necessary for wise management of plant natural resources. Recent developments in remote sensing technologies have created promising opportunities for improving agricultural statistics systems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one detector board on Terra's (EOS-AM1), which was lunched on December 18, 1999 by NASA. It offers a unique combination of spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution compared to previous global sensors, making it a good candidate for large-scale crop acreage estimating. However; because of subpixel heterogeneity, the application of traditional hard classification approaches to MODIS data may result in significant errors in crop area estimation, especially in China. This paper developed and tested an unmixing approach with MODIS data that estimates subpixel fractions of crop area based on the temporal signature of reflectance throughout the growing season. A zone that can get LANDSAT/TM data was chosen to be train dataset in this method. The paper assumes that the crop area estimating from LANDSAT/TM data is correct; in the training zone the crop area based on MODIS data can get from the classification result of LANDSAT/TM data. Then we can extend the result to a large-scale; finally we compare the result to national statistic data. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of subpixel heterogeneity in cropland systems, and the potential of temporal unmixing to provide accurate and rapid assessments of crop distributions using MODIS data.

TI Mapping of North Sinai land cover according to FAO-LCCS

DE Land cover mapping; LCCS system
AB Land cover map of North Sinai was produced based on the FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) of 2004. The standard FAO classification scheme provides a standardized system of classification that can be used to analyze spatial and temporal land cover variability in the study area. This approach also has the advantage of facilitating the integration of Sinai land cover mapping products to be included with the regional and global land cover datasets. The total study area is covering a total area of 20,310.4 km 2 (203,104 hectare). The landscape classification was based on SPOT4 data acquired in 2011 using combined multispectral bands of 20 m spatial resolution. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to manipulate the attributed layers of classification in order to reach the maximum possible accuracy. GIS was also used to include all necessary information. The identified vegetative land cover classes of the study area are irrigated herbaceous crops, irrigated tree crops and rain fed tree crops. The non-vegetated land covers in the study area include bare rock, bare soils (stony, very stony and salt crusts), loose and shifting sands and sand dunes. The water bodies were classified as artificial perennial water bodies (fish ponds and irrigated canals) and natural perennial water bodies as lakes (standing). The artificial surfaces include linear and non-linear features. (C) 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B. V. on behalf of National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB Time-series vegetation and water indices derived from remote sensing images are crucial materials for farmland analysis based on crop phenology and monitoring such as classification of cropping patterns and monitoring of crop growth and productivities. However, the optical remote-sensing images often contain problematic pixels, such as those affected by thick clouds and its shadows, resulting a noisy time-series data which is inadequate to use for farmland analysis. Lack of the high quality noiseless time-series data products have been a bottleneck for many studies on farmland analysis using remote-sensing data in both of global and local scales. Hence we aims in this study to produce remote-sensing data archives containing noiseless smoothed time-series Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and RGB composite (true color) image, covering global wide with the adequately downscaled 250-m resolution in 8-days interval from the period of 2000 to 2014 and up-to-date, derived from based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor images. The processing system for generating the global noiseless time-series data in this study is consist of four modules; image acquisition, preprocessing, noise reduction, and data archiving, implemented in Interactive Data Language (IDL) with PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing). Data products are derived from two sets of Terra/MODIS surface-reflectance 8-day composite data (MOD09Q1 v005 (250-m resolution) and MOD09A1 v005 (500-m resolution)) acquired from LP DAAC (Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center, USGS) on a regular basis automatically to update the latest products. To generate noiseless and smooth time-series data, we applied following well-established procedure: 1) Eliminate cloud and sensor noise pixels by referring the image quality information: 2) Reconstruct daily time-series data by referring the actual date of observation for each pixels: 3) Synthesize daily time-series Terra and Aqua: 4) Interpolate eliminated pixel value on time-series axis by liner interpolation method: 5) Apply the Savitzky-Golay filtering to time-series data to produce smoothed time-series data. Denoised true color image can be used for visually checking the quality of noise reduction. Data products are mapped by MODIS Sinusoidal Tiling System, and archived with Hierarchical Data Format-Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format containing various meta-information, which are the standard archive format for MODIS Land products distributed by USGS, so that users can use existing favorite tools such the MODIS Reprojection Tool (MRT) for handling the archives. The advanced noiseless time-series vegetation and water indices data archives produced in this study would contribute significantly to advanced analysis and monitoring of the crop production.

AB Rice is a crop of global importance. To predict the area of paddy rice and thus its production, it draws great attraction of using data mining approaches on remote sensing data, which are well accepted. Many approaches based on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques have been developed over the years. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm with a clustering technique is one of the most popular swarm-based algorithms. In this study, ABC algorithm is used to perform the rice image classification based on remote sensing imagery. This study comprises two stages. In the first part of the study, the ancillary information composed from the original spectra is applied to increase the performance of classification. As the other parts of the study, an efficient unsupervised classifier is developed to evaluate the performance of the incorporated ancillary information. This study integrates the ABC algorithm into a clustering process to build a land cover classifier system. On the other hand, a parallel approach using ant colony optimization (ACO) is studied for comparison. Two significant contributions are presented in this study: (1) a paddy rice image classifier is built with ABC algorithm and (2) the outcome of classifier using ABC algorithm outperforms that using ACO algorithm.

AB This study refers to develop a semi-automatic extraction of agricultural land use and vegetation information using high resolution satellite images. Data of IKONOS-2 satellite images (May 25 of 2001, December 25 of 2001, and October 23 of 2003), QuickBird-2 satellite images (May 1 of 2006 and November 17 of 2004) and KOMPSAT-2 satellite image (September 17 of 2007) which resemble with the spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of KOMPSAT-3 were used. The precise agricultural land use classification was tried using ISODATA unsupervised classification technique, and the result was compared with on-screen digitizing land use accompanying with field investigation. For the extraction of crop growth information, three crops of paddy, corn and red pepper were selected, and the spectral characteristics were collected during each growing period using ground spectroradiometer. The vegetation indices viz. RVI, NDVI, ARVI, and SAVI for the crops were evaluated. The evaluation process was developed using the ERDAS IMAGINE Spatial Modeler Tool.

AB A simple land cover classification scheme is proposed based on energy absorption and exchange properties of various land cover types, observable from remote sensing. Seasonal trajectories of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-s), routinely available from NOAA/AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer), are used to characterize different land cover types into four groups: water limited (shrub, grass), energy limited (wetlands, boreal forests, snow, ice, and water), atmospherically coupled (aerodynamically rough canopies, forests), and atmospherically decoupled (aerodynamically smooth canopies, crops). Further separation is achieved using growing-season average NDVI for shrub and grass, seasonal NDVI amplitude for deciduous vs. evergreen, and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance for broadleaf vs. needleleaf vegetation.
   The methodology using threshold-based rules is completely remote sensing based; classification rules are simple and easily modifiable. A first test of this logic over the continental United States, when compared with existing maps, showed that the methodology adequately captures the spatial distribution of various land cover types. The logic is also useful for monitoring seasonal dynamics of land cover, evapotranspiration, and disturbances due to fire, floods, insects/disease, and other anthropogenic processes. Future improvements needed to deal with mixed landscapes and global implementation details are discussed.

AB Many approaches have been developed to analyze remote sensing images. However, for the classification of large-scale problems, most algorithms showed low computational efficiency and low accuracy. In this paper, the newly developed semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM) framework with k-means clustering algorithm for image segmentation and co-training algorithm to enlarge the sample sets was used to classify the agricultural planting structure at large-scale areas. Data sets collected from a small-scale area within the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) at the upper reaches of the Yellow River basin were used to evaluate the SS-ELM framework. The results of the SS-ELM algorithm were compared with those of the random forest (RF), ELM, support vector machine (SVM) and semi-supervised support vector machine (S-SVM) algorithms. Then the SS-ELM algorithm was applied to analyze the complex planting structure of HID in 1986-2010 by comparing the remote sensing estimated results with the statistical data. In the small-scale case, the SS-ELM algorithm performed better than the RF, ELM, SVM, and S-SVM algorithms. For the SS-ELM algorithm, the average overall accuracy (OA) was in a range of 83.00-92.17%. On the contrary, for the other four algorithms, their average OA values ranged from 56.97% to 92.84%. Whereas, in the classification of planting structure in HID, the SS-ELM algorithm had an excellent performance in classification accuracy and computational efficiency for three major planting crops including maize, wheat, and sunflowers. The estimated areas by using the SS-ELM algorithm based on the remote sensing images were consistent with the statistical data, and their difference was within a range of 3-25%. This implied that the SS-ELM framework could be served as an effective method for the classification of complex planting structures with relatively fast training, good generalization, universal approximation capability, and reasonable learning accuracy.

AB An overview shall be given on operational methods and steps involved, when optical remote sensing data shall be digitally processed to result in a land use data base, which certainly forms one of the most prominent tasks of remote sensing. Questions of terminology (especially land use and land cover) will be covered, as well as data selection and acquisition, noise correction, gee-coding, classification, post-processing and map production. Obviously, only guide-lines can be given and it would be ways beyond the scope of this article to cover the whole spectrum of interesting approaches. It must be pointed out, that high quality demands call for an adequate regard of ancillary data; their use is still hampered by technical barriers as disperse storage and solely analogue availability, various geometric projections, and others. Moreover, commercial image processing software for use with remote sensing data does hardly provide any tools to imbed a-priory knowledge. Gee-scientific knowledge on vegetation patterns, crop-rotation systems in agriculture and phenological information around the time of image acquisition ('dynamic vegetation models') can significantly improve the classification results. The core task is the design of an efficient classification method, which must be carefully adapted to the class specifications. A 'brute-force' approach aiming at results in a single step with one universal classifier cannot be recommended. Examples for a more sophisticated solution are basically taken from a large-area project for the state of Saxony (Germany): A combination of default functions and additional procedures was allowing to profit from a selective choice of spectral bands, classifiers and (post-)processing steps at every node of a hierarchical classification tree. Wherever local image features were performing insufficiently, textural or form attributes have been included. The cited project was accompanied by the generation of a set of 15 land-use maps in a standardised layout. Finally, some remarks will be given concerning a potential project for a comprehensive land-use map in a less-developed area like Albania.

AB Agricultural monitoring is a major concern to economies largely based on agriculture like Uruguay. In order to improve crop yield forecasts, identification of crop types must be performed early in the planting season. However, this task is generally difficult because of the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape, the different crop cycles, the spectral similarity with grassland, and the interannual variability due to climatic events and fallow periods. In collaboration with INIA, this study investigates remote sensing methods for dynamic mapping of cropland areas and for producing a map of winter and summer crops at 250m using MODIS time series. The originality of the approach consists of: (i) exploiting all the multi-spectral infonnation using an adaptive compositing method for a better discrimination of cropland types and to better capture their spatio-temporal variability; (ii) a spatio-temporal analysis of various land use types prior to the classification for a better knowledge of crops behaviours and the selection of the most discriminating seasons in the classification; and (iii) combining NDVI profiles, multi-spectral composites with reference dataset, high resolution images and expert knowledge. The accuracy of the product is assessed based on a reference dataset of crop fields. The results confirm the relevance of MODIS time series in term of spatial and temporal resolutions for mapping cropland areas and characterizing the inter-annual variability. Thanks to a good reference dataset and an analysis of crops spectro-temporal behaviour, it was possible to identify cropland areas from other land use types and discriminate summer crops from winter crops.

Recently, remote sensing data offers a comprehensive approach to achieve crop identification on a regional scale. However, the classification methods for multi-year mapping needs further study in regions with a complex planting structure, due to the mixed pixels at a spatial distribution and the high error in different years at a temporal scale. The objective of this study is to map the multi-year spatial distribution of three main crops (maize, sunflower, and wheat) in the Hetao irrigation district of China for the period 2012-2016 based on a pre-constrained classification method. The pre-constrained method integrates a parameterized phenology-based vegetation indexes classifier and two non-parametric machine learning algorithms-support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Results indicated that the performance of the pre-constrained classification method was excellent in the multi-year mapping of major crops in the study area, with absolute relative errors mainly less than 14% in the whole irrigation district and less than 20% in the five counties. The corresponding overall accuracy was 87.9%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.80. Mapping results showed that maize is mainly distributed in Hangjinhouqi, southern Linhe, northern Wuyuan, and eastern Wulateqianqi, while wheat is relatively less and scatteredly distributed in Hangjinhouqi and Wuyuan. Moreover, the sunflower planting area increased significantly and expanded spatially from Wuyuan and western Wulateqianqi to northern Hangjinhouqi and Linhe from 2012 to 2016. In addition, the phenology-based vegetation indexes classifier was found to be effective in improving the classification accuracy based on the contribution analysis.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing has the potential to provide quantitative information on the spatial cover, acquiring relevance for the agronomic management.. Traditionally, the diagnosis, management, and control of diseases in oil palm crops is a time-consuming and difficult task given that it needs a visual symptom observation. Currently, oil palm crops deal with diseases and infections. The bud rot disease (PC in Spanish) of the oil palm is one of the most common diseases in Central and South American countries, especially in Colombia. A viable alternative for the identification of diseased palms is the use of hyperspectral images and classification algorithms. Nevertheless, the usual assumption that every pixel of the hyperspectral image can be associated with a unique class label is no longer verified, and mixed pixels cannot be correctly addressed by traditional classifiers. This paper presents an unmixing-based approach as a tool for classification of stress oil palms caused by the bud rot disease, conducted on hyperspectral datasets of oil palm crops from Colombia, through the estimation of abundance maps with three labels: diseased oil palm, healthy oil palm and background (grass-shadow).

AB Proper crop identification is a difficult task in a particular area by using the survey method, and it is essential for planning and management of water resources. Types of crops may be dynamic in any area during a season, and it also depends on the cultivator. The current study is the identification of spatial crops in Rabi season using multi-temporal satellite imagery. Different types of crops have different reflectance in the electromagnetic spectrum. A single crop shows different reflectance in different time of the growing period. The region of interest for the analysis is a part of the Narmada River basin of Madhya Pradesh covering an area of about 20,558 km(2). Land use classification was carried out using LISS-III satellite imagery and demarcation of the agricultural lands of the study area was done. Multi-temporal AWiFS satellite data (9 images) were used for extracting the crop types from October 23, 2011 to March 10, 2012 and NDVI method was applied to the AWiFS satellite data. Different crops have shown different NDVI values during Rabi season. Wheat and soyabean were observed to be the major crops during Rabi season in the study area. Locations (sample points) of different crops were taken from the field survey at the same time period (Rabi). Fuzzy Supervised Classification (FSC) method was applied for identifying the major five crops using NDVI outputs. The results of the accuracy assessment give the overall accuracy and Kappa statistics about 85.60 % and 0.79 respectively.

AB Remote sensing has facilitated the identification of acreage and spatial distribution of field crops with obvious seasonal dynamics. The primary objective of this study is to identify the spatial patterns of double-season early rice, single-season middle rice and double-season late rice of Hunan Province and Yuanjiang City, China, in 2010, using two kinds of time series remotely sensed imagery: 8-day composite MODIS surface reflectance product data (MOD09A1) and HJ-1A/B satellite images with a 4-day revisit period. The available MODIS and HJ-1 CCD images of transplanting and heading stages were first assured in accordance with the schedules of local traditional paddy fields tillage. Based on the MOD09A1 data product, time series normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were calculated and smoothed to remove the noise and the atmospheric effects. Second, the spatial distribution and planting acreage of three types of rice of Hunan Province were derived from combining the enhanced vegetation index and land surface water index according to the water background and variation characteristics of NDVI values at transplanting and heading stages. Conversely, a two-test procedure was used to finish the identification of paddy rice in Yuanjiang City using time series HJ-CCD imagery. The first test was to derive the potential rice pixels using the NDVI image (a dagger NDVI) between heading and transplanting stages, and the second test was to remove the non-rice pixels using maximum likelihood supervised classification. The experimental results showed that three types of rice were mainly distributed along the Dongting Lake Basin in Hunan Province and the relative errors were -10.99, 1.46 and -5.87 %, respectively, while they were primarily planted in the northern plains of Dongting Lake in Yuanjiang City, where the relative errors were 12.1, 16.7 and 0.8 %, respectively. We conclude that transplanting and heading stages are the best phenological combinations for identifying paddy rice through remote sensing time series analysis, and this study can provide a basis for evaluating paddy rice yield on a large scale .

AB Crop classification for acreage assessment using optical satellite data is challenging during Kharif (rainy) season in India due to persistent cloud cover. Microwave SAR data provides a promising alternative to it. In this present study, an optimum combination of multi-date Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR data (VV mode) and RADARSAT-2 (R-2) fine quad polarization SAR (HH, VV, VH, and HV) data was used for crop classification at the field level, using machine learning techniques. Four dates of S-1 data, between July and August, and three dates R-2 quad pol data between September and October were used during the Kharif season of 2019 for part of Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The study area's principal crops are rice and soybean, while minor crops are maize, pigeon pea, etc. A comprehensive approach combining principal component analysis, separability analysis, and layer-layer correlation was used to select the best seven dates/layers dataset for crop classification. Supervised machine learning classification algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), random forest, spectral angle mapper, and maximum likelihood classification were performed on the best set of S-1 and R-2 SAR selected dataset. Additionally, Wishart unsupervised classification was also performed on R-2 fully polarimetric data to classify the crops based on their scattering behavior. The results from five classification techniques were compared for their accuracy using ground truth data. It was observed that SVM, followed by Wishart, performed better than all other classification techniques regarding crop classification and area estimation accuracy. Overall, the study showed that an optimal combination of multi-date and multi-polarization SAR data from different satellites with a suitable classification technique is useful for crop area estimation at the field level, during Kharif season.

AB Expert assessments for crop and range productivity of very-large arid and semi-arid areas worldwide are ever more in demand and these studies require greater sensitivity in delineating the different grades or levels of soil salinity. In conjunction with field study in arid southeastern Oregon, we assess the merit of adding decision-tree analysis (DTA) to a commonly used remote-sensing method. Randomly sampled surface soil horizons were analyzed for saturation percentage, field capacity, pH and electrical conductivity (EC). IFSAR data were acquired for terrain analysis and surficial geological mapping, followed by derivation of layers for analysis. Significant correlation was found between EC values and surface elevation, bands 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Landsat TM image, and brightness and wetness indices. Maximum-likelihood supervised classification of the Landsat images yields two salinity classes: non-saline soils (EC < 4 dSm(-1)), prediction accuracy of 97%, and saline soils (EC > 4 dSm(-1)), prediction accuracy 60%. Addition of DTA results in successful prediction of five classes of soil salinity and an overall accuracy of about 99%. Moreover, the calculated area of salt-affected soil was overestimated when mapped using remote sensing data only compared to that predicted by additionally using DTA. DTA is a promising approach for mapping soil salinity in more productive and accurate ways compared to only using remote-sensing analysis.

AB This paper presents a new approach for refining and selecting training data for satellite imagery-based crop discrimination. The goal of this approach is to automate the pixel-based "multievidence crop classification approach," proposed by the authors in their previous research. The present study is used to feed this classification approach with automatically selected training samples based on available vector data (agricultural parcels representing crop boundaries with crop codes). The vector data are created by farmers to support subsidy claims and are, therefore, prone to errors such as boundary digitization mismatch and mislabeling of crop codes. The proposed approach, ensemble-based cluster refinement approach (ECRA), refines the declared crop clusters in an iterative training-classification scheme and provides potential training samples that give correct class descriptions. ECRA operates based on two assumptions: 1) mislabels in each class will be far from their cluster centroid and 2) each crop class based on the available vector data has more correctly labeled samples than mislabeled samples. Three datasets, derived from bitemporal WorldView-2 multispectral imagery, are used in an ensemble framework to iteratively refine the samples from crop clusters declared by the farmers: spectral, texture, and vegetation indices. Once the refinement of clusters is complete, final training samples are identified. They are used for learning and the satellite imagery is classified using the multievidence classification approach. The study is implemented with WorldView-2 imagery acquired for a study area in Denmark containing 15 crop classes. The multievidence classification approach with ECRA-based refinement is compared with the classification based on common training sample selection methods (manual and random). It is also compared with the winner-takes-all-based classification approach. ECRA achieves an overall classification accuracy of 92.8%, which is higher than existing common approaches.

AB Being an important economic crop that contributes 35% of the total consumption of vegetable oil, remote sensing-based quantitative detection of oil palm trees has long been a key research direction for both agriculture and environmental purposes. While existing methods already demonstrate satisfactory effectiveness for small regions, performing the detection for a large region with satisfactory accuracy is still challenging. In this study, we proposed a two-stage convolutional neural network (TS-CNN)-based oil palm detection method using high-resolution satellite images (i.e. Quickbird) in a large-scale study area of Malaysia. The TS-CNN consists of one CNN for land cover classification and one CNN for object classification. The two CNNs were trained and optimized independently based on 20,000 samples collected through human interpretation. For the large-scale oil palm detection for an area of 55 km(2), we proposed an effective workflow that consists of an overlapping partitioning method for large-scale image division, a multi-scale sliding window method for oil palm coordinate prediction, and a minimum distance filter method for post-processing. Our proposed approach achieves a much higher average F1-score of 94.99% in our study area compared with existing oil palm detection methods (87.95%, 81.80%, 80.61%, and 78.35% for single-stage CNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), respectively), and much fewer confusions with other vegetation and buildings in the whole image detection results.

AB The use of remote sensing images (RSIs) as a source of information in agribusiness applications is very common. In those applications, it is fundamental to identify and understand trends and patterns in space occupation. However, the identification and recognition of crop regions in remote sensing images are not trivial tasks yet. In high-resolution image analysis and recognition, many of the problems are related to the representation scale of the data, and to both the size and the representativeness of the training set. In this paper, we propose a method for interactive classification of remote sensing images considering multiscale segmentation. Our aim is to improve the selection of training samples using the features from the most appropriate scales of representation. We use a boosting-based active learning strategy to select regions at various scales for user's relevance feedback. The idea is to select the regions that are closer to the border that separates both target classes: relevant and non-relevant regions. Experimental results showed that the combination of scales produces better results than isolated scales in a relevance feedback process. Furthermore, the interactive method achieved good results with few user interactions. The proposed method needs only a small portion of the training set to build classifiers that are as strong as the ones generated by a supervised method that uses the whole training set.

AB With increasing consumption, plastic mulch benefits agriculture by promoting crop quality and yield, but the environmental and soil pollution is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, research on the monitoring of plastic mulched farmland (PMF) has received increasing attention. Plastic mulched farmland in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote images due to the high resolution, shows a prominent spatial pattern, which brings difficulties to the task of monitoring PMF. In this paper, through a comparison between two deep semantic segmentation methods, SegNet and fully convolutional networks (FCN), and a traditional classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method aimed at accurately recognizing PMF for UAV remote sensing images from Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. After experiments with single-band, three-band and six-band image data, we found that deep semantic segmentation models built via single-band data which only use the texture pattern of PMF can identify it well; for example, SegNet reaching the highest accuracy of 88.68% in a 900 nm band. Furthermore, with three visual bands and six-band data (3 visible bands and 3 near-infrared bands), deep semantic segmentation models combining the texture and spectral features further improve the accuracy of PMF identification, whereas six-band data obtains an optimal performance for FCN and SegNet. In addition, deep semantic segmentation methods, FCN and SegNet, due to their strong feature extraction capability and direct pixel classification, clearly outperform the traditional SVM method in precision and speed. Among three classification methods, SegNet model built on three-band and six-band data obtains the optimal average accuracy of 89.62% and 90.6%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed deep semantic segmentation model, when tested against the traditional classification method, provides a promising path for mapping PMF in UAV remote sensing images.

AB Time series of remote sensing EVI/MODIS data are an important source of information to evaluate the direct land conversion to sugarcane in response to increased ethanol production in Brazil. The present work uses a time series of EVI/MODIS data to identify the land use prior to the conversion to sugarcane in a dense cultivated region in Parana State, Brazil. Some sugarcane fields were selected over MODIS images acquired during the period of 2000 to 2008 in order to obtain reference time series to perform the land use classification prior to 2005. Using the temporal behavior of the EVI curves it was possible to distinguish among pasture land, annual crops and sugarcane in order to identify the land use prior to sugarcane conversion. It was noticed that in 2000 several of the annual crop fields in 2005, were pasture land in 2000 which were gradually converted to annual crops until 2005 and then to sugarcane.

AB Using remote sensing and UAVs in smart farming is gaining momentum worldwide. The main objectives are crop and weed detection, biomass evaluation and yield prediction. Evaluating machine learning methods for remote sensing based yield prediction requires availability of yield mapping devices, which are still not very common among farmers. In this study Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - a deep learning methodology showing outstanding performance in image classification tasks - are applied to build a model for crop yield prediction based on NDVI and RGB data acquired from UAVs. The effect of various aspects of the CNN such as selection of the training algorithm, depth of the network, regularization strategy, and tuning of the hyperparameters on the prediction efficiency are tested. Using the Adadelta training algorithm, L-2 regularization with early stopping and a CNN with 6 convolutional layers, mean absolute error (MAE) in yield prediction of 484.3 kg/ha and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.8% was achieved for data acquired during the early period of the growth season (i.e., in June of 2017, growth phase < 25%) with RGB data. When using data acquired later in July and August of 2017 (growth phase > 25%), MAE of 624.3 kg/ha (MAPE: 12.6%) was obtained. Significantly, the CNN architecture performed better with RGB data than the NDVI data.

AB Crop cover and crop rotation mapping is an important and still evolving field in remote sensing science for which robust and highly automated processing chains are required. This study presents an improved mapping procedure for crop rotations of irrigated areas in Central Asia by using classification and regression trees (CARTs) applied to transformations of 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. The time series were divided into several temporal segments, from which metrics were derived as input features for classification. This temporal aggregation was applied to suppress within-class temporal variability. Various lengths of temporal segments were tested for their potential to increase classification accuracy. In addition, tests of enhancing the classification accuracy were done by combining different classification results using the majority rule for voting. These different processing strategies were applied to four annual time series (2004-2007) of the Khorezm region, where 270 000 ha of irrigated land is dominated by rotations of cotton, wheat and rice. Improved classification results were obtained for CARTs applied to metrics derived from a mixture of different segment lengths. The sole use of either long or short temporal segments was inferior. CART prioritized segments representing active phases of the phenological development. The best result, the optimized segment-based approach, achieved an overall accuracy between 83 and 85% for classifications between 2004 and 2007; in particular, the small range demonstrated the robustness regarding inter-annual variations. These accuracies exceeded those of the original time series without temporal segmentation by 6-7%. With some adjustments to other crops and field heterogeneity influencing the usefulness of a respective sensor, the approach can be applied to other irrigation systems in Central Asia.

AB ENVISAT AATSR data over the Indian subcontinent have been procured from ESA and preprocessed with DESCW and BEAM 2.2 software for extraction of our area of interest. Two intensive test sites have been chosen, including a part of the Himalayan region and the Sundarban Delta. Calibration of AATSR thermal IR data for surface temperature modelling has been attempted over the Sundarban Delta region. Later, the surface temperature maps have been utilized to generate the momentary and daily evapotranspiration patterns over the area of interest which have been further used for broad land use/crop classifications. A simplified model suggested by Soer [Estimation of regional evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions using remotely sensed crop surface temperatures, Remote Sensing of Environment 9 (1980) 27-45] has been used to estimate evapotranspiration over the area of interest. The results match with the earlier observation in this region. Further processing of AATSR data has been performed over the Himalayan region to extract two minor faults across the main thrust belts.

AB Crop planting area mapping and phenology monitoring are of great importance to analyzing the impacts of climate change on agricultural production. In this study, crop planting area and phenology were identified based on Sentinel-1 backscatter time series in the test region of the North China Plain, East Asia, which has a stable cropping pattern and similar phenological stages across the region. Ground phenological observations acquired from a typical agro-meteorological station were used as a priori knowledge. A parallelepiped classifier processed VH (vertical transmitting, horizontal receiving) and VV (vertical transmitting, vertical receiving) backscatter signals in order to map the winter wheat planting area. An accuracy assessment showed that the total classification accuracy reached 84% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.77. Both the difference (sigma d) between VH and VV and its slope were obtained to contrast with a priori knowledge and then used to extract the phenological metrics. Our findings from the analysis of the time series showed that the seedling, tillering, overwintering, jointing, and heading of winter wheat may be closely related to sigma d and its slope. Overall, this study presents a generalizable methodology for mapping the winter wheat planting area and monitoring phenology using Sentinel-1 backscatter time series, especially in areas lacking optical remote sensing data. Our results suggest that the main change in Sentinel-1 backscatter is dominated by the vegetation canopy structure, which is different from the established methods using optical remote sensing data, and it is available for phenological metrics extraction.

ID REMOTELY SENSED DATA; LAND-USE; SIR-A
AB Remote sensing of land cover in Mediterranean regions is complicated by the high landscape diversity, which is typical of both natural and agricultural lands. This spatial complexity reduces the accuracy of the common per-pixel classification of multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. In this paper we show that per-field statistics derived from multi-spectral imagery enhances separability between different crops and terrain categories. We also found that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery processed with Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery in a synergistic context produces a higher enhancement of discrimination if per-field statistics are used. Finally, we show that image segmentation is a convenient way to apply this approach avoiding field digitizing by computing per-segment statistics of training fields and classifying the segmented image through Linear Canonical Discriminant Analysis.

AB Information about rice phase growth is essential forpredicting of rice production, and to ensure food security program, especially during Rendeng season of rice field. The use of remote sensing data is very helpful in the process of determining the phases of plant growth. Information about the condition of the rice plant is very important to be able to estimate the growth phases and the planting season that fittingwithin the control of the production results of the rice field. This research aims to analyze phenology of rice crops during Rendeng season using remote sensing data by utilizing EVI-2 ratio. The methods used in this research is a descriptive method of quantitative interpretation with Landsat 8 OLI data.Classification on phenology phase was carried out fro the selected area of Aceh Besar District, Aceh. Results show that phenology cycle of rice crop during Rendengseason vary, ranging from low greenness to high greenness. The total area for each phase of growth also varies, with peak area occur inJanuary.There are cyclical differences of different rice plant phenology in the Rendeng in Aceh Besar District. The differences of planting times by the farmers resulted in the existence of the value of the EVI-2 ratio variation in the area. January is the higher values of the greenness of rice crop then drop to February to March. The value of the ratio of EVI-2 experience increases with the total area of rice plant in accordance with the phases of growth of the rice plant.

AB The analysis of remote sensing images represents a highly important issue to be performed in many relevant fields such as climate change studies or land cover mapping. Traditional proposals usually identify the land cover classes from general related groups such as different tree species or different crop varieties. Additionally, these proposals commonly use information from a precise time span or season, not accounting for the variability of the data over the entire year, specially in regions with several seasons.
   In this work, we propose a multi-temporal classification system to identify and represent diverse land cover classes over any period of the entire year by using Sentinel-2 satellite image data. To this end, 526 representative samples were labelled from 5 complex and variable different land cover types over the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Betanzos Mandeo in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The method achieves a satisfactory mean accuracy value of 84.0% for the testing set using the best configuration with a radial Support Vector Machine classifier. This system will be used in the study of the population connectivity of two threatened herptiles, but it can be easily extended to other species of interest in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB For evaluating the progresses towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global indicator framework was developed by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals Indicators. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology and a set of workflows for calculating SDGs indicators. The main improvements consist of using moderate and high spatial resolution satellite data and state-of-the-art deep learning methodology for land cover classification and for assessing land productivity. Within the European Network for Observing our Changing Planet (ERA-PLANET), three SDGs indicators are calculated. In this research, harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data are analyzed and used for land productivity analysis and yield assessment, as well as Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series are utilized for crop mapping. We calculate for the whole territory of Ukraine SDG indicators: 15.1.1 - 'Forest area as proportion of total land area'; 15.3.1 - 'Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area'; and 2.4.1 - 'Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture'. Workflows for calculating these indicators were implemented in a Virtual Laboratory Platform. We conclude that newly available high-resolution remote sensing products can significantly improve our capacity to assess several SDGs indicators through dedicated workflows.

AB The remote sensing (RS) imagery is important to the development of the spectral signature of mango orchards, vegetation, and other land-use features, and to geospatial feature extraction using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The geospatial information is useful for monitoring vegetation growth, urban development, and land-use / land-cover (LU/LC) change detection. The objective of this study to develop a spectral signature and feature extraction of land-use classes using the multi-temporal and multi-spectral (MTMS) Landsat imagery dataset. The imagery dataset has obtained three images from various sensors of the Landsat satellite system from the years 2003 to 2017. The pre-processing of the imagery is crucial for geospatial feature extraction and analysis of land-use features. The vegetation index (VI) is used in this study to monitor the health and growth of orchards, vegetation, and crop. The resulting accuracy of classification using ANNs method for different years (2017, 2010, and 2003) are 90.10%, 75.75%, and 78.37%. The results of the presented study indicated that significant changes have occurred in the study region, which has affected the environment and human activities. The information of LU/LC's situation in the region will help the urban planners and decision-makers to plan for effectively managing future LU/LC change.

AB Accurate information on the extent and characteristics of rainfed rice-growing environments is lacking because of the high degree of temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem/subecosystem-differentiating parameters. Although the repeated classification and mapping capture the temporal variability, the information generated reflects post facto conditions and the same geographical area gets classified under different ecozones over years; hence, the delineated ecosystems/subecosystems seem to be transitional. This limits the utility of such an enormous effort. To overcome these problems, this study developed a remote sensing and GIS-based methodology which captures the temporal variability as well as spatial heterogeneity of the ecozone-differentiating parameters and their effect on vegetation (crop) conditions, and prepared criteria for accurate delineation and characterization of rainfed rice ecosystems/subecosystems. The results showed vegetation condition to be a comprehensive reflection of the crop-growing situations and the vegetation index as an excellent criterion for ecosystem/ subecosystem classification when combined with the existing classification criteria. These methods have been successfully applied in pilot areas and show greater promise for applicability in similar situations, as well as in other environments with some modifications.

AB Expansion of large-scale tree plantations for commodity crop and timber production is a leading cause of tropical deforestation. While automated detection of plantations across large spatial scales and with high temporal resolution is critical to inform policies to reduce deforestation, such mapping is technically challenging. Thus, most available plantation maps rely on visual inspection of imagery, and many of them are limited to small areas for specific years. Here, we present an automated approach, which we call Plantation Analysis by Learning from Multiple Classes (PALM), for mapping plantations on an annual basis using satellite remote sensing data. Due to the heterogeneity of land cover classes, PALM utilizes ensemble learning to simultaneously incorporate training samples from multiple land cover classes over different years. After the ensemble learning, we further improve the performance by post-processing using a Hidden Markov Model. We implement the proposed automated approach using MODIS data in Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan). To validate the classification, we compare plantations detected using our approach with existing datasets developed through visual interpretation. Based on random sampling and comparison with high-resolution images, the user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of our generated map are around 85% and 80% in our study region.

AB Spring crops are a monoculture in Northern Kazakhstan. Mid-resolution satellite data of red and near infrared spectral bands from the Russian satellite, Resource MSU-SK and Terra's MODIS satellite can be used for assessment of regional landuse and land cover. The objective of this research is to improve the classification of spring crops, range and fallow land from mid-resolution satellites. The study was conducted for the Akmola Oblast for the 2000 and 2001 vegetation season. Three specific phenological periods were selected to maximize the spectral differences between landuse types. Images were acquired for clear sky conditions and composites developed for each for the three periods. Training sites were identified and supervised classification performed from the multi-temporal composite. Classification accuracy was assessed based on farmer interviews for information on landuse for more then 800 agricultural fields. The classification error analyses suggested 13% for spring wheat, 14% for fallows, 20% for multiyear grasses classes. The errors in classification are attributed primarily to the unusual spectral characteristics of certain agricultural fields and the lack of cloud free imagery during the critical phenological periods.

AB Advancements in hyperspectral remote sensing technology have opened new avenues to explore innovative ways to map crops in terms of area and health. To study precise mapping of agriculture and horticulture crops along with biophysical and biochemical constituents at field scale, an airborne AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imaging has been conducted in various agro-climatic regions representing diverse agricultural types of India. Crop classification with available and developed algorithms has been applied over homogeneous and heterogeneous agriculture and horticulture cropped areas. The spectral angle mapper and maximum likelihood algorithms showed classification accuracy of 77%-94% for AVIRI-NG and 42%-55% for LISS IV. The customized deep neural network and maximum noise function (MNF)-based classification schemes showed an accuracy of 93% and 86% for mapping of agriculture and horticulture crops respectively. The forward and inversion of canopy radiative transfer model protocol was developed for retrieval of crop parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (C-ab) using AVIRIS-NG narrow bands. The retrieved LAI and C-ab showed 19%-27% and 23%-29% deviation from measured mean for homogeneous and heterogeneous agricultural areas respectively. Red edge position index-based empirical model and multivariate linear regression of multiple indices showed maximum correlation of 0.62 and 0.93 respectively, to map leaf nitrogen content. Water condition index was developed using vegetation and water indices to distinguish crop water-based abiotic stress. Wheat yellow rust disease has been identified at field scale using absorption band depth analysis at 662-702 and 2155-2175 nm, and further applied to AVIRIS-NG data to detect biotic stress at spatial scale. This study establishes that such missions have the potential to boost accurate mapping of economically valuable minor crops and generate health indicators to distinguish biotic and abiotic stresses at field scale.

AB Identification and classification of crops cultivated areas using satellite images is important for making different types of analysis to formulate policies and plan in agricultural and environmental domains. A range of Feature Extraction Techniques (such as Statistical, Texture, DWT and DCT), having a vital role in crop classification, have been employed and analyzed to suggest the best one for classifying crop images from regions of Netherlands and Pakistan. These feature extraction techniques have been evaluated with number of classification techniques like Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and ensemble based classifiers. A rigorous analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques over variety of feature sets in the regions under study. Data set containing satellite images from cultivated lands of Netherlands and Pakistan have been used for experimentation. DWT and DCT have shown better precision and accuracy in classifying the crop images from Netherlands and Pakistan respectively, compared to rest of the feature extraction techniques.

AB The loess plateau in China has faced severe soil erosion and runoff. Check-dams are effective measures for soil and water conservation; concomitantly check-dam planning and construction urgently require current land use maps. Remote sensing technique plays a key role in achieving up-to-date land use maps. However, limited by the impact of hilly and gully terrain in the loess plateau, commonly used classifier for remote sensing data cannot achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, HongShiMao watershed in the loess plateau was chosen as the study area. Decision tree classifier (DTC) based on a genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to the land use classification automatically. Compared with the results by iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA), GA-based DTC had much better results. Its total accuracy was 83.2% with a Kappa coefficient 0.807. The results also showed that most part of the study area belonged to the barren land with sparse grass or crop cover that attributed to the soil erosion and runoff.

AB As the core issues of agricultural remote sensing, the mapping of crop planting and dynamic monitoring of crop growth in the urban area have always been limited by complex climatic conditions that induced optical image shortages. Considering that the backscattering signals of SAR image data are sensitive to crop phenological period, the paper presents a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) model to realize the wide-area planting thematic mapping at the pixel level. Taking Fujin City of Heilongjiang province in China as a specific study area, we selected rice as the typical research object and obtained urban-scale rice planting thematic mapping using Sentinel-1A image data derived from April to October 2020. Based on the proposed FCN classification method, the rice extraction precision is up to 95.7%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.90. Comparative analysis indicated that the proposed model is superior to the traditional random forest classification model in extraction precision and kappa coefficient. Further analysis showed that the rice growth cycle in Fujin City was consistent with the time series of VH/VV polarization coefficient ratio and had prominent phenological cycle characteristics. Relevant research data and results proved that high-precision planting thematic mapping at an urban scale could be achieved based on time series SAR image data sets. And the proposed FCN classification model is helping to dynamic monitoring of crop growth and related phenological research.

AB This study focuses on the generation of reliable data for improving land and water use in Central Asia. An object-based remote sensing classification is applied and combined with the CropWat model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to determine crop distribution and water requirements for irrigation of cotton and winter-wheat in Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. The crop classification is conducted on RapidEye and Landsat data acquired before the onset of the main summer irrigation phases in July using a random forest algorithm. The ClimWat database of FAO is utilized for calculating crop water requirements (CWR) and crop irrigation requirements (CIR).
   Classification reveals an overall accuracy of 86.2% and exceeds a producer's (user's) accuracy of 95% (89%) for both, cotton and wheat. In 2010, cotton and winter-wheat are planted on 66.7% of the agricultural area under investigation, whereas orchard areas amount to 15.5%. The CWR modelled for winter-wheat and cotton cultivation revealed 5443 m(3) ha(-1) and 9278 m(3) ha(-1), respectively. Subtracting effective precipitation leads to OR of 4133 m(3) ha(-1) and 8813 m(3) ha(-1). Comparisons of CWR and CIR for the area dominating crops with the total of water officially allocated for irrigation underline the pressure on the water resources in the entire Syr Darya catchment and suggest modifications of the cropping system towards more winter crops. The early season crop maps can be used for water saving as they enable modifications of water allocation plans within the different irrigation subsystems of the valley. The method for mapping spatially distributed CWR and CIR can be transferred to other irrigated areas in Central Asia and beyond. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The delineation of management zones is an important step to implementing site-specific crop management practices. Remote sensing is a cost-effective way to acquire information needed for delineating management zones, since it has been successfully used for mapping soil properties and monitoring crop growth conditions. Remotely sensed hyperspectral data are particularly effective in deriving crop biophysical parameters in agricultural fields; therefore, the potential of hyperspectral data to contribute to management zone delineation needs to be assessed. In this study, the spatial variability of soil and crops in two agricultural fields was studied using seasonal compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) hyperspectral images. Different spectral features including soil brightness and colouration indices, principal components of soil reflectance data, and crop descriptors (leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content) were derived from CASI data and used to partition the fields into homogeneous zones using the fuzzy k means unsupervised classification method. The reduction of variances of soil electrical conductivity, LAI, leaf chlorophyll content, and yield was inspected to determine the appropriate number of zones for each field. The zones obtained were interpreted according to the soil survey map and field practices. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the delineation. The study shows that the spatial patterns of the resulting soil zones faithfully represent the soil classes described by the soil survey maps, and the spatial patterns of the resulting crop classes discriminated the different crop growth conditions well. These results show that hyperspectral data provide important information on field variability for management zone delineation in precision agriculture.

AB Crop lodging - the bending of crop stems from their upright position or the failure of root-soil anchorage systems - is a major yield-reducing factor in wheat and causes deterioration of grain quality. The severity of lodging can be measured by a lodging score (LS)- an index calculated from the crop angle of inclination (CAI) and crop lodged area (LA). LS is difficult and time consuming to measure manually meaning that information on lodging occurrence and severity is limited and sparse. Remote sensing-based estimates of LS can provide more timely, synoptic and reliable information on crop lodging across vast areas. This information could improve estimates of crop yield losses, inform insurance loss adjusters and influence management decisions for subsequent seasons.
   This research - conducted in the 600 ha wheat sown area in the Bonifiche Ferraresi farm, located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy - evaluated the performance of RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 data to discriminate and classify lodging severity based on field measured LS. We measured temporal crop status characteristics related to lodging (e.g. lodged area, CAI, crop height) and collected relevant meteorological data (wind speed and rainfall) throughout May-June 2018. These field measurements were used to distinguish healthy (He) wheat from lodged wheat with different degrees of lodging severity (moderate, severe and very severe). We acquired multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27 degrees and FQ21-41 degrees) RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 (40 degrees) images and derived multiple metrics from them to discriminate and classify lodging severity. As a part of our data exploration, we performed a correlation analysis between the image-based metrics and LS. Next, a multi-temporal discriminant analysis approach, including a partial least squares (PLS-DA) method, was developed to classify lodging severities. We used the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) and confusion matrices to evaluate the accuracy of the PLS-DA classification models.
   Results show that (1) volume scattering components were highly correlated with LS at low incidence angles while double and surface scattering was more prevalent at high incidence angles; (2) lodging severity was best classified using low incidence angle R-FQ8 data (overall accuracy 72%) and (3) the Sentinel-1 data-based classification model was able to correctly identify 60% of the lodging severity cases in the study site. The results from this first study on classifying lodging severity using satellite-based SAR platforms suggests that SAR-based metrics can capture a substantial proportion of the observed variation in lodging severity, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging assessment in particular, and sustainable agriculture in general.

AB In areas with complex three-dimensional features, slope and aspect interact with light conditions and significantly affect the spatial structure of images acquired by remote sensing instruments (for example, by changing the distribution of shadows and affecting the texture of high resolution imagery). In this scenario, this paper analyses the potential and the effectiveness of an automatic classification system to identify three fundamental vegetation classes (forest, grassland and crops) in the complex topography of the Italian Alps (Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy). This classification system is based on the fusion of spectral information provided by the SPOT-5 multi-spectral channels (Ground Instantaneous Field of View, GIFOV, equal to 10m) and textural information extracted from airborne digital orthophotos (GIFOV equal to 1m) and is designed to be user-friendly. The texture of the digital orthophotos was modelled using defined bidirectional variograms, thereby extracting additional information unavailable in first-order texture analyses. Using SPOT-5 multi-spectral information alone, the classification accuracy in the investigated alpine area was equal to 87.5%, but increased to 92.1% when texture information was included. In particular, the texture information significantly increased the classification accuracy for crops (from 68.9% to 87.9%), especially orchards that tend to be classified as lowland deciduous forests, and herbaceous crops (such as maize) that are often misclassified as grasslands. A further simple majority analysis increased the ability of detecting grassland, crops and urban zones. The combination of the majority analysis and the proposed automatic classification system seems an effective approach to classifying vegetation types in highly fragmented and complex Alpine landscapes on a regional scale.

AB High resolution satellite imagery offers new opportunities for crop monitoring and assessment. A SPOT 5 image acquired in May 2006 with four spectral bands (green, red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared) and 10-m pixel size covering intensively cropped areas in south Texas was evaluated for crop identification. Two images with pixel sizes of 20 m and 30 m were also generated from the original image to simulate coarser resolution satellite imagery. Two subset images covering a variety of crops with different growth stages were extracted from the satellite image and five supervised classification techniques, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, spectral angle mapper (SAM), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to the 10-m subset images and the two coarser resolution images to identify crop types. The effects of the short-wave infrared band and pixel size on classification results were also examined. Kappa analysis showed that maximum likelihood and SVM performed better than the other three classifiers, though there were no statistical differences between the two best classifiers. Accuracy assessment showed that the 10-m, four-band images based on maximum likelihood resulted in the best overall accuracy values of 91% and 87% for the two respective sites. The inclusion of the short-wave infrared band statistically significantly increased the overall accuracy from 82% to 91% for site 1 and from 75% to 87% for site 2. The increase in pixel size from 10 m to 20 m or 30 m did not significantly affect the classification accuracy for crop identification. These results indicate that SPOT 5 multispectral imagery in conjunction with maximum likelihood and SVM classification techniques can be used for identifying crop types and estimating crop areas.

AB Remote sensing image classification is difficult, especially for agricultural crops with identical phenological growth periods. In this context, multi-sensor image fusion allows a comprehensive representation of biophysical and structural information. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods are used for several applications due to their spatial-spectral interpretability. Hence, this study explores the potential of fused multi-temporal Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) images for Land Use/Land Cover classification over an agricultural area in India. For classification, Bayesian optimised 2D CNN-based DL and pixel-based SVM classifiers were used. For fusion, a CNN-based siamese network with Ratio-of-Laplacian pyramid method was used for the images acquired over the entire winter cropping period. This fusion strategy leads to better interpretability of results and also found that 2D CNN-based DL classifier performed well in terms of classification accuracy for both single-month (95.14% and 96.11%) as well as multi-temporal (99.87% and 99.91%) fusion in comparison to the SVM with classification accuracy for single-month (80.02% and 81.36%) and multi-temporal fusion (95.69% and 95.84%). Results indicate better performance by Vertical-Vertical polarised fused images than Vertical-Horizontal polarised fused images. Thus, implying the need to analyse classified images obtained by DL classifiers along with the classification accuracy.

AB By using 3s technology, the dynamic crop information system can be developed to meet the needs of sharing the agriculture information in Shaanxi Province. The dynamic crop information system can realize the query of crop information attribute and space, and the automatic acquirement, dynamic distribution and classification analysis of crop information. In this way, the whole process of real-time management of agricultural product with information and visualization can be carried out, which is to improve the level of agriculture information management automation in Shaanxi Province.
   The main agricultural products in Shaanxi Province consist of two categories, the food crops and the economic crops. The former includes wheat, corn, rice, potato and soybean etc., and the latter includes rape, apple, and pear and so on. Crop production plays an important role in the traditional agriculture in Shaanxi Province. The price of agricultural products has witnessed great fluctuations these days. On the one hand, the price of agricultural products in urban area is very high. On the other hand, the agricultural product is unsalable in some places, which brings great financial losses to those farmers. How to efficiently make use of the land resources, how to ensure the price of agricultural products, how to stabilize the agricultural product, and how to improve comprehensive production capacity, anti-risk ability and the market competition ability of the agricultural product are the urgent problems to be solved. This study adopts the method of combining the GPS, RS and GIS to extract and classify the earth surface information, by which the crop information system can be established. This system can offer the basis for management and masses of users to realize the automatic extraction of agricultural cultivation information. At present, remote sensing technology has been widely used in agriculture, forestry, geology, ocean, meteorology, hydrology, military, environmental protection and many other fields. In terms of agricultural production, remote sensing technology can provide objective, timely and accurate information with great variety of crop ecological environment and crop growth. It is the important source to obtain the field data for precision agriculture

AB Remote sensing imagery is currently used as an efficient tool for agricultural management. Particularly, very high spatial resolution (less than 1m) enables extraction of permanent crops (including nut orchards) by visual interpretation or automated methods based on mainly textural features representing the regular plantation pattern. For accurate detection of orchards (hazelnuts in particular), this study proposes a rule-based classification utilizing multi-scale Gabor features and spectral values. Thanks to its very high spatial (0.5m) and spectral (8-bands) resolution, WorldView-2 imagery is primarily used. The classification accuracies, obtained with features extracted from WorldView-2 and Quickbird imagery, are compared for a study area in Turkey (major hazelnut producer in the world). In addition, supplementary value of the new 4 bands (coastal, yellow, red edge, and NIR2) in WorldView-2 imagery is discussed.

AB Crop residue management is an important conservation practice that can preserve soil and water resources. Monitoring how farmers manage their land in terms of tillage practices can provide insights on the effectiveness of the conservation programs so that we can improve the implementation of conservation tillage practices to optimize crop yields and environmental conservation. Remote sensing is a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for tillage monitoring. Previous studies have established the minimum Normalized Difference Tillage Index (minNDTI) technique at a pixel level for tillage mapping by extracting the minimum values from time-series Landsat NDTI spectral profiles. The objective of this study was to evaluate the minNDTI technique and to devise strategies for mapping tillage practices at the field level. We incorporated a multiscale image segmentation approach to fill Landsat 7 scan line corrector (SLC)-off data gaps to facilitate site-specific and broad-scale mapping of tillage practices. The gap-filled Landsat 7 images were combined with Landsat 5 imagery to develop a multitemporal image series for tillage mapping. We then applied object-based approaches and utilized the USDA cropland data layer to produce field-level tillage maps, which were evaluated using field observations and Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC) county-level tillage data. Our results show that the gap-filling procedure is effective for the purpose of tillage mapping. Overall classification accuracies of tillage maps range from 69 to 79%. Comparison between remotely sensed and CTIC tillage data suggests that we can monitor tillage practices systematically using remote sensing imagery.

AB Crop mapping through classification of Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) data can provide very valuable information for several agricultural applications, such as crop monitoring, yield estimation, and crop inventory. However, the SITS data classification is not straightforward. Because different images of a SITS data have different levels of information regarding the classification problems. Moreover, the SITS data is a four-dimensional data that cannot be classified using the conventional classification algorithms. To address these issues in this paper, we presented a classification strategy based on Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithms for SITS data classification. In this strategy, initially different kernels are constructed from different images of the SITS data and then they are combined into a composite kernel using the MKL algorithms. The composite kernel, once constructed, can be used for the classification of the data using the kernel-based classification algorithms. We compared the computational time and the classification performances of the proposed classification strategy using different MKL algorithms for the purpose of crop mapping. The considered MKL algorithms are: MKL-Sum, SimpleMKL, LPMKL and Group-Lasso MKL algorithms. The experimental tests of the proposed strategy on two SITS data sets, acquired by SPOT satellite sensors, showed that this strategy was able to provide better performances when compared to the standard classification algorithm. The results also showed that the optimization method of the used MKL algorithms affects both the computational time and classification accuracy of this strategy.

AB Determination and classification of plant patterns with satellite images is most suitable method for preparation of source inventory. The use of high resolution satellite imagery is quite widespread for separation of land use types. Pixel based classification methods are widely used to classify images. The choice of classification methods in satellite images directly affects the success of the research. In recent years, the use of object-based classification method to determine the plant pattern as parcels is being investigated. In this study, we present an example to determine the crop pattern as parcels using pixel and object based classification methods.
   The study was conducted in Isparta-Turkey. Quickbird-2 satellite image, ERDAS and e-Cognition Developer Trial 8.8 software were used. Maximum likelihood and Isodata algorithms of Pixel-based classification methods and, multiresolution segmentation operator of object-based classification methods were used to classify satellite imagery. Object-based classification method was determined to be more successful than pixel-based classification method, based our analyses.

AB Agricultural landscapes are characterized by diversity and complexity, which makes crop mapping at a regional scale a top priority for different purposes such as administrative decisions and farming management. Project 32194 of the Dragon 4 Program was implemented to meet the requirements of crop mapping, with the specific objective to develop suitable approaches for precise crop mapping with combined uses of European and Chinese high- and medium-resolution satellite images. Two sub-projects were involved in the project. The first was to focus on the use of time series high-resolution satellite data, including Sentinel-2 (S2, European satellite data) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1, Chinese satellite data), due to their similar spectral bands for Earth observation, while the second was to focus on medium-resolution data sources, i.e., the European Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) and Chinese Fengyun-3 Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (FY-3 MERSI) satellite data, also due to their similar spectral channels. The approach of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sent2Agri project for crop mapping was adapted in the first sub-project and applied to the Yellow River irrigated district (YERID) of Ningxia in northwest China in order to assess its ability to accurately identify crop types in China. The goal of the second sub-project was to explore the potential of both European and Chinese medium-resolution satellite data for crop assessment in a large area. Methods to handle the data and retrieve the required information for the precise crop mapping were developed in the study, including the adaptation of the ESA approach to GF-1 data and the application of algorithms for classification. A scheme for the validation of the crop mapping was developed in the study. The results of implementing the scheme to the YERID in Ningxia indicated that the overall accuracies of crop mapping with S2 and GF-1 can be high, up to 94-97%, and the mapping had an accuracy of 88% with the PROBA-V and FY3B-MERSI data. The very high accuracy suggests the possibility of precise crop mapping with the combined use of time series high- and medium-resolution satellite data when suitable approaches are chosen to handle the data for the classification of crop types.

AB Agriculture plays an important role in the global economy, and sustainability of this sector is critical for world food security. Annual information on agricultural land use (crop inventory) would permit efficient and effective delivery of agricultural programs that support sustainability of this resource Previous research has revealed encouraging results on using space borne satellite data (Landsat, SPOT) for crop mapping at the regional scale. Given Canada's large land mass, for operational crop monitoring satellite data with a wide swath and moderate spatial resolution are needed This study presents the results on integrating RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR data with AWIFS data to improve crop identification. This study demonstrates that multi-temporal AWIFS data can produce an adequate crop classification, with an overall accuracy of 83% The addition of ScanSAR data increases the overall classification accuracies The radar contribution is most pronounced during the earlier season

AB Mapping weed infestations in an annual crop has implications not only for site-specific herbicide applications but also for planning future management strategies and understanding weed ecology. A controlled laboratory experiment, involving detached leaves, was conducted to investigate the potential to discriminate two crop and five weed species using hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing. Stepwise discriminant function analyses showed that reflectance in the visible and "red-edge" regions of the spectrum were consistently required for species discrimination. The seven species were correctly identified 90 and 89% of the time using the hyperspectral and multispectral data, respectively, and the classification rules derived from discriminant function analyses. Errant species prediction with the hyperspectral data resulted in a grass being predicted as a grass and a broadleaf as a broadleaf. However, for multispectral data, incorrect classifications were more serious because errant predictions sometimes resulted in a grass being classified as a broadleaf and vice-versa. Further studies using plants at a variety of growth stages, from a variety of environments, and at the canopy level are warranted.

AB This paper focuses on the application of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to the classification of remote sensing hyperspectral data. The specific aim of the work is to obtain accurate thematic maps of soybean crops, which have proven to be difficult to identify by automated procedures. The classification process carried out is as follows: First, spectral data is transformed into a hyper-spherical representation. Second, a robust image gradient is computed over the hyper-spherical representation allowing an image segmentation that identifies major crop plots. Third, feature selection is achieved by a greedy wrapper approach. Finally, a classifier is trained and tested on the selected image pixel features. The classifiers used for feature selection and final classification are Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFN) trained with either the ELM or the incremental OP-ELM. Original image pixel features are computed following a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) characterization of the spectral data. Conventional ELM training of the SLFN improves over the classification performance of state of the art algorithms reported in the literature dealing with the data treated in this paper. Moreover, SLFN-ELM uses less features than the referred algorithms. OP-ELM is able to find competitive results using the FDA features from a single spectral band. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB To date, industry and crop forecasters have had a good idea of the potential crop yield for a specific season, but early-season information on crop area for a shire or region has been mostly unavailable. The question of "how early and with what accuracy?" area estimates can be determined using multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery was investigated in this paper. The study was conducted for two shires in Queensland, Australia for the 2003 and 2004 seasons, and focused on deriving total winter crop area estimates (including wheat, barley and chickpea). A simple metric (Delta E), which measures the green-up rate of the crop canopy, was derived. Using the unsupervised k-means classification algorithm, the accumulated difference of two consecutive images (one month apart) for three EVI threshold cut-offs (Delta E(i), where i = 250, 500 and 750) at monthly intervals from April to October was calculated. July showed the highest pixel accuracy with percent correctly classified for all thresholds of 94% and 98% for 2003 and 2004, respectively. The differences in accuracy between the three cut-offs were minimal and the T500 threshold was selected as the preferred cut-off to avoid measuring too small or too large fluctuations in the differential EVI values. When compared to the aggregated shire data (surveyed) on crop area across shires and seasons, average percent differences for the Delta E(T500) for July and August ranged from -19% to 9%. To capture most of the variability in green-up within a region, the average Delta E(T500) of July and August was used for the early-season prediction of total winter crop area estimates. This resulted in high accuracy (R(2) = 0.96; RMSE = 3157 ha) for predicting the total winter crop from 2000 to 2004 across both shires. This result indicated that this simple multi-temporal remote sensing approach could be used with confidence in early-season crop area prediction at least one to two months ahead of anthesis.

AB Powdery mildew is one of the dominant diseases in winter wheat. The accurate monitoring of powdery mildew is important for crop management and production. Satellite-based remote sensing monitoring has been proven as an efficient tool for regional disease detection and monitoring. However, the information provided by single-date satellite scene is hard to achieve acceptable accuracy for powdery mildew disease, and incorporation of early period contextual information of winter wheat can improve this situation. In this study, a multi-temporal satellite data based powdery mildew detecting approach had been developed for regional disease mapping. Firstly, the Lansat-8 scenes that covered six winter wheat growth periods (expressed in chronological order as periods 1 to 6) were collected to calculate typical vegetation indices (VIs), which include disease water stress index (DSWI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI), and triangular vegetation index (TVI). A multi-temporal VIs-based k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach was then developed to produce the regional disease distribution. Meanwhile, a backward stepwise elimination method was used to confirm the optimal multi-temporal combination for KNN monitoring model. A classification and regression tree (CART) and back propagation neural networks (BPNN) approaches were used for comparison and validation of initial results. VIs of all periods except 1 and 3 provided the best multi-temporal data set for winter wheat powdery mildew monitoring. Compared with the traditional single-date (period 6) image, the multi-temporal images based KNN approach provided more disease information during the disease development, and had an accuracy of 84.6%. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the proposed approach had 11.5% and 3.8% higher than the multi-temporal images-based CART and BPNN models', respectively. These results suggest that the use of satellite images for early critical disease infection periods is essential for improving the accuracy of monitoring models. Additionally, satellite imagery also assists in monitoring powdery mildew in late wheat growth periods.

AB We propose here a fuzzy hybrid methodology for the classification, conceived as a cognitive process, of remote sensing images. The salient aspect of the approach is the combined use of different techniques: the linear mixture model, a supervised fuzzy statistical classifier and a fuzzy labeling technique, An application for the identification of rice crops in a Landsat Thematic Mapper image has been developed with the aim of experimentally evaluating the performance of the overall strategy in a real domain where fuzzy membership to classes are essential in class discrimination, The results have then been compared with those obtained by means of the Maximum Likelihood classifier.

AB In many fields in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, a soil-borne fungus (Phymatotrichopsis omnivorum) causes a disease called cotton root rot (CRR) that can devastate a cotton crop by infecting the roots and destroying large numbers of cotton plants. In the last few years a fungicide treatment including the chemical, flutriafol, has proven effective at protecting cotton plants from CRR infection. However, the fungicide is expensive, and growers desire to minimize input costs and environmental risks, so it is desirable to treat only the portions of the field susceptible to CRR infection. Remote sensing with high-resolution satellites and manned aircraft has enabled delineation of the full extent of the disease late in the growing season. Recently, classified images have been used effectively to create prescription maps for variable-rate application of fungicide when planting a cotton crop in subsequent years. In 2015 a UAV was used to create a high-resolution image mosaic of a CRR-infected field at Thrall, Texas. The mosaic was classified into healthy and CRR-infected small zones, and a prescription map was created from the mosaic for variable-rate fungicide application during planting in 2017. The method proved as effective as uniform application across the field would have been. Furthermore, image-analysis techniques were developed that enable classification of image mosaics at approximately the single-plant level. Thus in the future it is conceivable that precision application of flutriafol during planting to prevent cotton root rot could be done at the level of a single seed.

AB Background Studies on dynamics of land use change still rely on survey questionnaires to collect the data. This study was undertaken to explore the possibility of an appropriate method for estimating land use land cover (LULC) changes for temporal periods for which there is no direct evidence of change spatially explicit. Purpose The hypothesis of this study is that the data on land use generated by official records, empirical field studies, and analysis of satellite imagery resemble with each other. However, in case of inconsistencies the aim of the present study was to identify a scientific and effective method for obtaining precise data on land use dynamics as part of developing appropriate strategies for a sustainable land use management. Methods The land use information on taluk (block) level was collected from the official records. A questionnaire-based survey was done for collecting household data on land use during the period 2014-2016. Furthermore, satellite data were analysed for land use change estimation. In this study, the conventional methods as well as advanced techniques have been used for estimating crop area at various spatial scales. Per pixel classification techniques were used for generating thematic maps from raster data sets. Data collected from GPS were converted into a shape file for generating a signature file for classification of satellite data sets. While generating thematic maps, the maximum likelihood and parallelepiped classification methods were used. Results The inconsistencies were found between land use data obtained from field studies/official records and the data obtained from analysis of remote-sensing imagery. The satellite data outputs are validated using ground-truth data. Various accuracy assessment metrics such as overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (K-hat) are computed from the validation procedure. The overall accuracy and K-hat of the generated thematic maps on LULC are found to be ranging from 79 to 84% and 0.76 to 0.83 for various points of time. However, data obtained from official records and results obtained through questionnaire-based survey could not be cross-checked for an accuracy assessment as the physical conditions of land significantly differ year by year. Conclusion An overall spatial and temporal assessment of land use data, using only a questionnaire-based survey, is not scientifically appropriate. Therefore, this study advocates a trans-disciplinary research in social science based on the convergence of social science and space science and technology.

AB Cloudy conditions reduce the utility of optical imagery for crop monitoring. New constellations of satellites - including the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) and Sentinel-1A/B, both available under free and open data policies - can be used to create stacks of dense seasonal C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Yet to date, the contribution of SAR imagery to operational crop mapping is often limited to that of a gap-filler, compensating for optical data obscured by clouds. The Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) SAR Inter-Comparison Experiment is a multi-year, multi-partner project focused on evaluating methods for SAR-based crop classification. Stacks of dense time-series SAR imagery, from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, were acquired for 10 sites located in six countries. Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) classification methodologies were applied to these SAR data-stacks, as well as to data-stacks of optical only, and optimized SAR/optical data combinations. For the dense time-series SAR stacks, overall classification accuracies above 85% and 80% were obtained for 6 of 10 and 8 of 10 sites, respectively. For maize, the SAR-only data delivered user's and producer's accuracies greater than 90% for half the sites. For soya bean, accuracies greater than 80% were reported for 5 of 9 sites and classification accuracies were greater than 80% for wheat on half the sites. Classification results were influenced by the mix and number of agriculture classes present at each site, the available SAR imagery, as well as the training and validation data sets for individual crop types. These results have important operational implications for regions of the world dominated by cloudy conditions and the lack of adequate amounts of optical imagery to support satellite-based crop monitoring.

AB Accurate estimation of areas covered by land use land cover classes is central to many resource management and monitoring programs, crop yield forecasting, forest and environmental management. In this paper, various techniques of estimating areas of land cover classes derived from remote sensing image classification have been discussed. A comparative study has been conducted to examine the accuracy and consistency of the area estimated from five error matrix based techniques. The results show that 'direct' and 'additive' estimators produce the most accurate and consistent results. The 'map marginal proportion based estimator' and 'inverse estimator' produce accurate results when the testing sample size is large.

ID ACCURACY
AB The accuracy of conventional land use classification of irrigated agriculture from optical satellite images using maximum likelihood supervised classification was compared with a classification based on multistage maximum likelihood supervised classification. In the multistage maximum likelihood classification series of sub-classifications were carried out which included masking and/or omitting certain crops from the classifications. These series of classifications improved the identification of individual crops/land use types. The output from the optimum sub-classifications were stacked to give an overall crop types/land use map. When the multistage classification was tested against a single stage classification on a large irrigation scheme in Central Asia the final accuracy of crop/land use classification increased from 85% to 94%. Field verification confirmed the accuracy at 93.5%. These results were achieved with a single Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor dataset as of 2 August 1999 over an area of 38.5 km(2).

AB The objective of this study was to define a method for estimating soybean crop area in the Northern Rio Grande do Sul state (Brazil). Overall, six different remote sensing methods were proposed based on spectral-temporal profile and minimum and maximum values of NDVI/MODIS related to the stages of sowing, maximum development and harvesting of soybean areas. The resulting estimates were compared to official crop area data provided by the Brazilian government, using statistical analysis and the fuzzy similarity method. The performance of each method depended on information such as crop size, type of crop management, and sowing/harvesting dates. Regression coefficients of determination and fuzzy agreement values were above 0.8 and 0.45, respectively, for all methods. For operational monitoring of soybean crop area, the empirical threshold applied to the image difference with inclusion of harvest image method was the most effective, producing estimates that matched closely the official data. For spatial analysis the application of multitemporal images classification method is recommended that generated a map of better quality. The efficiency of these methods should be evaluated in the areas of soybean expansion in the state.

AB Multitemporal remote-sensing images play a key role as a source of information for automated crop mapping and monitoring. The spatial/spectral pattern evolution along time provides information about the dynamics of the crops and are very useful for productivity estimation. Although the multitemporal mapping of crops has progressed considerably with the advent of deep learning in recent years, the classification models obtained still have limitations when exposed to unknown classes in the prediction phase, reducing their usefulness. In other words, these models are trained to identify a closed set of crops (e.g., soy and sugar cane) and are therefore unable to recognize other types of crops (e.g., maize). In this letter, we deal with the challenges of multitemporal crop recognition by proposing a new approach called OpenPCS++ that is not only able to learn known classes but is also capable of identifying new crops in the predicting phase. The proposed approach was evaluated in two challenging public datasets located in tropical climates in Brazil. Results showed that OpenPCS++ achieved increases of up to 0.19 in terms of area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve in comparison with baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/DiMorten/osss-mcr.

AB Energy transition strategies in Germany have led to an expansion of energy crop cultivation in landscape, with silage maize as most valuable feedstock. The changes in the traditional cropping systems, with increasing shares of maize, raised concerns about the sustainability of agricultural feedstock production regarding threats to soil health. However, spatially explicit data about silage maize cultivation are missing; thus, implications for soil cannot be estimated in a precise way. With this study, we firstly aimed to track the fields cultivated with maize based on remote sensing data. Secondly, available soil data were target-specifically processed to determine the site-specific vulnerability of the soils for erosion and compaction. The generated, spatially-explicit data served as basis for a differentiated analysis of the development of the agricultural biogas sector, associated maize cultivation and its implications for soil health. In the study area, located in a low mountain range region in Western Germany, the number and capacity of biogas producing units increased by 25 installations and 10,163 kW from 2009 to 2016. The remote sensing-based classification approach showed that the maize cultivation area was expanded by 16% from 7305 to 8447 hectares. Thus, maize cultivation accounted for about 20% of the arable land use; however, with distinct local differences. Significant shares of about 30% of the maize cultivation was done on fields that show at least high potentials for soil erosion exceeding 25 t soil ha(-1) a(-1). Furthermore, about 10% of the maize cultivation was done on fields that pedogenetically show an elevated risk for soil compaction. In order to reach more sustainable cultivation systems of feedstock for anaerobic digestion, changes in cultivated crops and management strategies are urgently required, particularly against first signs of climate change. The presented approach can regionally be modified in order to develop site-adapted, sustainable bioenergy cropping systems.

AB Crop mapping and acreage estimation are the simplest yet the most critical issues in agriculture. Remote sensing technology has been extensively used in the past few decades for executing these tasks. The objective of this study is to map sugarcane fields at a catchment level and segregate the plant and ratoon fields using the freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The study is carried out at the Kisan Sahkar Chini Mill catchment in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The objective was achieved by a two-step process where firstly the sugarcane fields are identified using Random Forest and SVM classifiers over temporal optical and microwave images. The most accurate result is used as a crop mask to separate the plant and ratoon fields. This was achieved by attempting a phenology based classification and spectral based classification. The results revealed that temporal Sentinel-2 data are highly competent in classifying sugarcane at farm level and segregating the plant and ratoon fields. The sugarcane crop mask was created with a kappa coefficient of 0.95 using the SVM classifier, and the plant and ratoon fields were discriminated using the Random Forest classifier with a kappa coefficient of 0.81. The sugarcane crop area was estimated to be approximately 535 acres of plant crop and 560 acres of the ratoon crop while the mill estimate was 520 acres and 540 acres, respectively. The results showed that Sentinel-2 has promising capabilities and is a convenient asset in delineating small-sized farms and classifying sugarcane and its crop types.

AB Recent articles are indicating that polarimetric data provide significantly more information than conventional or multi-polarized images, particularly due to the additional phase information. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the multi-polarized and fully polarimetric L-band airborne SAR-R99B data, in terms of their capability to distinguish among different agricultural crops in the western part of Bahia State, Brazil. Emphasis was given to coffee, cotton and pasture crops which were at well developed growing stages. Discrimination among crops was carried out using graphical analysis of mean backscatter values. Crop classification was performed for single and multiple polarizations, and fully polarimetric images with a classifier that uses the contextual Iterated Conditional Modes - ICM algorithm. The investigation confirmed the potential of L-band multi-polarized and polarimetric airborne SAR-R99B data to distinguish and classify agricultural crops in the tropical condition of the test-site. In addition, it clearly indicated the gradual and considerable improvement that was achieved going from single to three polarizations and from multi-polarized to fully polarimetric images.

AB With an ever expanding population, potential climate variability and an increasing demand for agriculture-based alternative fuels, accurate agricultural land-cover classification for specific crops and their spatial distributions are becoming critical to researchers, policymakers, land managers and farmers. It is important to ensure the sustainability of these and other land uses and to quantify the net impacts that certain management practices have on the environment. Although other quality crop classification products are often available, temporal and spatial coverage gaps can create complications for certain regional or time-specific applications. Our goal was to develop a model capable of classifying major crops in the Greater Platte River Basin (GPRB) for the post-2000 era to supplement existing crop classification products. This study identifies annual spatial distributions and area totals of corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops across the GPRB from 2000 to 2009. We developed a regression tree classification model based on 2.5 million training data points derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) in relation to a variety of other relevant input environmental variables. The primary input variables included the weekly 250 m US Geological Survey Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized differential vegetation index, average long-term growing season temperature, average long-term growing season precipitation and yearly start of growing season. An overall model accuracy rating of 78% was achieved for a test sample of roughly 215 000 independent points that were withheld from model training. Ten 250 m resolution annual crop classification maps were produced and evaluated for the GPRB region, one for each year from 2000 to 2009. In addition to the model accuracy assessment, our validation focused on spatial distribution and county-level crop area totals in comparison with the NASS CDL and county statistics from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Census of Agriculture. The results showed that our model produced crop classification maps that closely resembled the spatial distribution trends observed in the NASS CDL and exhibited a close linear agreement with county-by-county crop area totals from USDA census data (R-2 = 0.90).

AB Agricultural monitoring over large areas such as the irrigation zones of the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) needs Remote Sensing imagery with a high temporal resolution and a large swath width. Satellite sensors such as MODIS or the upcoming Sentinel-3 suits these requirements. A clear discrimination of active cropland coverage however is impossible using low spatial resolution imagery due to mixed pixel effects with other landcover types. In this paper we utilized Landsat 8 data and present the derivation of the active cropland in the ASB for 3 consecutive years (2014-2016). Each observed year comprises two growing seasons (spring and summer) with 40 Landsat scenes in each season, with a total of 240 Landsat scenes. Due to the lack of adequate in-situ data for remote agricultural regions, a feature extraction method based on image segmentation and k-means clustering is applied to delineate samples of agricultural fields which are forwarded to machine learning algorithms for image classification including. A simple markovian logic is used to introduce prior distribution values the following observation year. The results clearly show, that the extraction of active cropland is possible without the need for time series data, which is limited due to clouds and acquisition date irregularity. Model transferability tests were performed to assess machine learning inference on unseen data with training datasets from adjacent or non-adjacent scenes. The extraction of active cropland for each season also yielded secondary information such as the assessment of land use intensities and crop rotation patterns.

AB Crop sequence history both describes results of on-farm decision-making processes and signals potential environmental impacts across landscapes. Remote sensing classifications for 11 yr in western Oregon identified multi-year production of established perennial crops and successive plantings of annual crops, quantified durations, and defined frequencies of pre- and post-crops for multi-year production periods. Measuring duration of continuous production of specific crops and characterizing crop sequence patterns required: (i) optimizing year-to-year landuse consistency and within-year landuse classification accuracy, (ii) sufficiently detailed landuse classes to capture 99% of all crops grown in the diverse agriculture of this region, and (iii) enough years of data that majorities of fields experienced at least one full cycle of planting new stands of perennial grass seed crops (or successive plantings of specific annual crops), maintaining those fields in production until their eventual termination, and subsequent planting of new crops. Averaged over all possible starting and ending years between 2004 and 2014, continuous production of the same crop on the same field ranged from highs of 2.9, 4.6, 3.7, and 5.9 yr for perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.)], and Italian ryegrass [L. perenne L. subsp. multiflorum (Lam.) Husnot] grown for seed to lows of 2.4 and 1.5 yr for clovers grown for seed and cereal grains. With very few exceptions, pre-crop frequencies were stable over the period of the study. Variability in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue stand duration included strong local components in which fields with much longer or shorter than average stand durations were oft en found in close proximity to one another.

AB Crop classification in early phenological stages has been a difficult task due to spectrum similarity of different crops. For this purpose, low altitude platforms such as drones have great potential to provide high resolution optical imagery where Machine Learning (ML) applied to classify different types of crops. In this research work, crop classification is performed at different phenological stages using optical images which are obtained from drone. For this purpose, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based features are extracted from underlying gray scale images collected by the drone. To classify the different types of crops, different ML algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied. The results showed that the ML algorithms performed much better on GLCM features as compared to gray scale images with a margin of 13.65% in overall accuracy.

AB Successful identification and mapping of different cropping patterns under cloudy conditions of a specific crop through remote sensing provides important baseline information for planning and monitoring. In Vietnam, this information is either missing or unavailable; several ongoing projects studying options with radar to avoid earth observation problems caused by the prevailing cloudy conditions have to date produced only partial successes. In this research, optical hyper-temporal Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) VEGETATION (SPOT VGT) data (1998-2008) were used to describe and map variability in irrigated rice cropping patterns of the Mekong delta. Divergence statistics were used to evaluate signature separabilities of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) classes generated from the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA) classification of 10-day SPOT NDVI image series. Based on this evaluation, a map with 77 classes was selected. Out of these 77 mapped classes, 26 classes with prior knowledge that they represent rice were selected to design the sampling scheme for fieldwork and for crop calendar characterization. Using the collected information of 112 farmers' fields belonging to the 26 selected classes, the map produced provides highly accurate information on rice cropping patterns (94% overall accuracy, 0.93 Kappa coefficient). We found that the spatial distributions of the triple and the double rice cropping systems are highly related to the flooding regime from the Hau and Tien rivers. Areas that are highly vulnerable to flooding in the upper part and those that are saline in the north-western part of the delta mostly have a double rice cropping system, whilst areas in the central and the south-eastern parts mostly have a triple rice cropping system. In turn, the duration of flooding is highly correlated with the decision by farmers to cultivate shorter or longer duration rice varieties. The overall spatial variability mostly coincides with administrative units, indicating that crop pattern choices and water control measures are locally synchronized. Water supply risks, soil acidity and salinity constraints and the anticipated highly fluctuating rice market prices all strongly influence specific farmers' choices of rice varieties. These choices vary considerably annually, and therefore grown rice varieties are difficult to map. Our study demonstrates the high potential of optical hyper-temporal images, taken on a daily basis, to differentiate and map a high variety of irrigated rice cropping patterns and crop calendars at a high level of accuracy in spite of cloudy conditions.

AB Mapping irrigated areas using remotely sensed imagery has been widely applied to support agricultural water management; however, accuracy is often compromised by the in-field heterogeneity of and interannual variability in crop conditions. This paper addresses these key issues. Two classification methods were employed to map irrigated fields using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values derived from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8: a dynamic thresholding method (method one) and a random forest method (method two). To improve the representativeness of field-level NDVI aggregates, which are the key inputs in our methods, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based filtering approach was adopted to remove noncrop pixels (e.g., trees and bare soils) and mixed pixels along the field boundary. To improve the temporal transferability of method one we dynamically determined the threshold value to account for the impact of interannual weather variability based on the dynamic range of NDVI values. In method two an innovative training sample pool was designed for the random forest modeling to enable automatic calibration for each season, which contributes to consistent performance across years. The irrigated field mapping was applied to a major irrigation district in Australia from 2011 to 2018, for summer and winter cropping seasons separately. The results showed that using GMM-based filtering can markedly improve field-level data quality and avoid up to 1/3 of omission errors for irrigated fields. Method two showed superior performance, exhibiting consistent and good accuracy (kappa > 0.9) for both seasons. The classified maps in wet winter seasons should be used with caution, because rainfall alone can largely meet plant water requirements, leaving the contribution of irrigation to the surface spectral signature weak. The approaches introduced are transferable to other areas, can support multiyear irrigated area mapping with high accuracy, and significantly reduced model development effort.

AB In the transitioning agricultural societies of the world, food security is an essential element of livelihood and economic development with the agricultural sector very often being the major employment factor and income source. Rapid population growth, urbanization, pollution, desertification, soil degradation and climate change pose a variety of threats to a sustainable agricultural development and can be expressed as agricultural vulnerability components. Diverse cropping patterns may help to adapt the agricultural systems to those hazards in terms of increasing the potential yield and resilience to water scarcity. Thus, the quantification of crop diversity using indices like the Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) e.g. through freely available remote sensing data becomes a very important issue. This however requires accurate land use classifications. In this study, the focus is set on the cropping system diversity of garden plots, summer crop fields and orchard plots which are the prevalent agricultural systems in the test area of the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan. In order to improve the accuracy of land use classification algorithms with low or medium resolution data, a novel processing chain through the hitherto unique fusion of optical and SAR data from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 platforms is proposed. The combination of both sensors is intended to enhance the object's textural and spectral signature rather than just to enhance the spatial context through pansharpening. It could be concluded that the Ehlers fusion algorithm gave the most suitable results. Based on the derived image fusion different object-based image classification algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayesian and Random Forest were evaluated whereby the latter one achieved the highest classification accuracy. Subsequently, the SID was applied to measure the diversification of the three main cropping systems.

TI Classification of Daily Crop Phenology in PhenoCams Using Deep Learning
   and Hidden Markov Models

AB Near-surface cameras, such as those in the PhenoCam network, are a common source of ground truth data in modelling and remote sensing studies. Despite having locations across numerous agricultural sites, few studies have used near-surface cameras to track the unique phenology of croplands. Due to management activities, crops do not have a natural vegetation cycle which many phenological extraction methods are based on. For example, a field may experience abrupt changes due to harvesting and tillage throughout the year. A single camera can also record several different plants due to crop rotations, fallow fields, and cover crops. Current methods to estimate phenology metrics from image time series compress all image information into a relative greenness metric, which discards a large amount of contextual information. This can include the type of crop present, whether snow or water is present on the field, the crop phenology, or whether a field lacking green plants consists of bare soil, fully senesced plants, or plant residue. Here, we developed a modelling workflow to create a daily time series of crop type and phenology, while also accounting for other factors such as obstructed images and snow covered fields. We used a mainstream deep learning image classification model, VGG16. Deep learning classification models do not have a temporal component, so to account for temporal correlation among images, our workflow incorporates a hidden Markov model in the post-processing. The initial image classification model had out of sample F1 scores of 0.83-0.85, which improved to 0.86-0.91 after all post-processing steps. The resulting time series show the progression of crops from emergence to harvest, and can serve as a daily, local-scale dataset of field states and phenological stages for agricultural research.

AB For the two of the most important agricultural commodities, soybean and corn, remote sensing plays a substantial role in delivering timely information on the crop area for economic, environmental and policy studies. Traditional long-term mapping of soybean and corn is challenging as a result of the high cost of repeated training data collection, the inconsistency in image process and interpretation, and the difficulty of handling the inter-annual variability of weather and crop progress. In this study, we developed an automated approach to map soybean and corn in the state of Parana, Brazil for crop years 2010-2015. The core of the approach is a decision tree classifier with rules manually built based on expert interaction for repeated use. The automated approach is advantageous for its capacity of multi-year mapping without the need to re-train or re-calibrate the classifier. Time series MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance product (MCD43A4) were employed to derive vegetation phenology to identify soybean and corn based on crop calendar. To deal with the phenological similarity between soybean and corn, the surface reflectance of the shortwave infrared band scaled to a phenological stage was used to fully separate the two crops. Results suggested that the mapped areas of soybean and corn agreed with official statistics at the municipal level. The resultant map in the crop year 2012 was evaluated using an independent reference data set, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 87.2% and 0.804 respectively. As a result of mixed pixel effect at the 500 m resolution, classification results were biased depending on topography. In the flat, broad and highly-cropped areas, uncultivated lands were likely to be identified as soybean or corn, causing over-estimation of cropland area. By contrast, scattered crop fields in mountainous regions with dense natural vegetation tend to be overlooked. For future mapping efforts, it has great potential to apply the automated mapping algorithm to other image series at various scales especially high-resolution images. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Monitoring pests and diseases is an extremely important activity for increasing productivity in agriculture. In this scenario, remote sensing, coupled with techniques of machine learning, offer new prospects for monitoring and identifying characteristic specific patterns, such as manifestations of diseases, pests, and water and nutritional stress. The aim was to use high spatial resolution aerial images to monitor the extent of an attack of yellow sigatoka in a banana crop, following the basic assumptions of identification, classification, quantification and prediction of phenotypic factors. Monthly flights were carried out on a commercial banana plantation using an unmanned aerial vehicle, equipped with a 16-megapixel RGB camera (GSD of 0.016781 m pixel(-1)). Five classification algorithms were used to identify and quantify the disease while field evaluations were also made following traditional methodology. The results showed that, for September 2017, the Support Vector Machine algorithm achieved the best performance (99.28% overall accuracy and 97.13 Kappa Index), followed by the Artificial Neural Network and Minimum Distance algorithms. In quantifying the disease, the SVM algorithm was more effective than other algorithms compared to the conventional methodology used to estimate the extent of yellow sigatoka, demonstrating that the tools used for monitoring leaf spots can be handled by remote sensing, machine learning and high spatial-resolution RGB images.

AB Crop type maps are often generated using remotely sensed data acquired by sensors mounted on satellites, manned aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or 'drones'), the most popular being multispectral sensors mounted on satellites. Aerial multispectral sensors are more frequently employed where imagery with very high spatial resolution is required. However, the use of Lidar data for crop type mapping is still uncommon. This article outlines research done on creating crop type maps using Lidar, Sentinel-2 and aerial data along with several machine learning classification algorithms for differentiating four crop types in an intensively cultivated area.

AB Phythophthora disease, Gummosis, in Citrus crop results in huge yield losses every year. The purpose of this study is to detect the Gummosis disease infested fields using remote sensing and meteorological data. We present the use of participatory sensing framework to collect the reliable ground truth data about the disease incidences. Various vegetation, soil and water indices have been derived from Landsat-8 data and morphometric parameters of watershed from ASTER DEM. These parameters along with meteorological data are used as a large feature set which is then reduced using the LASSO and Elastic Net regularization techniques. We evaluate SVM, Naive Bayes and ANN based classifiers for three class classification between healthy, low and high disease infested fields. Results depicts that a combination of LASSO regularization with ANN classifier outscores the other approaches considered in this paper.

AB In agricultural remote sensing, applied images should be acquired frequently enough in order to monitor important crop growth stages. Thanks to the cloud penetrating and flexible swath-positioning capabilities of space-borne SAR at present, images can be acquired even at the interval of few days during a growing season. In this study, dual-polarization (VV/VH) Envisat SAR images with high a temporal resolution were used in association with limited ancillary data to monitor crop growth and to classify crop species. It was noticed that the high temporal resolution enabled nearly continuous monitoring, but it also caused problems because of the varying incidence angles. Moreover, to carry outfield surveys rapidly enough for research purposes was observed as a problem. An R-2 of 0.55 was obtained for estimating the crop growth, when average crop height in parcels was used to describe the amount of biomass. An overall accuracy of 74.7 percent was achieved for crop species classification. Envisat VH polarization appeared to be useful in the estimation, even though, the noise equivalent sigma(0) was too high to detect early crop growth. Field-based averaging was required, thus, for example for precision farming purposes a better spatial resolution would be needed to detect biomass variations within parcels.

AB Stressed on crop can be monitored using different indices. Red Edge position is good estimator for stress monitoring. The red edge position (REP) is strongly correlated with foliar chlorophyll content. Strong chlorophyll absorption causes the abrupt change in the 680-800nm region of reflectance spectra of green vegetation. The red edge consist the point of maximum slope between red and near-infrared wavelengths. REP can be used to recognize green zone of the observation area. The REP is present in spectra for vegetation recorded by remote sensing methods. REP is clearer and significant in hyper spectral data as hyper spectral consist of more and continuous bands data. In this paper experiments were carried out for mulberry crop using USGS EO-1 Hyperion data. Atmospheric corrected data is used for classification. Classification is carried out on small cluster of 14 field samples. Ground truth is verified and classified by comparing with Hyperion data. REP is different for different stressed condition of crops and shows healthy and diseased crop condition. Nutritional stresses, diseases, drought of plants are detected using REP. Stressed and healthy field of mulberry are estimated by calculating REP using maximum first derivative, linear interpolation, linear extrapolation method. Finally REP is compared using above methods. It is noticeable difference of REP for healthy and stressed crop. The research indicates that overall accuracy using maximum first derivative was 92.85 % and it was more compared to other methods. Linear extrapolation gives less accuracy compared to linear interpolation method.

ID TIME-SERIES; ACCURACY; VARIABILITY; MODIS
AB Nowadays it's still very difficult to find accurate information on land-cover areas and types, which mainly results from the confusion between land use types and land cover types (e.g., many researchers equated land cover with land use and land use types were often employed for the replacements of land cover types) and the absence of a standard land cover classification system with an unambiguous, repeatable definition of land cover and quantificational classification criteria so as to the classification result comparable. In this study, a new logic for land cover classification at regional scale has been introduced. The critical features of this classification are that: it's indeed distinguished from land use classification system and driven by remote sensing so that repeatable and efficient re-classifications of existing land cover will be possible; spectrum and primary attributes of plant-canopy structure (i.e. permanence of aboveground live biomass, leaf longevity and leaf type) are adopted as the primary criterions of land cover classification; based on the phonological difference among broadly defined vegetation, some typical land cover is easily distinguished by using the characteristics of seasonal dynamic; mixed land cover is differentiated by its constituent characteristics and influence on land surface processes. Taking the areas between Yangtze River Basin and Weihe River Basin in China as a case and using time-series MODIS 250 m data (i.e. NDVI and reflectance), a two-level hierarchical land cover classification scheme was produced for the areas. At the initial stage, the entire study area was mapped into seven classes, i.e. evergreen cover (woody), seasonal green cover (woody), seasonal green cover (herbaceous), seasonal green cover (crops), seasonal green cover (mixed), grey cover (non-vegetated and terrestrial) and blue cover (aquatic or regularly flooded). The sub-classes includes Coniferous evergreen forest, Broadleaf deciduous forest, Single cropping in one year, Continuous double cropping in one year, grassland, Wetland, Urban or Built-up land, Barren or Sparsely land, River, Lake, Mixed Cover of Crop and tree, etc.

AB Enormous volumes of data made available by the high-resolution satellite imagery enable us to use a deep framework in the field of remote sensing for image classification. Recently, deep learning has been an area of interest for the researchers in the computer vision domain due to its high efficiency toward large-scale, high-dimensional data. In this letter, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster hybrid polarimetric SAR images, and dual-polarized SAR images using the deep framework. We use feature extraction layers of the VGG16 model with batch normalization, which is trained with small patches derived from the hybrid polarimetric SAR images. It uses an entropy-based loss function and an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, Adam, for training. Broadly, the patches are segmented into three classes, namely, surface, volume, and double-bounce, which are defined with reference to the SAR scattering characteristics. Furthermore, we classify volume into dense forest region and agricultural crop fields. We also observe mixed classes between volume and double-bounce, mainly covering the settlements surrounded by areas covered by tall trees. Furthermore, we use transfer learning for generating the labels for dual-polarized images by using the learned weights of a hybrid polarized image model. Such a technique renders an average accuracy of 89.70% and 86.08% for hybrid polarized SAR images and dual-polarized SAR images, respectively. Hence, this method explores the spatial characteristics of remotely sensed images to distinguish urban settlements, water bodies, agricultural, and forest areas from the underlying scene in an unsupervised fashion.

AB The fragmented nature of arable landscapes and diverse cropping patterns often thwart the precise mapping of crop types. Recent advances in remote-sensing technologies and data mining approaches offer a viable solution to this mapping problem. We demonstrated the potential of using hyperspectral imaging and an ensemble classification approach that combines five machine-learning classifiers to map crop types in the Anand District of Gujarat, India. We derived a set of narrow/broad-band indices from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) imagery to represent spectral variations and identify target classes and their distribution patterns. The results showed that Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Generalised Linear Model (GLM) had strong discriminatory image classification abilities with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values ranging between 0.75 and 0.93 for MaxEnt and between 0.73 and 0.92 for GLM. The ensemble model resulted in improved accuracy scores compared to individual models. We found the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and Moment Distance Ratio Right/Left (MDRRL) to be important predictors for target classes such as wheat, legumes, and eggplant. Results from the study revealed the potential of using one-class ensemble modelling approach and hyperspectral images with limited field dataset to map agricultural systems that are fragmented in nature.

AB Remote sensing time series imagery (RSTSI) provides a useful tool for crop mapping, as it provides crucial spectral, temporal, and spatial (STS) features. However, its high dimensionality coupled with the limited number of training samples leads to an ill-posed classification problem and the Hughes phenomenon. To solve this problem, this study presents a multiple-feature-driven co-training method (MFDC) for accurately mapping crop types based on RSTSI with a limited number of training samples. In MFDC, four complementary pre-defined views, which represent STS features, are generated for the utilization of multiple features. Then, to enhance the classifier's generalization ability, a novel labelled sample augmentation method that combines the Breaking Tiles algorithm and co-training is proposed. Third, to ensure the effectiveness of ensemble learning in co-training as well as to further speed up the learning process, a multi-view semi-supervised feature learning algorithm that expands the single view semi-supervised learning algorithm to multiple views is proposed and embedded in co-training. Finally, a weighted majority vote method is utilized to obtain the classification results. The experimental results for study areas in the United States indicate that the proposed method can accurately map crop types with a limited number of labelled training samples without a significant computational cost.

AB In recent years, the increase in demand for food resources leads to the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations which is one of the more prominent commercial crops for countries located near the Equator. To cope with the expansion, a better plantation monitoring system is required which can be done via satellite remote sensing. Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the prominent biophysical properties of oil palms used by many to determine the overall health of oil palms and LAI is also monitored and maintained at a certain level to optimize fruit productivity. Therefore, it is important for plantation manager to monitor the LAI of plantation plots over time to perform optimization measures where microwave remote sensing can be used to aid them in monitoring their plantations. This paper attempts to explore the relationship between LAI of oil palm with microwave backscatter and later uses Deep Learning (DL) to classify the oil palm plots based on their LAI. Ground truth measurements were conducted in Lekir Estate, Perak state, Malaysia in October 2013 to obtain the vegetative parameters of oil palms together with C band microwave image from Radarsat-2 taken during the same time period. First, the relationship between LAI of oil palms and satellite data processed through entropy decomposition was studied in order to obtain a clearer picture on how LAI of oil palms affects microwave backscattering mechanism. Unsupervised Entropy Decomposition with Wishart Classifier was then used to cluster the data in order to observe the separability of the data in terms of LAI. Due to the constraint of C band data with fast attenuation of signal within the palm canopy, only 3 clusters can be obtained from the Lekir Estate microwave image which are ground, young palms (lesser than 3 years old) and mature palms (older than 3 years). Based on this information, ground truth information is then prepared into the three particular classes as training data for supervised classification. Deep Neural Network (DNN) via Caffe framework was used to perform the classification. In the first experiment, classification was done with entropy decomposition data where H and Alpha were used as input data for the DNN. DNN managed to obtain testing accuracy of 72.1%. To improve accuracy, another experiment using calibrated intensity data was used instead. DNN managed to obtain 83.33% testing accuracy for this experiment. This shows that modern machine learning classifier works better with raw data instead of processed data such as entropy decomposition as processed data have loss of potential information. Other than that, this work also found that better data separability in the context of LAI can be achieved if microwave with higher penetration power such as L band or P band to be used.

AB Change detection is one of the most important applications of remote sensing techniques due to its capability of repetitive acquisition imageries with consistent image quality, at short intervals, on a global scale, and during complete seasonal cycles. This paper uses two Landsat ETM+ imageries acquired in 2000 and 2002 respectively to detect change of Guangzhou in southern China during two years using post classification comparison method. Firstly, two remote sensing data are precision geometrically corrected to UTM projection with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3 pixels, and then they are classfied using Maximum Likelihood method respectively. Images are classified into four classes which are water, forest, grass or crop and building, soil or unused land. Sencondly, two classified images are calculated by band geometric algorithm pixel by pixel using programming. The class value of pixel in different year is the same, and then the processed pixel is zero, whereas the processed pixel is assigned to a certain value which represents change from the one land cover type to another during two years. Finally, statistic analyses of change information during two years are computed and the post classification comparison change detection image is outputted. It concludes that the largest change areas are exchanges of building, soil or unused land with grass land, and land covers in Baiyun district are changed mostly from 2000 to 2002.

AB Vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from remote sensing images, are widely used for crop classification. However, vegetation index profiles for different crops with a similar phenology lead to difficulties in discerning these crops both spectrally and temporally. This paper proposes a feature filtering and enhancement (FFE) method to map soybean and maize, two major crops widely cultivated during the summer season in Northeastern China. Different vegetation indices are first calculated and the probability density functions (PDFs) of these indices for the target classes are established based on the hypothesis of normal distribution; the vegetation index images are then filtered using the PDFs to obtain enhanced index images where the pixel values of the target classes are enhanced. Subsequently, the minimum Gini index of each enhanced index image is computed, generating at the same time the weight for every index. A composite enhanced feature image is produced by summing all indices with their weights. Finally, a classification is made from the composite enhanced feature image by thresholding, which is derived automatically based on the samples. The efficiency of the proposed FFE method is compared with the maximum likelihood classification (MLC), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) in a mapping operation to determine the soybean and maize distribution in a county in Northeastern China. The classification accuracies resulting from this comparison show that the FFE method outperforms MLC, and its accuracies are similar to those of SVM and RF, with an overall accuracy of 0.902 and a kappa coefficient of 0.846. This indicates that the FFE method is an appropriate method for crop classification to distinguish crops with a similar phenology. Our research also shows that when the sample size reaches a certain level (e.g., 2000), the mean and standard deviation of the sample are very close to the actual values, which leads to high classification accuracy. In a case where the condition of normal distribution is not fulfilled, the PDF of the vegetation index can be created by a lookup table. Furthermore, as the method is rather simple and explicit, and convenient in terms of computing, it can be used as the backbone for automatic crop mapping operations.

AB Timely and accurate crop type distribution maps are an important inputs for crop yield estimation and production forecasting as multi-temporal images can observe phenological differences among crops. Therefore, time series remote sensing data are essential for crop type mapping, and image composition has commonly been used to improve the quality of the image time series. However, the optimal composition period is unclear as long composition periods (such as compositions lasting half a year) are less informative and short composition periods lead to information redundancy and missing pixels. In this study, we initially acquired daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series by fusing MODIS, Landsat, Gaofen and Huanjing (HJ) NDVI, and then composited the NDVI time series using four strategies (daily, 8-day, 16-day, and 32-day). We used Random Forest to identify crop types and evaluated the classification performances of the NDVI time series generated from four composition strategies in two studies regions from Xinjiang, China. Results indicated that crop classification performance improved as crop separabilities and classification accuracies increased, and classification uncertainties dropped in the green-up stage of the crops. When using daily NDVI time series, overall accuracies saturated at 113-day and 116-day in Bole and Luntai, and the saturated overall accuracies (OAs) were 86.13% and 91.89%, respectively. Cotton could be identified 40 similar to 60 days and 35 similar to 45 days earlier than the harvest in Bole and Luntai when using daily, 8-day and 16-day composition NDVI time series since both producer's accuracies (PAs) and user's accuracies (UAs) were higher than 85%. Among the four compositions, the daily NDVI time series generated the highest classification accuracies. Although the 8-day, 16-day and 32-day compositions had similar saturated overall accuracies (around 85% in Bole and 83% in Luntai), the 8-day and 16-day compositions achieved these accuracies around 155-day in Bole and 133-day in Luntai, which were earlier than the 32-day composition (170-day in both Bole and Luntai). Therefore, when the daily NDVI time series cannot be acquired, the 16-day composition is recommended in this study.

ID MULTITEMPORAL MODIS IMAGES; AGRICULTURE; AREA
AB A geospatial database on the spatial distribution of rice areas and rice cultural types of major rice-producing countries of South and Southeast Asia has been developed in this study using remote-sensing and ancillary data sets. Multitemporal SPOT VGT normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for the period 2009-2010 were used for the analysis. The classification was performed adopting ISODATA clustering to build a non-agricultural area mask followed by rice area mapping. The derived rice area was stratified by logical modelling of ancillary data sets into five rice cultural types: irrigated wet, upland, flood-prone, drought-prone, and deep-water. The uniqueness of this study is a synergistic approach based solely on single-source, high-temporal remote-sensing data coupled with ancillary data, which demonstrate the application of SPOT VGT NDVI data in building a geospatial database for rice crops over a wide spatial extent. This approach was adopted for cost effectivity as the study extent was vast and thus lacking ground truth information. Comparison of the derived rice area against the reported literature values for validation yielded a good correlation (linear coefficient of determination, R-2=0.95-0.99). The high-temporal resolution NDVI data enabled effective characterization of vegetation phenology. The derived spatial outputs can be used in various studies associated with the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields, change detection, and inputs to crop simulation models, which are significantly related to different rice cultural types.

AB Morocco is a primarily arid to semi-arid country. These climatic conditions make irrigation an imperative and inevitable technique. Especially, agriculture has a paramount importance for the national economy. Retrieving of crops and their location as well as their spatial extent is useful information for agricultural planning and better management of irrigation water resource. Remote sensing technology was often used in management and agricultural research. Indeed, it's allows crops extraction and mapping based on phenological characteristics, as well as yield estimation. The study area of this work is the Tadla irrigated perimeter which is characterized by heterogeneous areas and extremely small size fields. Our principal objectives are: (1) the delimitation of the major crops for a good water management, (2) the insulation of sugar beet parcels for modeling its yields. To achieve the traced goals, we have used Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data pan-sharpened to 15 m. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifications were applied to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series of 10 periods. Classifications were calculated for a site of more than 124000 ha. This site was divided into two parts: the first part for selecting, training datasets and the second one for validating the classification results. The SVM and SAM methods classified the principal crops with overall accuracies of 85.27% and 57.17% respectively, and kappa coefficient of 80% and 43% respectively. The study showed the potential of using time-series OLI NDVI data for mapping different crops in irrigated, heterogeneous and undersized parcels in arid and semi-arid environment.

AB Agricultural activities conducted in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya, show a significant decline of productivity levels. In this study, a remote and automatic agricultural monitoring system is presented as an effective alternative to the most traditional in situ measurements and observations. We investigated the use of phenological variables and metrics extracted from satellite in accurate crop classification and monitoring. Vegetation indices extracted from Landsat 8 imagery are capable to track the vegetation development through the year and from them the phenological profile can be retrieved and implemented into a multi-temporal automatic classification process to detect agricultural vegetated areas and to discriminate among different crop species. The phenological profiles extracted by satellite images were compared with crop calendar data, compiled by FAO for the area of interest.

AB Crop segregation in optical remote sensing cannot always be easily achieved among similar species since their spectral response can be similar. We aimed to distinguish fields of two C4 gramineae with similar plant structure and crop calendar, maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), in an agricultural area of the state of Guanajuato, in central Mexico. One hundred and forty-three fields of these two crops were identified and their average spectral signatures were derived at different phenological stages, using digital information from 11 Sentinel 2A/B images, corresponding to the 2019 spring-summer cycle. We also calculated the temporal profile of six spectral indices for each crop, to evaluate seasonal variations and conducted a cropland classification, using the random forests algorithm and different combinations of dates and indices. Results show that segregation of maize and sorghum fields can be achieved due to small differences in the near-infrared region of their spectral signatures and disparities in the rate of decay during the senescence stage. Classification results also confirmed the separability of these two crops, obtaining a very high overall accuracy and kappa values (98.43% and 97.07%, correspondingly) based on the reflectance of nine images and only three spectral indices: the normalized difference vegetation index, the normalized difference water index, and the structure insensitive pigment index. This investigation demonstrates that the combined use of time series of high-resolution images and spectral indices can contribute to distinguish fields of similar crop species.

AB Hyperspectral imaging has been acknowledged as an emerging technology for monitoring quality parameters and improving grading of agricultural materials, such as field crops (e.g., cereals, pulses, oil seeds) and horticultural crops (e.g., apples, strawberries). It has become a popular research tool that facilitates thorough non-destructive analyses by simultaneous acquisition of both spectral and spatial information of agricultural samples. The technique is an extension of multispectral imaging, which provides a large data set by applying conventional imaging, radiometry, and spectroscopic principles when acquiring images. Hyperspectral imaging was initially used for remote sensing applications, but now has been developed to facilitate complete and reliable analyses of intrinsic properties and external characteristics of samples. This paper reviews applications of using hyperspectral imaging for routine grain industry operations such as grading, classification, and chemometric analyses of major constituents of agricultural materials.

DE Winter wheat; Phenology; Early season; Sentinel-2; Mapping
AB Timely and accurate information on winter wheat distribution and planting area is of great significance to food security, policy-making, and ecological function evaluation. However, several problems exist in the traditional winter wheat mapping approaches using remote sensing data, such as the limited spatial resolution of the remote sensing image data, the utilization of full-season remote sensing data, and the heavy dependence on training data. In this context, we propose a method based on the Sentinel-2 time series data with a 10-m spatial resolution to map winter wheat in Shandong, China. This is a novel, easy-to-operate, and effective mapping method, which is called the automated early-season method to map winter wheat using the Sentinel-2 data (AEMMS). The model is based on the assumption that the biomass accumulated by winter crops (mainly consisting of winter wheat and garlic in Shandong province) is gradually increasing and other vegetation is gradually decreasing in the early season phenological window phase. In addition, winter wheat is the crop that accumulates the most biomass among all the winter crops in Shandong province, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value of winter wheat is generally higher than that of garlic. We designe five phenological metrics and a series of classification rules for winter wheat discrimination. The AEMMS method has the following advantages: (1) it achieves high spatial resolution winter wheat mapping with a 10-m spatial resolution; (2) it is an early-season mapping method, which provides winter wheat maps nearly 5 months before harvest; and (3) it is automatic and needs no training sample data. The AEMMS method was applied in Shandong, China, to discriminate winter wheat for the 2017?2018 season. Winter wheat areas were derived in all 17 of the municipal administrative regions of Shandong province, and a strong correlation was observed between the derived winter wheat areas and the official statistics, with the coefficient of determination reaching 0.8973. A high mapping accuracy was also achieved in Jiaxiang County using the AEMMS method, with an overall accuracy of 97.80% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9368.

AB Optical remote sensing is one of the most attractive options for generating crop cover maps because it enables computation of vegetation indices, which are useful for assessing the condition of vegetation. The Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI), which is a multispectral sensor with 13 bands covering the visible, near infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength regions, offers a vast number of vegetation indices. Spectral indices, which are combinations of spectral measurements at different wavelengths, have been used in the previous studies and they sometimes contributed to improve classification accuracies. In this study, 91 published spectral indices were calculated from the MSI data. Additionally, classification algorithms are essential for generating accurate maps and the random forests classifier is one of which possesses the five hyperparameters were applied. The improvements in classification accuracies were confirmed achieving an overall accuracy of 93.1% based on the reflectance at 4 bands and 8 spectral indices.

AB Multispectral sensors constitute a core earth observation imaging technology generating massive high-dimensional observations acquired across multiple time instances. The collected multi-temporal remote sensed data contain rich information for Earth monitoring applications, from flood detection to crop classification. To easily classify such naturally multidimensional data, conventional low-order deep learning models unavoidably toss away valuable information residing across the available dimensions. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art convolutional network models based on the U-Net architecture to their high-dimensional analogs, which can naturally capture multi-dimensional dependencies and correlations. We introduce several model architectures, both of low as well as of high order, and we quantify the achieved classification performance vis-a-vis the latest state-of-the-art methods. The experimental analysis on observations from Landsat-8 reveals that approaches based on low-order U-Net models exhibit poor classification performance and are outperformed by our proposed high-dimensional U-Net scheme.

AB Crop acreage estimation is important for advanced planning and taking various policy decisions. The present study was carried out in Indore district using AWiFS sensor satellite data from sowing to maturity period as well as single date LISS-III sensor satellite data of maximum vegetation growth stage of wheat crop. The technique used for single date LISS-III data classification is complete enumeration approach based on supervised classification. While Multi-date AWiFS data classification technique is based on two-stage classification of multi-date dataset by unsupervised Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). The acreage estimated using the LISS-III sensor data is 98.41 000'ha while using AWiFS sensor data is 105.70 000' ha. It was found that LISS - III results shows -6.89 percent underestimation as compared to AWiFS estimates. The comparison of both (LISS-III and AWiFS) sensor's acreage estimates with the actual acreage data (viz. 97.20 000' ha) shows that higher spatial resolution (LISS-III) sensor satellite data have more accuracy than low spatial resolution (AWiFS) sensor.

AB Sentinel-2 images provide a rich source of information for a variety of land cover, vegetation, and environmental monitoring applications due to their high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. Recently, deep learning-based classification of Sentinel-2 time series becomes a popular solution to vegetation classification and land cover mapping, but it often demands a large number of manually annotated labels. Improving classification performance with limited labeled data is still a challenge in many real-world remote sensing applications. To address label scarcity, we present SITS-Former (SITS stands for Satellite Image Time Series and Former stands for Transformer), a pre-trained representation model for Sentinel-2 time series classification. SITS-Former adopts a Transformer encoder as the backbone and takes time series of image patches as input to learn spatio-spectral-temporal features. According to the principles of self-supervised learning, we pre-train SITS-Former on massive unlabeled Sentinel-2 time series via a missing-data imputation proxy task. Given an incomplete time series with some patches being masked randomly, the network is asked to regress the central pixels of these masked patches based on the residual ones. By doing so, the network can capture high-level spatial and temporal dependencies from the data to learn discriminative features. After pre-training, the network can adapt the learned features to a target classification task through fine-tuning. As far as we know, this is the first study that exploits self-supervised learning for patch-based representation learning and classification of SITS. We quantitatively evaluate the quality of the learned features by transferring them on two crop classification tasks, showing that SITS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and yields a significant improvement (2.64%similar to 3.30% in overall accuracy) over the purely supervised model. The proposed model provides an effective tool for SITS-related applications as it greatly reduces the burden of manual labeling. The source code will be released at htt ps://github.com/linlei1214/SITS-Former upon publication.

AB Optical based remote sensing plays an important role in citrus crop change monitoring in Florida, United States (U.S). However, persistent cloud cover during the summer growing season in Florida often limits the application of optical sensors. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage over optical data by operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover, rain or a lack of illumination. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data for classifying citrus in Florida. Twelve individual citrus classifications produced using single date optical or SAR data, as well as multi-date optical and SAR data fusion, are designed and tested. It is found that the classification accuracies of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data are slightly lower than those of multi-temporal cloud free optical data (approximately 2.5% difference). However, the relatively comparable classification accuracy results indicate that the Sentinel-1 SAR is a useful alternative imagery source particularly in regions with persistent cloud cover.

AB Agricultural production estimate represents a key element in food security analysis, but before the agricultural statistics services process and release the data some precious early warning time is lost. While many remote sensing derived yield estimation methods are used operationally we're still in search of a robust remote sensing based cropped area estimate. ESA-CCI (European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative) released in late 2016 the S2 prototype Land Cover map at 20 m for Africa the first high resolution product of its kind. The objective of the current study is to evaluate how well the 20-m ESA-CCI S2 prototype LC represents cropland; in case the results turn out satisfactory the cropland class could be used as a crop mask that could be used along with yield estimate to assess crop production. The assessment method consisted of (1) selecting six equal size polygons so that the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of West Africa are represented at each of the three basins of the Sahel (Western, Central and Eastern), (2) generating four hundred dots randomly overlaid on the sample polygon (3) using Sentinel 2A 10 m or Google Earth images as ground truth. A dot count is then obtained for each one of the map being assessed and the reference. The process is repeated 10 times bringing the total number of dots used to four thousand for each of the 6 sample polygons. The number of classes is reduced to two (cropland and other). Binary confusion matrices are build and the accuracy, the precision and the sensitivity or recall calculated. Since our main goal is to see how good the classification of cropland is, the analysis focuses on the precision and the recall. Values for both indicators are almost similar for the Sudanian zone, but significantly different for the Sahelian zone, where the higher values of the recall are not an indication of cropland classification performance but rather the result of the relatively small proportion of the actual cropland dots. Therefore, the precision remains here the privileged cropland classification performance indicator. Analysis of the precision indicates that the S2 prototype LC cropland in the Sahelian zone is <3% correct in East Sahel, <7% in West Sahel and about a third of the time correct for the Center Sahelian. This is easily explained by the fact that the S2 prototype LC has mistaken the sand dunes and degraded land that makes up a significant part of the cropland. Even in the Sudanian zone where the analysis shows a better cropland classification performance, the highest precision indicates that the cropland classification is incorrect for a little over 28% of cases. Therefore, the ESA-CCI S2 prototype land cover map can't be used as a crop mask.

AB The hyperspectral remote sensing can detect the more detailed objects on earth surface for its hundreds of wave bands. This make it can be used for very detailed land cover mapping. The study area Yanhe river valley locates on the north west of China, its size of area is 7725 km(2) and length 286.9km. The most objects on the area are vegetations including crops, trees, grasses, and water. For test the real accuracy of mapping with airborne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, parts of the aerial surveying area were investigated and mapped manually during the photographing time. Because of the soil erosion and drought, the land covers are usually mixed especially the crops mixes with grasses, the tree seedling mixes with grasses and withered seedling, some fruit trees mix with crops etc. This is the big challenge of precise land cover mapping with hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. The present work focuses on the detailed vegetation classification problems especially the easy mixed classified objects. From the field investigation, some areas are not covered by single vegetation class but mixtures of multi-species of vegetation. This phenomenon may cause mixed pixel and misclassified problem or even unmixed pixel and right classified but the confused vision in map for the mixed colors in a continuous site of land cover. The general method to solve the mixed pixel problem is the spectral unmixing. But there are some questions in classical unmixing model, one of them is the equation of unmixing model is usually ill-conditioned because of the heavy correlation among hundreds of bands. The research proposed a feature subspace based spectral unmixing model. The unmixing was based on a feature subspace of full data space, the aim is to remove the amount of correlate information and get the right solution of components of endmemeber spectra. The subspace was constructed by principal component analysis(PCA) directions and the easy mixed classes oriented projection pursuit (PP) directions. For the unmixing model, the research discussed the results of unconstrained and constrained solutions. Based on the unmixing results, the land cover map was achieved and the accuracy was verified.

AB Cotton is the most important fibre culture in the world. In Brazil, cotton cultivation is concentrated in the Cerrado biome, the Brazilian savanna, and is one of the most important commodities in the country. As an annual crop, the updating frequency of the spatial distribution data of cotton fields is extremely important for crop monitoring systems. In order to provide fast and accurate information for crop monitoring, time series of remote- sensing data has been used in the development of several applications in agriculture, since the high temporal resolution of some orbital sensor allows monitoring targets with high spectral-temporal variations in the land surface. However, there are still some challenges to systematize the processing of such a large amount of data available by long time series of remote-sensing imagery. Thus, this study contributes to the construction of models to identify and separate specific crop types with similar spectral behaviour to other crops practised in the same period. The objective of this study was to develop a systematic methodology based on data mining of time series of vegetation indices (VI) to map cotton fields at the regional scale. Field reference data and time series of NDVI and EVI images, obtained from MODIS sensor products during four cropping seasons (from 2012-2013 to 2015-2016), were used to construct mapping models based on decision tree algorithms. Phenological metrics were calculated from the VI time series and used to build classification rules for mapping cotton fields. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method to map cotton fields achieve high accuracy when field data and visual interpretation of NDVI temporal profiles were used for validation (accuracy higher than 95% and 93%, respectively). Comparisons with the official statistics indicated an optimal fit, with linear correlation (r) and coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.93. Therefore, the proposed method was efficient to distinguish cotton fields from other crop types with similar spectral behaviour. In addition, this method can also be applied to other cotton-producing regions and other production seasons, by reusing the models generated through machine learning approaches.

AB Advancements in efficient unmanned aerial platforms and affordable sensors has led to renewed interest in remote sensing by agricultural producers and land managers for use as an efficient and convenient method of evaluating crop status and pest issues in their fields. For remote sensing to be employed as a viable and widespread tool for weed management, the accurate detection of distinct weed species must be possible through the use of analytical procedures on the resultant imagery. Additionally, the remote sensing platform and subsequent analysis must be capable of identifying these species across a wide range of heights. In 2017, a field study was performed to identify any weed height thresholds on the accurate detection and subsequent classification of three common broadleaf weed species in the southeastern United States: Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and sicklepod Senna obtusifolia) as well as the classification accuracy of image classifications performed on the species scale. Pots of the three species at heights of 5, 10, 15, and 30 cm were randomly arranged in a grid and 5-band multispectral imagery was collected at 15 m. Image analysis was used to identify the spectral reflectance behavior of the weed species and height combinations and to evaluate the accuracy of species based supervised classifications involving the three species. Supervised classification was able to discriminate between the three weed species with between 24-100% accuracy depending on height and species. Palmer amaranth classification accuracy was consistently 100%. Increased height of sicklepod and common ragweed plants did not reliably confer improved accuracy but the species were correctly identified with at least 24% and 60% accuracy, respectively.
   Spectral separation was found to be dependent on the species, band, and height being observed. Reflectance of the species in bands 1, 2, 4, and 5 increased with height while band 3 reflectance declined as weed height increased. No clear pattern was observed with respect to species and height on relative reflectance intensity within any waveband and appears to instead depend on the species and height being observed at a particular imaging date. Finally, spectral separation was found to exist between the species, demonstrating the potential for using spectral reflectance measurements to discriminate between them, particularly in bands 3 and 4. Despite spectral separation between weed species, no clear trends with respect to weed height or waveband were discovered.

AB Efficient, more accurate reporting of maize (Zea mays L.) phenology, crop condition, and progress is crucial for agronomists and policy makers. Integration of satellite imagery with machine learning models has shown great potential to improve crop classification and facilitate in-season phenological reports. However, crop phenology classification precision must be substantially improved to transform data into actionable management decisions for farmers and agronomists. An integrated approach utilizing ground truth field data for maize crop phenology (2013-2018 seasons), satellite imagery (Landsat 8), and weather data was explored with the following objectives: (i) model training and validation-identify the best combination of spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), weather parameters, geolocation, and ground truth data, resulting in a model with the highest accuracy across years at each season segment (step one) and (ii) model testing-post-selection model performance evaluation for each phenology class with unseen data (hold-out cross-validation) (step two). The best model performance for classifying maize phenology was documented when VIs (NDVI, EVI, GCVI, NDWI, GVMI) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were used as input variables. This study supports the integration of field ground truth, satellite imagery, and weather data to classify maize crop phenology, thereby facilitating foundational decision making and agricultural interventions for the different members of the agricultural chain.

AB Landsat TM thermal bands have generally not been used for land-use classification because of their inferior spatial resolution. But thermal band data is potentially useful, highlighting reductions in temperature associated with recent irrigation, and between the different stages of growth of the crops. This paper presents the results of a remote sensing study for land use classification, based upon Landsat 7 ETM+ data, aimed at estimating irrigation water demand on the basis of the areas cultivated with different types of crops, and local irrigation practices. A time series of images has been acquired for an area along the Syr Darya River (Kazakhstan), one of the two major rivers feeding the Aral Sea. Once the fourth largest inland sea in surface area in the world, the Aral Sea has been reduced to less than 20% of its original volume as a result of large-scale irrigation, causing extensive environmental damage. A rational method of managing irrigation is urgently required if the sea is to return to its former condition. This paper explores the use of the Landsat ETM+ thermal bands alongside those more commonly used for agricultural land classification. Strategies for determining irrigation water demand are discussed, and observations are compared with ground truth.

AB The coconut tree is an important cash crop in coastal tropical regions. These trees undergo substantial damage during annual cyclones. Early and effective assessment of damage is important to farmers for appropriate monetary compensation. However, the identification of coconut trees presents multiple challenges: (i) the trees are with other vegetation and (ii) cloud cover during monsoons and cyclones precludes using simple imaging techniques. Although automated approaches based on classical machine learning techniques have been attempted for other crops on remote sensed images, these are not adequate for identifying coconut trees from different land cover. We present a hybrid approach termed CocoNet that combines (i) unsupervised K-means for pixel-based coarse classification of land cover and (ii) a patch- based convolutional neural network for fine classification of vegetation to identify coconut farms. The challenge presented by cloud cover is addressed using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Change detection is then performed on bitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR images taken before and after a cyclone to obtain the change map depicting the damage caused. Experimental results show that the proposed two-phase CocoNet model gives a classification accuracy of 92.5% and a change detection accuracy of 89.1%.

Geographic Information System (GIS) is a major tool for monitoring and forecasting the rice production in the region to minimize the risk of unsuitable crop conditions. The study area focuses on the central of Thailand where higher rice production with two crops annually thanks to the irrigation water available in the region. The Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) is the government organization for publishing statistical data on Thai agriculture. But the data is updated until the year after while water management and rice market price are required updated and near real-time data. Remote sensing is an updated data source and free of charge information that could be applied to solve this problem. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data is applied to classify rice crops for both major and second crops. The results of the classification are then compared to the OAE statistics data for accuracy assessment. The rice crop areas are calculated and its attribute data includes growing stages as a major and second crop with its productivity estimation.

AB Fine land cover classification in an open pit mining area (LCCOM) is essential in analyzing the terrestrial environment. However, researchers have been focusing on obtaining coarse LCCOM while using high spatial resolution remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. Although support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully used in the remote sensing community, achieving a high classification accuracy of fine LCCOM using SVM remains difficult because of two factors. One is the lack of significant features for efficiently describing unique terrestrial characteristics of open pit mining areas and another is the lack of an optimized strategy to obtain suitable SVM parameters. This study attempted to address these two issues. Firstly, a novel carbonate index that was based on WorldView-3 was proposed and introduced into the used feature set. Additionally, three optimization methods-genetic algorithm (GA), k-fold cross validation (CV), and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-were used for obtaining the optimization parameters of SVM. The results show that the carbonate index was effective for distinguishing the dumping ground from other open pit mining lands. Furthermore, the three optimization methods could significantly increase the overall classification accuracy (OA) of the fine LCCOM by 8.40%. CV significantly outperformed GA and PSO, and GA performed slightly better than PSO. CV was more suitable for most of the fine land cover types of crop land, and PSO for road and open pit mining lands. The results of an independent test set revealed that the optimized SVM models achieved significant improvements, with an average of 8.29%. Overall, the proposed strategy was effective for fine LCCOM.

AB Crop maps are essential inputs for the agricultural planning done at various governmental and agribusinesses agencies. Remote sensing offers timely and costs efficient technologies to identify and map crop types over large areas. Among the plethora of classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are widely used because of their proven performance. In this work, we study the synergic use of both methods by introducing a random forest kernel (RFK) in a SVM classifier. A time series of multispectral WorldView-2 images acquired over Mali (West Africa) in 2014 was used to develop our case study. Ground truth containing five common crop classes (cotton, maize, millet, peanut, and sorghum) were collected at 45 farms and used to train and test the classifiers. A SVM with the standard Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, a RF, and a SVM-RFK were trained and tested over 10 random training and test subsets generated from the ground data. Results show that the newly proposed SVM-RFK classifier can compete with both RF and SVM-RBF. The overall accuracies based on the spectral bands only are of 83, 82 and 83% respectively. Adding vegetation indices to the analysis result in the classification accuracy of 82, 81 and 84% for SVM-RFK, RF, and SVM-RBF respectively. Overall, it can be observed that the newly tested RFK can compete with SVM-RBF and RF classifiers in terms of classification accuracy.

AB This article explores the potential use of remote sensing to discriminate two grass-weeds (Avena sterilis and Lolium rigidum) from four cultivars (cvs) of winter wheat and barley. Hyperspectral measurements, using a GER2600 spectroradiometer (350 to 2500 nm), were conducted throughout the life cycle of the plants in order to analyse spectral differences between weeds and crops at different phenological stages. Specific techniques for hyperspectral data, such as the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) were used to quantify the spectral separability between weeds and crops, while stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to detect those wavelengths providing the best discrimination ability. SAM results showed that spectral differences were generally insufficient to discriminate weeds and crops. Only during the first phenological stages were angular distances large enough to achieve a good classification of the different species. This behaviour was related to the different fraction cover of crops and weeds in this period. The wavebands that provide the best discrimination ability according to the discriminant analysis were pooled in eight spectral regions in order to determine their frequency of occurrence. The four most frequently selected spectral regions were the Far Short-Wave Infrared, Early Short-Wave Infrared, Blue and the Red Edge.

AB IRS1D-LISS-III imagery (FCC) was visually interpreted to identify land use categories and land suitability analysis for important crops of the study area, viz., maize and wheat was performed based on the limitation concept of the FAO methodology for land evaluation combined with parametric classification approach and Multiple overlaying techniques in a GIS environment. The suitability analysis for wheat crop showed that 37, 13, and 50 per cent of the total area of the watershed is moderately suitable, marginally Suitable and permanently unsuitable, respectively. With respect to maize crop, 0.7 per cent is found to be highly Suitable, 36.6 per cent is moderately Suitable, 13 per cent is currently unsuitable, and 50 pet, cent is permanently unsuitable. Major limitations of the watershed are found to be low soil fertility, low water holding capacity of soils, erosion hazard on steep slope land units, and inadequate water availability during the intermediate growing period. The study also showed that GIS and Remote sensing techniques are powerful tools to integrate various data layers and to assess the potentials and limitations of physical land resources for scientific land use planning and decision supporting systems in crop specific modeling of agricultural production.

AB Long period data and information indicate that India faced number of droughts-like situation from colonial period. A number of indices have been developed nationally and internationally to monitor agricultural drought based on remote sensing; however, to predict the onset of agricultural drought and its evolution and monitoring in time and space in a more efficient way qualitatively, Combined Drought Index (CDI) has been developed using meteorological, land based and remote sensing observations. In this study, an effort has been made to monitor agricultural drought based on exploitation of new data, methodologies and metrics that would aid the experts to make best judgments of regional-scale drought conditions through CDI using geospatial technology. The present study has been carried out for three consecutive years of 2014, 2015 and 2016 in five states (Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Telangana) in India at district level for southwest monsoon season when rainfed kharif crops are grown extensively across the above-mentioned states in India. CDI gives a synthetic and synoptic overview of the drought situations using a classification scheme derived from various individual indices as it has been developed to combine the strength of various indices.

AB Cropping patterns are closely related to food production, cropland intensification, water resource management, greenhouse gas emission and regional climate alteration. Timely and accurate mapping of cropping patterns is urgently needed in many disciplines. However, the existing cropland-related datasets are informative at the global level, but lack regional-scale details about cropland utilizations. Thus, there is a need for better information on the area and distribution of cropping patterns at regional scales. In this study, we developed a phenology-based cropping pattern (PBCP) mapping method based on remote sensing vegetation index time series. The new method first extracted vegetation phenological metrics (start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), growing season length (GSL) and growth amplitude (GA)) from the vegetation index time series. Then, it identified crop seasons by using the minimum crop GSL, the minimum crop GA and the maximum crop GSL, which were derived from the training samples. Finally, cropping patterns were classified based on a set of decision rules. The case study in Henan province of China showed that, the results indicated that: (1) compared with cropping index derived from the supervised classification of Landsat-5 TM images, the PBCP method provided cropping index with satisfactory accuracy of 85.3%. (2) Validation sample analysis indicated that the cropping pattern mapping accuracy was 84% for the PBCP method. Different to current cropping pattern mapping methods, the PBCP method considered crop planting information in three years in deciding the cropping pattern to map the dominant cropping patterns. It can provide new insights in agriculture related land use analysis.

AB Accurate and timely spatial classification of crop types based on remote sensing data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.

AB Accurate and timely mapping of crop types and having reliable information about the cultivation pattern/area play a key role in various applications, including food security and sustainable agriculture management. Remote sensing (RS) has extensively been employed for crop type classification. However, accurate mapping of crop types and extents is still a challenge, especially using traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, in this study, a novel framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a dual attention module (DAM) and using Sentinel-2 time-series datasets was proposed to classify crops. A new DAM was implemented to extract informative deep features by taking advantage of both spectral and spatial characteristics of Sentinel-2 datasets. The spectral and spatial attention modules (AMs) were respectively applied to investigate the behavior of crops during the growing season and their neighborhood properties (e.g., textural characteristics and spatial relation to surrounding crops). The proposed network contained two streams: (1) convolution blocks for deep feature extraction and (2) several DAMs, which were employed after each convolution block. The first stream included three multi-scale residual convolution blocks, where the spectral attention blocks were mainly applied to extract deep spectral features. The second stream was built using four multi-scale convolution blocks with a spatial AM. In this study, over 200,000 samples from six different crop types (i.e., alfalfa, broad bean, wheat, barley, canola, and garden) and three non-crop classes (i.e., built-up, barren, and water) were collected to train and validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 98.54% and 0.981, respectively. It also outperformed other state-of-the-art classification methods, including RF, XGBOOST, R-CNN, 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, and CBAM, indicating its high potential to discriminate different crop types.

ID AERIAL IMAGES
AB In the remote sensing community, land-cover classification is usually performed on the top-view images. However, besides the top-view features (including elevation), facade captured by the oblique images is useful but severely underutilized in the land-cover classification. The facade information of an object, is by nature more variable, thus can be extremely useful when the extracted features are used for land-cover classification. Hence, in this paper, we try to explore the use of facade from the oblique images to enhance the accuracy of land-cover classification. Firstly, we locate the facades by finding the elevation changes and the corresponding above-ground objects. Then, the facade images are cropped from oblique images and the color and Haar-like features are extracted as facade features. Finally, following the object-based land-cover classification, super-pixels are generated and used as the basic unit for the feature extraction and classification. Experiments are performed on five representative site using five-head oblique aerial images and their derived orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM). The results show that with the facade information, the classification performances have been steadily improved, especially for the buildings which has around 10% improvement.

AB The Hyperspectral Image Analysis Toolbox (HIAT) is a collection of algorithms that extend the capability of the MATLAB numerical computing environment for the processing of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery. The purpose the Toolbox is to provide a suite of information extraction algorithms to users of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery. HIAT has been developed as part of the NSF Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging (CenSSIS) Solutionware that seeks to develop a repository of reliable and reusable software tools that can be shared by researchers across research domains. HIAT provides easy access to feature extraction/selection, supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms, unmixing and visualization developed at Laboratory of Remote Sensing and Image Processing (LARSIP). This paper presents an overview of the tools, application available in HIAT using as example an AVIRIS image. In addition, we present the new HIAT developments, unmixing, new oversampling algorithm, true color visualization, crop tool and GUI enhancement.

AB Crop mapping and time series analysis of agronomic cycles are critical for monitoring land use and land management practices, and analysing the issues of agro-environmental impacts and climate change. Multi-temporal Landsat data can be used to analyse decadal changes in cropping patterns at field level, owing to its medium spatial resolution and historical availability. This study attempts to develop robust remote sensing techniques, applicable across a large geographic extent, for state-wide mapping of cropping history in Queensland, Australia. In this context, traditional pixel-based classification was analysed in comparison with image object-based classification using advanced supervised machine-learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   For the Darling Downs region of southern Queensland we gathered a set of Landsat TM images from the 2010-2011 cropping season. Landsat data, along with the vegetation index images, were subjected to multiresolution segmentation to obtain polygon objects. Object-based methods enabled the analysis of aggregated sets of pixels, and exploited shape-related and textural variation, as well as spectral characteristics. SVM models were chosen after examining three shape-based parameters, twenty-three textural parameters and ten spectral parameters of the objects.
   We found that the object-based methods were superior to the pixel-based methods for classifying 4 major landuse/land cover classes, considering the complexities of within field spectral heterogeneity and spectral mixing. Comparative analysis clearly revealed that higher overall classification accuracy (95%) was observed in the object-based SVM compared with that of traditional pixel-based classification (89%) using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Object-based classification also resulted speckle-free images. Further, object-based SVM models were used to classify different broadacre crop types for summer and winter seasons. The influence of different shape, textural and spectral variables, and their weights on crop-mapping accuracy, was also examined. Temporal change in the spectral characteristics, specifically through vegetation indices derived from multi-temporal Landsat data, was found to be the most critical information that affects the accuracy of classification. However, use of these variables was constrained by the data availability and cloud cover.

AB Crop residue (or plant litter) on the soil surface can decrease soil erosion and runoff and improve soil quality. Quantification of crop residue cover is required to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation tillage practices as well as the extent of biofuel harvesting. Remote sensing techniques can provide reliable assessment od crop residue cover over large fields. With Landsat Thematic Mapper bands, crop residues can be brighter or darker than soils depending on soil type, crop type, moisture content, and residue age. With hyperspectral reflectance data, relatively narrow absorption features, centered near 2100 and 2300 nm, can be detected that are associated with cellulose and lignin concentrations. These features are evident in reflectance spectra of crop residues, but not in reflectance spectra of soils. Our objectives were to: (1) estimate crop residue cover using remotely sensed data over an agricultural site in central Iowa, and (2) evaluate alternative, less labor-intensive sampling schemes for acquiring crop residue cover surface reference data.
   We acquired EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data over agricultural fields in central Iowa shortly after planting in May 2004 and 2005. Crop residue cover was also measured in corn and soybean fields using line-point transects. The cellulose absorption index (CAI), which measured the relative intensity of the absorption feature near 2100 nm, was calculated using three relatively narrow bands centered at 2030, 2100, and 2210 nm. Results showed that crop residue cover was linearly related to CAI. Changes in the slopes of the regression line from year to year were related to scene moisture conditions. Tillage intensity classes corresponding to conventional tillage (<= 30% cover) and conservation tillage (> 30% cover) were correctly identified in 75-82% of the fields. In addition, by combining information from previous season's crop classification with crop residue cover after planting, an inventory of soil tillage intensity by previous crop was generated for the whole Hyperion scene for each year. Inventories and maps of tillage intensity are required for field-and watershed scale models to evaluate management practices that maximize production and minimize environmental impact.

AB Hyperspectral image (HI) analysis is becoming popular in remote sensing applications due to its high spectral resolution along with high spatial resolution compared to a Multispectral image. Classification of pixel vectors in a hyperspectral image (HI) to their respective classes is challenging. HI classification is an elementary task for land cover mapping, mineral exploitation, precision agriculture, etc. Optimal parameters are required to reduce the losses in the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and provide the most accurate results possible. Studies in this regard, so far have been made with manual selection of optimal parameters using traditional trial-and-error methods like the selection of loss function, a number of convolution filters, optimizer function, etc., and found to be strenuous and time-consuming. To alleviate these challenges of selecting the hyperparameters and observing the accuracy until a competitive value is reached, this paper uses a novel mechanism to classify Hyperspectral Images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) where the 6-hyperparameters of CNN are optimized with Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The proposed GWO-based-CNN-HI model exhibits better classification accuracy (99.95%, 99.96%, and 99.99%) on three benchmark HI datasets in comparison to traditional models. Thus the novel GWO-based-CNN-HI model finds its suitability in applications of land cover classification, crop stage detection, specially in remote applications with limited computing power.

AB In the semi-arid areas of Petrolina municipality, Northeast Brazil, irrigated agriculture has replaced the natural vegetation, thus the quantification of the energy exchanges between the plants and the low atmosphere is important. MODIS satellite images and agro-meteorological data for the years of 2010 and 2011 were used together, for modelling the energy balance components under these conditions. Surface albedo (alpha(0)), NDVI and surface temperature (T-0) were the remote sensing parameters required to calculate the latent heat flux (lambda E) and the surface resistance to evapotranspiration (r(s)) on a large scale. The daily net radiation (R-n) was retrieved from alpha(0), air temperature (T-a) and transmissivity (tau(sw)), allowing the quantification of the sensible heat flux (H) by residual in the energy balance. With threshold values for r(s), it was possible to do a simplified vegetation classification. The incident solar radiation (RS down arrow) partitioned as R-n ranged from 0.40 to 0.51, corresponding respectively to periods after the rainy season and the driest conditions of the year, with the observed differences between irrigated crops and natural ecosystem not significant. Considering all periods along the year, the averaged fractions of R-n partitioned as H, were 31 and 78%, for irrigated crops and natural vegetation, respectively, while as lambda E the corresponding ratios were 69 and 22%. Heat advection from the dry areas surrounding irrigated plots was observed with lambda E exceeding R-n by 9% during the coldest periods. The models tested herein can be used for monitoring the energy exchanges in agro-ecosystems under conditions of land use and climate change.

AB Timely and accurate information on crop conditions obtained during the growing season is of vital importance for crop management. High spatial resolution satellite imagery has the potential for mapping crop growth variability and identifying problem areas within fields. The objectives of this study were to use QuickBird satellite imagery for mapping plant growth and yield patterns within grain sorghum fields as compared with airborne multispectral image data. A QuickBird 2.8-m four-band image covering a cropping area in south Texas, USA was acquired in the 2003 growing season. Airborne three-band imagery with submeter resolution was also collected from two grain sorghum fields within the satellite scene. Yield monitor data collected from the two fields were resampled to match the resolutions of the airborne imagery and the satellite imagery. The airborne imagery was related to yield at original submeter, 2.8 and 8.4 m resolutions and the QuickBird imagery was related to yield at 2.8 and 8.4 m resolutions. The extracted QuickBird images for the two fields were then classified into multiple zones using unsupervised classification and mean yields among the zones were compared. Results showed that grain yield was significantly related to both types of image data and that the QuickBird imagery had similar correlations with grain yield as compared with the airborne imagery at the 2.8 and 8.4 m resolutions. Moreover, the unsupervised classification maps effectively differentiated grain production levels among the zones. These results indicate that high spatial resolution satellite imagery can be a useful data source for determining plant growth and yield patterns for within-field crop management.

AB This paper is a first attempt to compute the total water needs of an agricultural plain with remote sensing and ground data in Iran. The cropping areas were mapped with Sentinels-2 images, based on NDVI profiles classification. This model was validated and 85% of the areas were correctly classified. Second, the crop water needs were computed using PYSEBAL and Landsat-8 images. Crop evapotranspiration (ETseason) and Irrigation Requirements (IRseason) were calculated for each crop and then validated by comparing IR collected in the field from farmers with computed IRPYSEBAL on 5 plots. IRPYSEBAL underestimated the reality with an average of 10% while the overestimation average was 17%. The second validation was the comparison of Daily ET from FAO-56 method and Daily ET PYSEBAL showed a RMSE of 0.67 mm/day and MAE of 0.52 mm/day, which assesses the accuracy of PYSEBAL. ETseason varies according to weather parameters in the plain and IRseason according to different irrigation practices. The most water demanding crops were identified: rice (IR: 1427 mm) and corn (669). The total water balance of Marvdasht was negative in 2018 with 0.2859 km(3) of extracted groundwater for irrigation for only 0.098 km(3) of available water for aquifers recharge.

AB Nowadays, optical and radar remote sensing data are increasingly used for land-cover/vegetation mapping and monitoring. Their technical capabilities and tools are improving all the time and provide more accurate results. By the recent arrival of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 series, available free, processing and methods of analysis must be increased more and more in the field of cartography. This paper aims to present vegetation mapping method in the Pays de Brest area by using a time series stacking of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 satellites data using the algorithm Random Forest supervised classification. The types of vegetation mapping in first time are those belonging to the major vegetation types, but especially those that can be observed on the processed images that are the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 series and SPOT-6. The types of classes considered for this study are: no vegetation, forest and undergrowth, moors and lawns, summer crops, winter crops, grassland and water. Several time series stacking has been made on that series containing 140 images radar representing different dates (2017) and the best combination method is to use both the two polarizations VV and VH to the calculation of the matrix of confusion. On the other hand, combinations of SAR images with different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, S2rep, IRECI) calculated from the Images Sentinel-2 have been made. The series of times series stacking ends with combinations between SPOT-6 and Sentinel-1. The times series stacking Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 are satisfactory, with an overall accuracy that reaches 93%. Such precision is very good for data that are available free.

AB Water deficit stress is one of the most important growth limiting factors in crop production. Several methods have been used to detect and evaluate the effects of water deficit on plants. In the present study, remote sensing has been used. The objectives were to 1) determine the effects of water deficit on greenhouse crop using spectral indices and 2) evaluate the reflectance spectra using the classification tree method for distinguishing water deficit levels based on substrate water content. For this reason, tomato plants were grown in slabs filled with perlite: i) under no irrigation for five days and ii) continuously well-watered. A hyperspectral camera was used to remotely measure plant reflectance during the periods with normal or low substrate water content. A large number of vegetation and water indices were compiled in order to measure plant vigour and other biophysical parameters using the remotely sensed data. A significant correlation was found between the mrNDVI reflectance index and substrate water content (0). In addition, the PRI values observed for plants of the water deficit treatment varied, once 0% rapidly decreased to 4.5%. The daily mean TCARI was linearly correlated with chlorophyll content but not with 0% variations. A classification tree was developed to investigate the relationship between the categorical data and determine the variables affecting other independent variables. The decision tree methodology could be used to build the model for the prediction of irrigation event outcomes.

AB Land-cover geodatabases are key products for the understanding of environmental systems and for setting up national and international prevention and protection policies. However, their automatic generation and update remain complicated with high accuracy over large scales. In natural environments, most of the existing solutions are semi-automatic in order to achieve a suitable discrimation of the large number of forest and crop classes. A large amount of remote sensing possibilities is at the moment available and data fusion appears to be the most suitable solution for that purpose. The paper tackles the issue of land-cover mapping in such areas assuming the existence of a partly non-updated 5-class geodatabase: buildings, roads, water, crops, forests. Lidar point clouds and Radar images at two spatial resolutions and bands are merged at the feature level and fed into an efficient supervised classification framework. Results show that some classes benefit from the joint exploitation of multiple observations in terms of accuracy or recall.

AB Frequent freezing injury greatly influences winter wheat production; thus, effective prevention and a command of agricultural production are vital. The freezing injury monitoring method integrated with '3S' (geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning system (GPS) and remote sensing (RS)) technology has an unparalleled advantage. Using HuanJing (HJ)-1A/1B satellite images of a winter wheat field in Shanxi Province, China plus a field survey, crop types and winter wheat planting area were identified through repeated visual interpretations of image information and spatial analyses conducted in GIS. Six vegetation indices were extracted from processed HJ-1A/1B satellite images to determine whether the winter wheat suffered from freezing injury and its degree of severity and recovery, using change vector analysis (CVA), the freeze injury representative vegetation index and the combination of the two methods, respectively. Accuracy of the freezing damage classification results was verified by determining the impact of freezing damage on yield and quantitative analysis. The CVA and the change of normalized difference vegetation index (Delta NDVI) monitoring results were different so a comprehensive analysis of the combination of CVA and Delta NDVI was performed. The area with serious freezing injury covered 0.9% of the total study area, followed by the area of no freezing injury (3.5%), moderate freezing injury (10.2%) and light freezing injury (85.4%). Of the moderate and serious freezing injury areas, 0.2% did not recover; 1.2% of the no freezing injury and light freezing injury areas showed optimal recovery, 15.6% of the light freezing injury and moderate freezing injury areas showed poor recovery, and the remaining areas exhibited general recovery.

AB Population growth, urban expansion, and land degradation may place plant natural resources for tool and agriculture at risk. Crop acreage monitoring is basic information necessary for wise management of these resources. Recent developments in remote sensing technologies have created promising opportunities for improving agricultural statistics systems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is one detector board on Terra's (EOS-AM1), which was lunched on December 18, 1999 by NASA. It offers a unique combination of spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution compared to previous global sensors, making it a good candidate for large-scale crop acreage estimating. However, because of subpixel heterogeneity, the application of traditional hard classification approaches to MODIS data may result in significant errors in crop area estimation, especially in China. This paper describes the application of an ANN (artificial neural network) classifier to differentiate different crops. A classic multilayer feed-forward neural network with back propagation algorithm was used throughout the experiment. In the experiment the model responds to subpixel class composition in MODIS data in Henan province of China. The approach with MODIS data that estimates subpixel fractions of crop area based on the temporal signature of reflectance throughout the growing season. In the experiment a zone that can get LANDSAT/TM data was chosen to be train dataset in the ANN. The paper assumes that the crop area estimating from LANDSAT/TM data is correct; in the training set the crop area based on MODIS data can get from the classification result of LANDSAT/TM data. After the complication of training ANN, we can estimate the entire crop area based on the MODIS data in Henan province. Comparing to national statistic data, the relative error of winter wheat's planting acreage is 4.2% in Henan province of China in 2002.

AB Combining information from different sources is an important practical problem in survey sampling. Using a hierarchical area-level model, we establish a framework to integrate auxiliary information to improve state-level area estimates. The best predictors are obtained by the conditional expectations of latent variables given observations, and an estimate of the mean squared prediction error is discussed. Sponsored by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the US Department of Agriculture, the proposed model is applied to the planted crop acreage estimation problem by combining information from three sources, including the June Area Survey obtained by a probability-based sampling of lands, administrative data about the planted acreage and the cropland data layer, which is a commodity-specific classification product derived from remote sensing data. The proposed model combines the available information at a sub-state level called the agricultural statistics district and aggregates to improve state-level estimates of planted acreages for different crops. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

ID CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; LAND-COVER; PROBABILITIES; IMAGERY
AB Uncertainty is an inherent issue in all thematic maps, including those produced from remote sensing (RS) data. Factors such as the characteristics of the imagery used to obtain the map or the classification methods, among others, can contribute to differences in the level of uncertainty. Given that map accuracy is not spatially uniform and that confusion matrices do not resolve the issue, this paper proposes a methodology to visualize the spatial uncertainty of a crop map obtained through RS and enriched at parcel scale. The final map covers an area of 3323 ha represented at a scale of 1: 35,000. The estimator used to show the classification uncertainty is 'purity', that is, the percentage of each parcel area occupied by the finally assigned category. This value is an indicator of misclassification probability analyzed at parcel scale, which is a more useful measure in real management than are per pixel approaches.

AB In this paper we present a methodology for the estimation of water abstraction due to irrigation, using MERIS and Landsat remote sensing data to obtain irrigated surfaces.
   Surfaces obtained from Landsat imagery come from a supervised classification. On the contrary, from the processing of a mutitemporal set of MERIS imagery biophysical parameters of green cover fraction and heterogeneity of green cover vegetation are retrieved. From these and by means of the inversion of models of reflectance and crop phenological cycle, acreage maps are obtained, considering one crop at a time per aggregation unit.
   Water heights and volumes are calculated using FAO methodology adapted to local conditions. The work is carried out under GMES initiative and aims to study technical and economic feasibility of the methodology in order to provide an aid decision tool for Administrations to do their monitoring and reporting towards the Water Framework Directive (WFD).

AB With the continuous and rapid rise of urbanization in China, land use transition research has been carried out extensively. Multiple cropping is the content of land use recessive morphology research, and it is also a common agricultural system in China. Accordingly, further research on multiple cropping index (MCI) can enrich the land use transition research and help to evaluate China's food security. In order to examine the spatiotemporal changes and factors influencing the MCI of cultivated land in China, we collected MODIS remote sensing image data and land use classification data and conducted a remote sensing inversion on China's MCI from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The spatial distributions and evolution processes of the MCI were explored through spatial mapping, statistical analysis, and processing with the Geographic Information System; moreover, the influencing factors of MCI were explored quantitatively with principal component regression. The results were as follows: (1) at the provincial scale, the average MCI across Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu was high; meanwhile, the average MCI across Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Qinghai was low. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of provinces with low MCI increased gradually, and the average MCI decreased greatly in the southern provinces. (2) At the county scale, the Taihang Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and Hengduan Mountains formed the boundary of China's single cropping and multiple cropping indices. Dynamic changes in China's MCI were obvious, and the number of counties with MCI change values lower than 0 increased gradually. Last, (3) natural conditions, nonagricultural process, cultivated land quality, and agricultural intensification demonstrated different degrees of impact on the MCI; in particular, the influence of nonagricultural industries, pesticides, and agricultural plastic film on the MCI proved especially important. Future research should strengthen the existing work on related transformations in farmers' livelihoods, especially in terms of the return of rural labor force, the body of agricultural production, agricultural ecological issues, and the balance between increased crop production and reduced environmental pollution. In addition, agricultural policy design should pay more attention to cultivated land quality, the farmer who cultivates the land, and the multiple cropping potential of cultivated land.

DE Watermarking; spread spectrum; image quality; robustness;
   classification; discrete cosine transform
ID TRANSFORM
AB Watermarking represents a potentially effective tool for the protection and verification of ownership rights in remotely sensed imagery. Such data however cannot undergo critical quality degradation processes, for they must ensure accurate extraction of thematic and scientific information. In this paper, we propose to adapt a state-of-the-art spread spectrum method found to be particularly powerful for real world images to make the watermark insertion process near-lossless while preserving most of its effective robustness capability. This is done by embedding the watermark in the middle-frequency range of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain instead of the low-frequency range. The exact position is determined by a numerical root-finding method, targeted to achieve a user-specified minimum level of robustness against a given ensemble of attacks. In this way, an optimal trade-off can be obtained between quality and robustness. Thorough experimental tests over a multispectral remote sensing image show that the proposed method allows to trade a contained loss in robustness with a significant gain in image quality, quantified in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and impact on classification performance. In addition, they reveal an interesting property of the watermark insertion shifting into the middle-frequency range, consisting of a sharp increase in robustness to the widely used cropping operation, which is considered the most critical attack in remote sensing imagery.

AB Real-time monitoring of agricultural crops is an important exercise because of the huge economic impact. Identification of crop during early stage of the crop cycle can help formulate better agriculture policies and management strategies. In this context, the objective of this article is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery in crop identification for an Indian region. A multi-class classification algorithm based on random forest is applied to the features extracted from the above mentioned satellite data sets. Initial experimental suggest that the Sentinel-1 SAR data is promising in achieving high classification accuracy (85%).

AB Cropping systems information on explicit scales is an important but rarely available variable in many crops modeling routines and of utmost importance for understanding pests and disease propagation mechanisms in agro-ecological landscapes. In this study, high spatial and temporal resolution RapidEye bio-temporal data were utilized within a novel 2-step hierarchical random forest (RF) classification approach to map areas of mono- and mixed maize cropping systems. A small-scale maize farming site in Machakos County, Kenya was used as a study site. Within the study site, field data was collected during the satellite acquisition period on general land use/land cover (LULC) and the two cropping systems. Firstly, non-cropland areas were masked out from other land use/land cover using the LULC mapping result. Subsequently an optimized RF model was applied to the cropland layer to map the two cropping systems (2nd classification step). An overall accuracy of 93% was attained for the LULC classification, while the class accuracies (PA: producer's accuracy and UA: user's accuracy) for the two cropping systems were consistently above 85%. We concluded that explicit mapping of different cropping systems is feasible in complex and highly fragmented agro-ecological landscapes if high resolution and multi-temporal satellite data such as 5 m RapidEye data is employed. Further research is needed on the feasibility of using freely available 10-20 m Sentinel-2 data for wide-area assessment of cropping systems as an important variable in numerous crop productivity models.

AB Crop mapping in West Africa is challenging, due to the unavailability of adequate satellite images (as a result of excessive cloud cover), small agricultural fields and a heterogeneous landscape. To address this challenge, we integrated high spatial resolution multi-temporal optical (RapidEye) and dual polarized (VV/VH) SAR (TerraSAR-X) data to map crops and crop groups in northwestern Benin using the random forest classification algorithm. The overall goal was to ascertain the contribution of the SAR data to crop mapping in the region. A per-pixel classification result was overlaid with vector field boundaries derived from image segmentation, and a crop type was determined for each field based on the modal class within the field. A per-field accuracy assessment was conducted by comparing the final classification result with reference data derived from a field campaign. Results indicate that the integration of RapidEye and TerraSAR-X data improved classification accuracy by 10%-15% over the use of RapidEye only. The VV polarization was found to better discriminate crop types than the VH polarization. The research has shown that if optical and SAR data are available for the whole cropping season, classification accuracies of up to 75% are achievable.

AB Due to its special imaging characteristics, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has become an important source of information for a variety of remote sensing applications dealing with environmental changes. SAR images contain information about both phase and intensity in different polarization modes, making them sensitive to geometrical structure and physical properties of the targets such as dielectric and plant water content. In this study we investigate multi temporal changes occurring to different crop types due to phenological changes using high-resolution TerraSAR-X imagers. The dataset includes 17 dual-polarimetry TSX data acquired from June 2012 to August 2013 in Lorestan province, Iran. Several features are extracted from polarized data and classified using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Training samples and different features employed in classification are also assessed in the study. Results show a satisfactory accuracy for classification which is about 0.91 in kappa coefficient.

AB Sugarcane products contribute significantly to the Brazilian economy, generating U.S. $12.2 billion in revenue in 2018. Identifying and monitoring factors that induce yield reduction, such as weed occurrence, is thus imperative. The detection of Bermudagrass in sugarcane crops using remote sensing data, however, is a challenge considering their spectral similarity. To overcome this limitation, this paper aims to explore the potential of texture features derived from images acquired by an optical sensor onboard anunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to detect Bermudagrass in sugarcane. Aerial images with a spatial resolution of 2 cm were acquired from a sugarcane field in Brazil. The Green-Red Vegetation Index and several texture metrics derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix were calculated to perform an automatic classification using arandom forest algorithm. Adding texture metrics to the classification process improved the overall accuracy from 83.00% to 92.54%, and this improvement was greater considering larger window sizes, since they representeda texture transition between two targets. Production losses induced by Bermudagrass presence reached 12.1 tons x ha(-1) in the study site. This study not only demonstrated the capacity of UAV images to overcome the well-known limitation of detecting Bermudagrass in sugarcane crops, but also highlighted the importance of texture for high-accuracy quantification of weed invasion in sugarcane crops.

AB The Netherlands based National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and the co-located Geomatics Business Park use the output of RAPIDS, a small 2.7m dish satellite data receiver system, on a daily basis. The satellite earth observation data are real time downlinked from the three Spot satellites and the ERS-2 radar satellite and subsequently processed into images.
   After georeferencing and cutting into mapsheets, the data are sent to a value adding company, which is an expert in image interpretation and classification for e.g. agricultural purposes. The so extracted agricultural information is collected in a database that can be accessed by the subscribers day after day. A semi-automatic georeferencing system has been integrated so the output data of the RAPIDS station can be implemented in, for example, a GIS directly. The database / GIS is a valuable tool for decision making with respect to land use, crop monitoring, flood monitoring etc.
   Although mainly based in the Netherlands and the U.K., the RAPIDS system is a mobile station: it is built on a trailer and can be transported very easily behind a car or in a normal aircraft for long distance transportation. In co-operation with satellite operators like Spot Image, ESA and possibly others, one is capable to receive and process mid resolution satellite data in near real time everywhere in the world! The direct access to satellite data provides a high level of autonomy, allowing operation in areas without appropriate infrastructure / communications to the conventional fixed receiving stations. The near-real-time availability of data makes the RAPIDS system suitable for near-real-time applications, which depend on prompt data delivery. At this moment the station is being upgraded for the receipt of Envisat data which can be done for other satellites like IRS and EROS etc. No other station has even managed to come close the cost price of RAPIDS. For reasons of pricing the footprint is limited: a diameter of approximately 1100-km.
   RAPIDS has already delivered data for a preliminary flood monitoring system in Bangladesh and a bathymetry system in Indonesia. Currently it is a mobile test system for Defense and acts in a commercial agricultural project within the Netherlands.
   The paper describes the data acquisition, -processing and distribution infrastructure used by NLR and the Geomatics Business Park, the projects / applications using this infrastructure and a future outlook to commercial remote sensing in the Netherlands.

We first restore missing data due to clouds and shadows based on vector and raster data fusion in different phases of classification methodology. Pixel-based classification maps are derived from an ensemble of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The proposed approach is applied for regional scale crop classification using multi-temporal Landsat-8 images for the JECAM site in the Kyivska oblast of Ukraine in 2013. The obtained results on crop area estimates are also compared to official statistics.

AB Estimation of crop water requirement (CWR) is key to the rational water use and agricultural water conservation in arid regions. Using remote sensing data to obtain long-term CWR over large areas helps water resources management in water-scarce areas. This study, taking the Kaidu-Kongqi River basin in arid northwest China as the study area, investigated the feasibility of synergistically using phenological characteristics, Savitzky-Golay filter, harmonic analysis and decision tree to extract crop planting structures (CPS) from MODIS EVI, and meanwhile analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in the estimated CWR. The results show that the integrated method for CPS identification and extraction is feasible and reliable with the classification accuracy over 80%. The mid-season stage requires the most water and cash crops need more water than cereal crops. Summer accounts for 69% the total growing season water use. The significant increase in the area of high water demand crops such as cotton raised the total CWR of the basin surging from 14.91x 10(8)m(3) in 2000 to 34.92x10(8)m(3) in 2017. The spatial distribution of CWR was more related to crop types and area than to climatic conditions. Controlling the expansion of arable land and optimizing the agricultural planting structure remain important tasks for the sustainable management of water resources in the basin.

CDL program inputs include medium resolution satellite imagery, USDA collected ground truth and other ancillary data, such as the National Land Cover Data set. A decision tree-supervised classification method is used to generate the freely available state-level crop cover classifications and provide crop acreage estimates based upon the CDL and NASS June Agricultural Survey ground truth to the NASS Agricultural Statistics Board. This paper provides an overview of the NASS CDL program. It describes various input data, processing procedures, classification and validation, accuracy assessment, CDL product specifications, dissemination venues and the crop acreage estimation methodology. In general, total crop mapping accuracies for the 2009 CDLs ranged from 85% to 95% for the major crop categories.

AB The Resourcesat-2 is a highly suitable satellite for crop classification studies with its improved features and capabilities. Data from one of its sensors, the linear imaging and self-scanning (LISS IV), which has a spatial resolution of 5.8 m, was used to compare the relative accuracies achieved by support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithms for the classification of various crops and non-crop covering a part of Varanasi district, Uttar Pradesh, India. The separability analysis was performed using a transformed divergence (TD) method between categories to assess the quality of training samples. The outcome of the present study indicates better performance of SVM and ANN algorithms in comparison to SAM for the classification using LISS IV sensor data. The overall accuracies obtained by SVM and ANN were 93.45% and 92.32%, respectively, whereas the lower accuracy of 74.99% was achieved using the SAM algorithm through error matrix analysis. Results derived from SVM, ANN, and SAM classification algorithms were validated with the ground truth information acquired by the field visit on the same day of satellite data acquisition.

DE Complex agricultural landscapes; crop mapping; discriminant space;

ID IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; PRIOR PROBABILITIES; ACCURACY
AB Crop mapping is related to planting conditions, remote sensing data source, and performances of various classifiers. Considering the above key factors, this study discusses a crop mapping approach for complex agricultural landscapes based on a conceptual frame that is called discriminant space. The introduced discriminant space-based model follows the pattern and process rules in geosciences and is found by the variables closely related to crop growth. On this basis, a method of classification based on probability calibration algorithm (CPCA) is developed, which consists of several steps. First, discriminant variables were extracted and then the experimental discriminant space was founded. Spectral analysis was carried out in this process to select the dominant impact factors for crop mapping. Based on the founded discriminant space, we calculated the class-conditional probabilities for each category using kernel density estimation and separated the residuals of class-conditional probabilities from the structural component through a trend-surface analysis. Then, calibration of the class-conditional probabilities was implemented using the predicted residuals generated by simple kriging with varying local means. Classification was achieved according to the calibrated probabilities with respect to each category. Accuracy assessment and kappa analysis were used to evaluate the identification results. Statistical test procedure was applied to measure the differences between classification maps and the validation data based on individual categories. Results are discussed for an intensively cropped area in south China. Compared with two other supervised classifiers, the overall accuracy of the proposal method increases by more than 10% and is able to achieve 87.12%. Moreover, there are some substantial increases in the producer's accuracy and the user's accuracy of single-cropping rice and late rice, with a precision increase of more than 15%, effectively improves the identification accuracy of rice in the research region. The proposed method overcomes the limitations due to spectrum characteristics and considers the structural and the random properties of spatial distribution for categories in local regions. Therefore, a similar operation can usually be implemented for crop identification of complex agricultural landscapes.

AB The outbreak of large-scale desert locust plague in 2020 has attracted wide attention in the world and caused serious damage to food security and livelihood of African and Asian people. Remote sensing techniques can provide indirect feedback on locust plagues, facilitating quick, and real-time monitoring of the occurrence and development of locusts, which is of great significance for ensuring national and regional food security and stability. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a classic machine learning model that has been widely applied in the fields of time-series data mining. In this study, we aim to predict the severity of locust plague in croplands using the time-series dynamic change features extracted from remote sensing data via HMM. In addition, we assess the damages on the croplands using change detection methods by comparing the crop spectrum before and after the locust plague from two-phase (Feburary 23 and March 7, 2020) hyperspectral images covering substudy area (northern Narok, Kenya). Evaluated by the ground truth data, the OA of predicted results of the plague severity in April, May, June, and July are 0.78, 0.71, 0.74, and 0.72, respectively. The land cover classification OA of the substudy area of the two-phase images are 97.45 and 96.14. Our study demonstrates the validity of the HMM-based method using the remote sensing time-series data to predict locust plague and evaluate its damage. The results of the cropland change detection suggest that the damage of locusts can be quantitatively evaluated using hyperspectral images.

AB The assumption of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy is to maintain good agricultural practices for sustainability in the environment. A number of requirements are imposed on farmers, including the maintenance of permanent grassland, fallow land or crop diversification. To meet these requirements, the European Union guarantees subsidies, but at the same time fields must be monitored focusing on crop identification. The limitation of field inspection and substituting it with crop recognition using satellite images could increase the effectiveness of this procedure. The application of satellite imagery in automatic detection and identification of dominant crops over a large area seems to be technically and economically sound. The paper discusses the concept and the results of automatic classification based on a Random Forests classifier performed on multitemporal images of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. A test site was established in a complex agricultural structure with long and narrow parcels in the south-eastern part of Poland. Time-series images acquired during the growing season 2016 were used for multispectral classification in different configurations: for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 separately and for both sensors integrated. Different Random Forests approaches and post-processing methods were examined based on independent data from farmers' declarations records, reaching the best accuracy of over 90% for crops like winter or spring cereals. Overall accuracy of the classification ranged from 72% to 91% depending on the classification variant. The elaborated scheme is novel in the context of Polish complex agricultural structure and smallholders.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to obtain remote sensing images of different growth stages of crops under all weather conditions. Such time-series SAR images can provide an abundance of temporal and spatial features for use in large-scale crop mapping and analysis. In this study, we propose a temporal feature-based segmentation (TFBS) model for accurate crop mapping using time-series SAR images. This model first extracts deep-seated temporal features and then learns the spatial context of the extracted temporal features for crop mapping. The results indicate that the TFBS model significantly outperforms traditional long short-term memory (LSTM), U-network, and convolutional LSTM models in crop mapping based on time-series SAR images. TFBS demonstrates better generalizability than other models in the study area, which makes it more transferable, and the results show that data augmentation can significantly improve this generalizability. The visualization of the temporal features extracted by the TFBS shows that there is a high degree of intraclass homogeneity among rice fields and interclass heterogeneity between rice fields and other features. TFBS also achieved the highest accuracy of the four deep learning models for multicrop classification in the study area. This study presents a feasible way of producing high-accuracy large-scale crop maps based on the proposed model.

AB In arid and semi-arid areas, evaporation fluxes are the largest component of the hydrological cycle, with runoff coefficient rarely exceeding 10%. These fluxes are a function of land use and land management and as such an essential component for integrated water resources management. Spatially distributed land use and land cover (LULC) maps distinguishing not only natural land cover but also management practices such as irrigation are therefore essential for comprehensive water management analysis in a river basin. Through remote sensing, LULC can be classified using its unique phenological variability observed over time. For this purpose, sixteen LULC types have been classified in the Upper Pangani River Basin (the headwaters of the Pangani River Basin in Tanzania) using MODIS vegetation satellite data. Ninety-four images based on 8 day temporal and 250 m spatial resolutions were analyzed for the hydrological years 2009 and 2010. Unsupervised and supervised clustering techniques were utilized to identify various LULC types with aid of ground information on crop calendar and the land features of the river basin. Ground truthing data were obtained during two rainfall seasons to assess the classification accuracy. The results showed an overall classification accuracy of 85%, with the producer's accuracy of 83% and user's accuracy of 86% for confidence level of 98% in the analysis. The overall Kappa coefficient of 0.85 also showed good agreement between the LULC and the ground data. The land suitability classification based on FAO-SYS framework for the various LULC types were also consistent with the derived classification results. The existing local database on total smallholder irrigation development and sugarcane cultivation (large scale irrigation) showed a 74% and 95% variation respectively to the LULC classification and showed fairly good geographical distribution. The LULC information provides an essential boundary condition for establishing the water use and management of green and blue water resources in the water stress Pangani River Basin.

AB Contrary to binary and multi-class classifiers, the purpose of a one-class classifier for remote sensing applications is to map only one specific land use/land cover class of interest. Training these classifiers exclusively requires reference data for the class of interest, while training data for other classes is not required. Thus, the acquisition of reference data can be significantly reduced. However, one-class classification is fraught with uncertainty and full automatization is difficult, due to the limited reference information that is available for classifier training. Thus, a user-oriented one-class classification strategy is proposed, which is based among others on the visualization and interpretation of the one-class classifier outcomes during the data processing. Careful interpretation of the diagnostic plots fosters the understanding of the classification outcome, e. g., the class separability and suitability of a particular threshold. In the absence of complete and representative validation data, which is the fact in the context of a real one-class classification application, such information is valuable for evaluation and improving the classification. The potential of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by classifying different crop types with hyperspectral data from Hyperion.

ID GIS; SIMULATION; MODELS
AB The vegetation cover of the Earth plays an important role in the life of mankind, whether it is natural forest or agricultural crop. The study of the variability of the vegetation cover, as well as observation of its condition, allows timely actions to make a forecast and monitor and estimate the forest fire condition. The objectives of the research were (i) to process the satellite image of the Gilbirinskiy forestry located in the basin of Lake Baikal; (ii) to select homogeneous areas of forest vegetation on the basis of their spectral characteristics; (iii) to estimate the level of forest fire danger of the area by vegetation types. The paper presents an approach for estimation of forest fire danger depending on vegetation type and radiant heat flux influence using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing data. The Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) and the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) software were used to process satellite images. The area's forest fire danger estimation and visual presentation of the results were carried out in ArcGIS Desktop software. Information on the vegetation was obtained using the analysis of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images for a typical forestry of the Lake Baikal natural area. The maps (schemes) of the Gilbirinskiy forestry were also used in the present article. The unsupervised k-means classification was used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to increase the accuracy of decoding. The classification of forest areas according to the level of fire danger caused by the typical ignition source was carried out using the developed method. The final information product was the map displaying vector polygonal feature class, containing the type of vegetation and the level of fire danger for each forest quarter in the attribute table. The fire danger estimation method developed by the authors was applied to each separate quarter and showed realistic results.

AB Crop production potential is an index used to evaluate crop productivity capacity in one region. The spatial production potential can help give the maximum value of crop yield and visually clarify the prospects of agricultural development. The DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) model has been used in crop growth analysis, but spatial simulation and analysis at high resolution have not been widely performed for exact crop planting locations. In this study, the light-temperature production potential of winter wheat was simulated with the DSSAT model in the winter wheat planting area, extracted according to Remote Sensing (RS) image data in the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) region. To obtain the precise study area, a Decision Tree (DT) classification was used to extract the winter wheat planting area. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was used to process spatial data and provide a map of the spatial distribution of the production potential. The production potential of winter wheat was estimated in batches with the DSSAT model. The results showed that the light-temperature production potential is between 4238 and 10,774 kg/ha in JJJ. The production potential in the central part of the planting area is higher than that in the south and north in JJJ due to the influences of light and temperature. These results can be useful for crop model simulation users and decision makers in JJJ.

AB Beginning in 2015, Danish farmers are obliged to meet specific crop diversification rules based on total land area and number of crops cultivated to be eligible for new greening subsidies. Hence, there is a need for the Danish government to extend their subsidy control system to verify farmers' declarations to warrant greening payments under the new crop diversification rules. Remote Sensing (RS) technology has been used since 1992 to control farmers' subsidies in Denmark. However, a proper RS-based approach is yet to be finalised to validate new crop diversity requirements designed for assessing compliance under the recent subsidy scheme (2014-2020); This study uses an ensemble classification approach (proposed by the authors in previous studies) for validating the crop diversity requirements of the new rules. The approach uses a neural network ensemble classification system with bi-temporal (spring and early summer) WorldView-2 imagery (WV2) and includes the following steps: (1) automatic computation of pixel-based prediction probabilities using multiple neural networks; (2) quantification of the classification uncertainty using Endorsement Theory (ET); (3) discrimination of crop pixels and validation of the crop diversification rules at farm lever; and (4) identification of farmers who are violating the requirements for greening subsidies. The prediction probabilities are computed by a neural network ensemble supplied with training samples selected automatically using farmers declared parcels (field vectors containing crop information and the field boundary of each crop). Crop discrimination is performed, by considering a set of conclusions derived from individual neural networks based on ET. Verification of the diversification rules is performed by incorporating pixel-based classification uncertainty or confidence intervals with the class labels at the farmer level. The proposed approach was tested with WV2 imagery acquired in 2011 for a study area in Vennebjerg, Denmark, containing 132 farmers, 1258 fields, and 18 crops. The classification results obtained show an overall accuracy of 90.2%. The RS-based results suggest that 36 farmers did not follow the crop diversification rules that would qualify for the greening subsidies. When compared to the farmers' reported crop mixes, irrespective of the rule, the RS results indicate that false crop declarations were made by 8 farmers, covering 15 fields. If the farmers' reports had been submitted for the new greening subsidies, 3 farmers would have made a false claim; while remaining 5 farmers obey the rules of required crop proportion even though they have submitted the false crop code due to their small holding size. The RS results would have supported 96 farmers for greening subsidy claims, with no instances of suggesting a greening subsidy for a holding that the farmer did not report as meeting the required conditions. These results suggest that the proposed RS based method shows great promise for validating the new greening subsidies in Denmark. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Timely mapping of corn and soybean plays an important role in food security in the USA. A subpixel fraction derived from Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) imagery during growing seasons is desired in order to help local farmers monitor crop growth and manage them in a timely fashion. However, two obstacles need to be surpassed before such fractional information can be made available: 1) the endmember spectral reflectance of corn and soybean varies with time and location; 2) no methods have been tested for deriving fractional maps of corn and soybean throughout the growing season. Therefore, in this research, we have set aside two objectives: 1) To account for endmember variability of corn and soybean during their growing seasons; 2) To derive multi-temporal fractional maps for corn and soybeans with Landsat and monitor the growing status of corn and soybean. Accordingly, we employed three endmember optimization methods and the state-of-the-art unmixing method Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to acquire corn and soybean fractional maps based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). Applying the method on Landsat 8 images from April to September 2017, we generated multi-temporal fractional maps of corn and soybean in Grundy County and analysed their changes. Up to 94.76% of our study area was successfully explained by the unmixing model. The crop fraction in both corn and soybean fields was about 15.00% during the planting stage, and increased to nearly 80.00% in the peak growing season. The crop fractions remained high during harvest, which could be attributed to crop residues in the field. These findings correspond well with the growth stages provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). That the corn growing season was earlier than soybeans was also well represented by the fractional change analysis. Moreover, among all the fractional maps, the results in the peak growing time (29 July 2017 in this study) had the highest agreement with classification results, with an overall accuracy of 85.07%. This research shows the great potential of monitoring corn and soybean growth conditions with fractional maps. The methods in this study, implemented in GEE, can be easily transferred to other crops and other locations.

AB The global coverage of Sentinel-2 provides widespread opportunities for accurately mapping and monitoring key crops in emerging countries, like in the case of Nepal's rice production. While previous studies based on other satellites show some important spatial and temporal limitations, the use of operational Sentinel-2 data still remains unexplored in this regard. As a result, this work investigates the viability of using the Sentinel-2 instrument for a precise rice crop classification in Nepal. Initially, we define a dataset made of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data from the Terai region of Nepal. Then, we conduct several classification experiments to provide empirical evidences about the suitability of different classification models when identifying rice crops in developing countries, where only limited ground-truth data could be available. The experiments reveal the suitability of using Sentinel-2 for accurately mapping rice crops in Nepal with a CNN-based classification model.

AB Cotton root rot (CRR), caused by the fungusPhymatotrichopsis omnivora, is a destructive cotton disease that mainly affects the crop in Texas. Flutriafol fungicide applied at or soon after planting has been proven effective at protecting cotton plants from being infected by CRR. Previous research has indicated that CRR will reoccur in the same regions of a field as in past years. CRR-infected plants can be detected with aerial remote sensing (RS). As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been introduced into agricultural RS, the spatial resolution of farm images has increased significantly, making plant-by-plant (PBP) CRR classification possible. An unsupervised classification algorithm, PBP, based on the Superpixel concept, was developed to delineate CRR-infested areas at roughly the single-plant level. Five-band multispectral data were collected with a UAV to test these methods. The results indicated that the single-plant level classification achieved overall accuracy as high as 95.94%. Compared to regional classifications, PBP classification performed better in overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, errors of commission, and errors of omission. The single-plant fungicide application was also effective in preventing CRR.

AB Agricultural activities conducted in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya show a significant decline of productivity levels. This phenomenon is mainly related to limited availability of water resources, lack of supporting irrigation, and harvesting techniques ineffectiveness. Production risks reduction is closely related with a better use of water resources and a better understanding of the effects resulting from the multiple interactions between climate, agricultural vegetation, soil type, and crops management techniques. In this paper, a remote and automatic agricultural monitoring system is presented as an effective alternative to the most traditional in situ measurements and observations. We investigated the use of phenological information extracted from satellite imagery combined with crop calendar and supported by agro-ecological zoning (AEZ) in accurate crop classification and monitoring. Vegetation indices extracted from Landsat 8 imagery are capable to track the vegetation development through the year, then phenological profiles can be extracted and implemented into a multitemporal automatic classification process to detect agricultural areas and to discriminate among different crop species. The phenological profiles extracted by satellite imagery are compared with crop calendar data compiled by FAO for the area of interest. The classification procedure is supported by AEZs based on crop modeling and environmental matching procedures in order to identify crop-specific environmental limitations under assumed levels of inputs and management conditions. The FAO crop water productivity model AquaCrop is calibrated for wheat and maize yield mapping in the central highland of Kenya, handling both environmental and phenological data. The combined use of phenological data and AEZs results in a robust methodology with a classification overall accuracy of 91.35%. A good model performance is obtained relative to yield predictions, with R of 0.69 and 0.72.

AB Weed interference during crop establishment is a serious concern for Florida strawberry [Fragariaxananassa (Weston) Duchesne ex Rozier (pro sp.) [chiloensisxvirginiana]] producers. In situ remote detection for precision herbicide application reduces both the risk of crop injury and herbicide inputs. Carolina geranium (Geranium carolinianum L.) is a widespread broadleaf weed within Florida strawberry production with sensitivity to clopyralid, the only available POST broadleaf herbicide. Geranium carolinianum leaf structure is distinct from that of the strawberry plant, which makes it an ideal candidate for pattern recognition in digital images via convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study objective was to assess the precision of three CNNs in detecting G. carolinianum. Images of G. carolinianum growing in competition with strawberry were gathered at four sites in Hillsborough County, FL. Three CNNs were compared, including object detection-based DetectNet, image classification-based VGGNet, and GoogLeNet. Two DetectNet networks were trained to detect either leaves or canopies of G. carolinianum. Image classification using GoogLeNet and VGGNet was largely unsuccessful during validation with whole images (Fscore<0.02). CNN training using cropped images increased G. carolinianum detection during validation for VGGNet (Fscore=0.77) and GoogLeNet (Fscore=0.62). The G. carolinianum leaf-trained DetectNet achieved the highest Fscore (0.94) for plant detection during validation. Leaf-based detection led to more consistent detection of G. carolinianum within the strawberry canopy and reduced recall-related errors encountered in canopy-based training. The smaller target of leaf-based DetectNet did increase false positives, but such errors can be overcome with additional training images for network desensitization training. DetectNet was the most viable CNN tested for image-based remote sensing of G. carolinianum in competition with strawberry. Future research will identify the optimal approach for in situ detection and integrate the detection technology with a precision sprayer.

ID AREA
AB The present study was undertaken to explore the applicability of multi date satellite imageries for assessment of paddy stubble burnt areas in Karnal; a major paddy growing district of Haryana. Temporal data sets (pre-burning and post-burning during the year 2017) of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), having spatial resolution of 30 meters and temporal resolution of 16 days were used for the quantitative estimation of burnt areas. Due to non availability of multidate cloud free Lands at 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data, two images viz. September 20, 2017 and October 22, 2017 data were used for the study. Moderate resolution Landsat OLI data provides estimate of the burnt area, however; frequent assessment was not possible due to presence of cloud cover during the rice harvesting period. Supervised classification technique was used for the analysis of digital data in order to generate land cover type through selection of reference training sites. Images were classified into 6 major classes namely burnt area, other crops & grasses, water body, built-up land, forest/tree, and fallow land. To improve the classification accuracy, the non-agricultural areas were masked out. The area was estimated by computing pixels under the classified image using post classification technique. The area estimates are based on the available Landsat OLI classified satellite data and the paddy stubble burnt area as identified on the October 22, 2017 image. Total paddy stubble burnt area was observed to be 49000ha; which is almost 28.4% of the total rice area grown in Karnal (1, 72, 474 ha). Study indicates that concentration of paddy stubble burnt area is more in Assandh and Karnal tehsils of Karnal as compared to others. Concentration of paddy stubble burnt area is moderate in Gharaunda and Nilokheri tehsil while in Indri tehsil, very less paddy stubble burning was observed. The reduced burning in Indri tehsil might be due to cultivation of scented rice. The scented rice is manually harvested and the straw is being used as animal feed, thus restricting burning of residues. The present study summarizes that remote sensing can be used as an effective tool for estimating the rice stubble burnt area to further help in value addition of weather based agro-advisory.

AB Automatic crop identification and monitoring is a key element in enhancing food production processes as well as diminishing the related environmental impact. Although several efficient deep learning techniques have emerged in the field of multispectral imagery analysis, the crop classification problem still needs more accurate solutions. This work introduces a competitive methodology for crop classification from multispectral satellite imagery mainly using an enhanced 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) designed at a smaller-scale architecture, as well as a novel post-processing step. The proposed methodology contains four steps: image stacking, patch extraction, classification model design (based on a 2D-CNN architecture), and post-processing. First, the images are stacked to increase the number of features. Second, the input images are split into patches and fed into the 2D-CNN model. Then, the 2D-CNN model is constructed within a small-scale framework, and properly trained to recognize 10 different types of crops. Finally, a post-processing step is performed in order to reduce the classification error caused by lower-spatial-resolution images. Experiments were carried over the so-named Campo Verde database, which consists of a set of satellite images captured by Landsat and Sentinel satellites from the municipality of Campo Verde, Brazil. In contrast to the maximum accuracy values reached by remarkable works reported in the literature (amounting to an overall accuracy of about 81%, a f(1) score of 75.89%, and average accuracy of 73.35%), the proposed methodology achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 81.20%, a f(1) score of 75.89%, and an average accuracy of 88.72% when classifying 10 different crops, while ensuring an adequate trade-off between the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and accuracy. Furthermore, given its ability to effectively classify patches from two image sequences, this methodology may result appealing for other real-world applications, such as the classification of urban materials.

AB The identification of vegetation using remote sensing imagery is an important area of work with numerous applications such as the analysis of deforestation and crop monitoring. This work focuses on locating populations of an endemic shrub of the Canary Islands that grows in Teide National Park: the Teide broom. The objective is to determine automatically the location of this species in order to facilitate conservation efforts.
   For this purpose, a methodology is presented based on image analysis by using superpixels as the minimum image processing unit, combined with one-class classification. The proposed scheme has been analyzed by applying it to an area located at the northwest of the Teide National Park where the existence of populations of this shrub was known a priori.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Geometrical and thematic data about terrain objects stored in a geographical information system (GIS) can be kept up-to-date by using remote sensing (RS) data. Geometrical and thematic data can be extracted from the RS data by segmentation and classification techniques respectively. The possibilities and reliability of the information extraction from RS data can be improved by the use of ancillary data and knowledge about the terrain objects. Object classification and aggregation hierarchies can be used to describe relationships between terrain objects; the categorization of the different types of terrain object dynamics that is presented will be based partly on these hierarchical relationships.
   Object models will be applied in a case study in which both the field geometry (field boundaries) and the crop type of agricultural fields are updated from a Landsat TM image. For that purpose, a three-stage strategy has been developed. In the first stage, the results of an edge detection procedure are integrated with fixed geometrical data already contained in the GIS by using knowledge about the aggregation structure and shape of the fields. In the next stage, the crop type of the fields is determined by means of object-based classification. Finally, conditional merging is performed to solve the problem of oversegmentation. The resulting field geometry was found to agree for 87% with the field geometry as determined by a photo-interpreter.

AB Crop residues on the soil surface reduce soil erosion and affect water infiltration, evaporation, and soil temperatures. Crop residues also influence the flow of nutrients, carbon, water, and energy in agricultural ecosystems. Current methods of measuring crop residue cover are inadequate for monitoring large areas. One promising remote sensing approach for discriminating crop residues from soil is based on a broad absorption band near 2100 nm that appears in plant materials and is absent in most soils. The cellulose absorption index (CAI), which measured the relative depth of this absorption feature, was linearly related to crop residue cover. High-altitude AVIRIS data acquired on 11 May 2000 prior to spring crop planting at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland were analyzed. NDVI was calculated using bands centered at 827 nm and 646 nm and CAI was calculated using bands at 2031, 2101, and 2211 nm. Agricultural fields with low green vegetation cover (low NDVI) were classified into three tillage categories based on crop residue cover determined by CAI. Fields with >30% residue cover were classified as conservation tillage; those with 15-30% residue cover as reduced tillage; and those with <15% residue cover as intensive tillage. The tillage classification agreed with ground observations in corn harvested for grain and tilled fields. Soybean fields and mowed alfalfa fields had low residue cover even with no tillage. Thus, both residue cover and previous crop type are necessary to classify tillage intensity in agricultural fields.

Two study sites were provided, a bergamot and an onion crop located in Calabria (Italy). The Large-Scale Mean-Shift (LSMS), integrated into the Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) suite, the Shepherd algorithm implemented in the Python Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems software Library (RSGISLib), and the Multi-Resolution Segmentation (MRS) algorithm implemented in eCognition, were tested. Four classification algorithms were assessed: K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Normal Bayes (NB). The obtained segmentations were compared using geometric and non-geometric indices, while the classification results were compared in terms of overall, user's and producer's accuracy, and multi-class F-scoreM. The statistical significance of the classification accuracy outputs was assessed using McNemar's test. The SVM and RF resulted as the most stable classifiers and less influenced by the software used and the scene's characteristics, with OA values never lower than 81.0% and 91.20%. The NB algorithm obtained the highest OA in the Orchard-study site, using OTB and eCognition. NB performed in Scikit-learn results in the lower (73.80%). RF and SVM obtained an OA>90% in the Crop-study site.

AB Remotely sensed satellite data have shown their ability to map and monitor different crops. In this research work, in addition to crop acreage estimation of a province in Iran, different supervised classification techniques have been used to study their performances for crop area estimation in comparison with statistics provided by the agricultural statistics and information department (ASID) of the ministry of Agriculture of Iran. A total number of nine IRS LISSIII scenes acquired in 1998 pertaining to Markazi province of Iran were registered and used to make a mosaic of the whole province using EASI/PACE image processing software. Since images have been acquired in different date of the year 98, different training sites were selected for a single crop. Different supervised classification algorithms were Applied to estimate crop acreage using similar training sites. The results of comparison between areas derived from classification techniques and area reported by ASID shows that maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm in conjunction with parallelepiped algorithm is suitable for total crop area estimation. And based on the KAPPA coefficients of different classification algorithms, it is concluded that the best algorithm is MLC.

ID ACCURACY
AB Land-cover studies based on optical remote sensing in regions which exhibit disorderly urban growth and quick-use conversion of farmland to non-farm usage face problems due to inaccurate discrimination of cover types and hence inaccurate extent estimations. The use of data in the visible and infrared areas of the electromagnetic spectrum for classifying crop types has been extensively explored, concluding that data acquisitions must be made during critical crop development periods. This raises a concern in Central Mexico where such periods coincide with important cloud coverage and where good estimates of the extent of agricultural areas and of particular crops are keenly sought by government agencies for planning purposes. Due to the interest in accurate and updated maps for this area, repeated studies have been carried out over a number of years by the National Institute of Research for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock for the Ministry of Agriculture of Mexico. Taking into consideration the difficulties of acquiring and analysing data derived from optical sensors, the objective of this study was to assess the advantages of combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in producing more accurate maps. The study area covers 15 634 ha and is located in Central Mexico in a region where agricultural plots of varied sizes and forms are interspersed with rapid urbanization spaces. We investigated alternative supervised classification schemes combining the Radarsat-1 C-band with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) bands to estimate land cover distributions and assess the quality of results with field data. Then, we set forth and evaluated a methodology which applies data fusion of selected Landsat ETM+ bands and the C-radar band. The separation and similarities for vegetated and non-vegetated cover types depends on whether the selected agricultural crops are annual or perennial, and on whether there are bare soils present. This knowledge for the particular study area influenced the selection of dates for image take and analysis. Partial fused and non-fused land-cover maps were assessed for accuracy and were combined to obtain a final map. The results demonstrate that the combined utilization of optical and radar imagery yields useful land cover information and improved classification accuracy over those obtained using either type of image on its own.

AB An investigation on canal irrigation performance assessment and monitoring of Halvad taluka in Surendranagar district of Gujarat, India using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) was carried during May, 2015 to July, 2015 at Bhaskaracharya Institute For Space Applications and Geo-Informatics (BISAG), Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The Area of Interest (AOI) covering Halvad Taluka was generated from the IRS LISSS-III digital data of 2006 and 2014 using the Halvad Taluka boundary. This data was analyzed using unsupervised and supervised classification techniques for area estimation under various land use classes like Agriculture, Wasteland, Fallow land, General Build-up, Water etc. The Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements were used to locate different-different places on raster image. Various classes spectral signature was generated for supervised classification. Using ERDAS Imagine software we have applied change detection techniques for analysing land-use and land-cover (LULC) change, urban change, etc. The results of supervised classification of IRS LISS-III digital data of 2006 and 2014 crop seasons indicated area under irrigated agricultures has increased during 2014 as compare to 2006. This is mainly because of reduction in area under waste lands and fallow lands. Due to increase in irrigation facilities area under different crops have increased. The result of this brings out the impact of irrigation on the agriculture in the Halvad Taluka.

AB To understand water productivity of crops cultivated in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, this study was conducted to generate a reliable crop type map using a multi-temporal satellite data (ASTER, Landsat-8 and MODIS) and crop phenology. Classification And Regression Tree (CART) and ISO-DATA Cluster (IDC) classification techniques were utilized for the identification of crops. The Ideal Crop Spectral Curves were generated and utilized for the formulation of CART decision rules. For IDC, the stacked images of the phenology-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were utilized for the classification. The overall accuracy of the classified maps of CART was 76, 77 and 81% for ASTER, MODIS and Landsat-8, respectively. For IDC, the accuracy was determined at 67, 63 and 60% for ASTER, MODIS and Landsat-8, respectively. The developed decision rules can be efficiently used for mapping of crop types for the same agro-climatic region of the study area.

AB Mangroves are one of the most important coastal wetland ecosystems, and the compositions and distributions of mangrove species are essential for conservation and restoration efforts. Many studies have explored this topic using remote sensing images that were obtained by satellite-borne and airborne sensors, which are known to be efficient for monitoring the mangrove ecosystem. With improvements in carrier platforms and sensor technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high-resolution hyperspectral images in both spectral and spatial domains have been used to monitor crops, forests, and other landscapes of interest. This study aims to classify mangrove species on Qi'ao Island using object-based image analysis techniques based on UAV hyperspectral images obtained from a commercial hyperspectral imaging sensor (UHD 185) onboard a UAV platform. First, the image objects were obtained by segmenting the UAV hyperspectral image and the UAV-derived digital surface model (DSM) data. Second, spectral features, textural features, and vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted from the UAV hyperspectral image, and the UAV-derived DSM data were used to extract height information. Third, the classification and regression tree (CART) method was used to selection bands, and the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) algorithm was employed for feature reduction. Finally, the objects were classified into different mangrove species and other land covers based on their spectral and spatial characteristic differences. The classification results showed that when considering the three features (spectral features, textural features, and hyperspectral VIs), the overall classification accuracies of the two classifiers used in this paper, i.e., k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), were 76.12% (Kappa = 0.73) and 82.39% (Kappa = 0.801), respectively. After incorporating tree height into the classification features, the accuracy of species classification increased, and the overall classification accuracies of KNN and SVM reached 82.09% (Kappa = 0.797) and 88.66% (Kappa = 0.871), respectively. It is clear that SVM outperformed KNN for mangrove species classification. These results also suggest that height information is effective for discriminating mangrove species with similar spectral signatures, but different heights. In addition, the classification accuracy and performance of SVM can be further improved by feature reduction. The overall results provided evidence for the effectiveness and potential of UAV hyperspectral data for mangrove species identification.

AB Land use/land cover is an important component in understanding the interactions of the human activities with the environment and thus it is necessary to monitor and detect the changes to maintain a sustainable environment. In this paper an attempt has been made to study the changes in land use and land cover of southern part of West Godavari district. The study was carried out through Remote Sensing and GIS approach using SOI toposheets, Landsat imagery of 2000 and IRS-1D-LISS-III 2010. The land use/land cover classification was performed based on the Survey of India toposheets and Satellite imageries. GIS software is used to prepare the thematic maps and ground truth observations were also performed to check the accuracy of the classification. The present study has brought out that the aquaculture tanks have been decreased from 33.02% to 25.66% during 2000-2010 with a net decrease of 7.34%. Agriculture was also decreased from 43.32% to 37.75% with a net decrease of 5.56% during 2000-2010. The reasons for this decrease have been discussed. However, some plantations mixed with crops, fallow lands and settlements have shown considerable increase. The areas under natural streams/rivulets, mangroves etc have shown no significant change and can be considered as a positive sign for sustainable development. Though there are some changes detected in landuse/land cover analysis of the period 2000-2010, it does not indicate any significant environmental impact on the study area. However, it is necessary to closely monitor the landuse/land cover changes for maintaining a sustainable environment.

AB Recently launched and upcoming satellite systems are expected to make crop mapping increasingly accurate and operational. This study aims at an evaluation of the optimum number of acquisition dates and most suitable temporal windows for the discrimination of crops over heterogeneous agricultural landscapes utilizing multitemporal data from the RapidEye satellite constellation. For a case study site in West-Uzbekistan, which covers 230,000 ha of irrigated land, nine 6.5 m RapidEye mosaics were obtained throughout the vegetation period of 2009. The acquisition window of one mosaic was maximum five days. The optimum number of acquisition dates and acquisition windows relevant for accurate crop identification was assessed by applying a random forest algorithm to all possible combinations of the available RapidEye mosaics.
   Overall accuracy increased with the number of acquisition dates selected for the classification. Classifying all nine mosaics resulted in an overall accuracy of 85.7%. This accuracy level could be already achieved by using five or more acquisitions during distinctive phases of the vegetation period, among others short before winter-wheat harvest and in initial growing phases of summer crops. It could be shown that accurate early season crop maps at field level can be derived enabling water managers to update water distribution schedules in the study region. All 53,302 fields of the irrigation system including very small parcels with a size of 0.05 ha could be classified due to the high geometric resolution of RapidEye. Detailed NDVI temporal profiles demonstrated the potential of RapidEye for including minor crops into classifications of heterogeneous agricultural areas. Class-wise accuracy pointed to the challenge of classifying sub-tree cultivation and indicated that classification of minor crops could also depend on the spatial resolution of satellite images. The case study suggests identifying temporal windows for crop mapping serving as substantial support for land and water management in different agro-environmental settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Advances in spaceborne hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing, cloud-computing, and machine learning can help measure, model, map and monitor agricultural crops to address global food and water security issues, such as by providing accurate estimates of crop area and yield to model agricultural productivity. Leveraging these advances, we used the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion historical archive and the new generation DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) data to evaluate the performance of hyperspectral narrowbands in classifying major agricultural crops of the U.S. with machine learning (ML) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). EO-1 Hyperion images from the 2010-2013 growing seasons and DESIS images from the 2019 growing season were used to classify three world crops (corn, soybean, and winter wheat) along with other crops and non-crops near Ponca City, Oklahoma, USA. The supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB), and the unsupervised clustering algorithm WekaXMeans (WXM) were run using selected optimal Hyperion and DESIS HS narrowbands (HNBs). RF and SVM returned the highest overall producer's, and user's accuracies, with the performances of NB and WXM being substantially lower. The best accuracies were achieved with two or three images throughout the growing season, especially a combination of an earlier month (June or July) and a later month (August or September). The narrow 2.55 nm bandwidth of DESIS provided numerous spectral features along the 400-1000 nm spectral range relative to smoother Hyperion spectral signatures with 10 nm bandwidth in the 400-2500 nm spectral range. Out of 235 DESIS HNBs, 29 were deemed optimal for agricultural study. Advances in ML and cloud-computing can greatly facilitate HS data analysis, especially as more HS datasets, tools, and algorithms become available on the Cloud.

AB The agricultural sector consumes most of the groundwater in Jordan, and Mujib basin is one of the most important available ground basins. Unsupervised classification has been applied on multitemporal satellite image for an arid region such as Mujib basin in order to identify the types of irrigated agricultural crops present in it, where it consisted of vegetables, field crops and fruit trees. Then find the reference evapotranspiration values and estimate crop coefficient values for each crop to calculate the water requirements of irrigated crops in order to find the quantities of water consumption in the basin which amounted to 29.7 million cubic meters. Where area of irrigated crops reached about 59 km2, which represents 1% of the total basin area and its concentrated in the northern and eastern regions, while rainfed agricultural activity was found in the western part of the basin. Vegetables are consumed high quantities of water, especially summer ones. Where this water is invaluable, and its importance will increase greatly soon as a result of high evaporation rates and scarcity of water resources in the region besides presence the political conflicts on these water resources. The classification of lands using multitemporal images from Sentinel satellite led to obtain more accurate results about the irrigated agricultural crops in terms of cultivation dates, duration, harvest time, monitoring the crop, determining its type and calculating its area.

AB The purpose of this article is to investigate the possibilities of mapping crop condition using high resolution (HR) satellite images for Zhiten test site situated in Northeast Bulgaria. The chosen satellite images are acquired from multispectral QuickBird-2 and panchromatic WorldView-1 sensors on 31/05/2009 and 30/11/2011, respectively. The methodology of this article includes the following working stages: 1) applying arable mask from CORINE 2006 land-cover database; 2) conducting per-pixel supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for crop identification; 3) applying accuracy assessment tool in ERDAS Imagine and deriving accuracy totals and Kappa statistics; 4) mapping crop condition using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) indices. The overall classification accuracy for the QuickBird-2 image is 90.86 % and overall Kappa statistics is 0.8538, while for the WorldView-1 image is 86.71 % and overall Kappa statistics is 0.7721. The SAVI shows better sensitivity for the spring crops cultivars with less than 40 % vegetation cover. Meanwhile, the NDVI gives good results for winter crops, but saturates at high vegetation dencity and gives generalized results for values less than 0.40. Overall RDVI gives better crop condition results for winter crops at flowering and grain filling phenophases and spring crops at vegetative phase compared to NDVI and SAVI.

AB Paddy (Oryza Sativa, sp.) is the main food commodity of most Indonesian. Generally, Indonesia has several rice crop varieties, which are selectively planted by farmers to increase rice crop production value. Recorded in 2019, Cidahu has a relatively high value of paddy rice production of 20.721 tons. One effective way of monitoring rice crops is by utilizing remote sensing technology, both radar and optical imagery. Radar and optical datasets are very potential to be applied in tropical and sub-tropical regions, which are prone to cloud-cover. The combination of the two complement each other in increasing the accuracy of classification. This study aims to analyze the spatial phenology of paddy, map the distribution patterns of paddy rice varieties, and analyze rice crop production's spatial patterns using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imageries in Cidahu sub- district, Sukabumi Regency. The combination of polarization from SAR and vegetation index from optical images are used to determine the planting stages of paddy, which then serves as a guide for identifying rice varieties. The paddy stages are categorized into land preparation, vegetative, generative, and maturative. The yield from the 3,443 hectares of harvested area is 20.000-21.000 tons per hectare.

AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become the core of modern machine learning approaches. In addition to its inspiring interior design idea, the success of CNN depends mainly on two factors, the first is the availability of training data and the second is the computing power of the used devices. In the field of remote sensing, data availability is difficult and expensive. Furthermore, processing large remote sensing data to accommodate different models is a laborious process. At the same time, training data is often collected in the form of points distributed over crop fields rather than regions, which results in the scarcity of training data. To specifically address the scarcity of training points, in this paper we present a sparse pixel-based training of U-Net convolutional neural networks for land cover classification. Training images are reconstructed from the points' collection in a random manner, they are used as an input for the convolution networks. Based on this proposed method, the amount of training data is reproduced from the different spectral signals for each land cover. We conducted extensive experiments on eight classes, using ground truth data collected from several locations in Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. The obtained results showed the superiority of the proposed method over other methods.

AB Crop area statistics and yield prediction will affect adjustment of agricultural policy, to a certain extent. With the development of computer automatic classification techniques, the performance of classifiers are influenced by feature preprocessing and sample selection. Remote sensing classification according to spectral information is affected by false negatives and miscalculation in the complex spectrum area. Corn planting areas and other land-cover objects contain different surface structures and smoothness; other vegetation and villages have coarse textures. This paper introduces texture information based on a Gabor filter group to enrich land-cover information and establish a spectrum-texture feature set. With more samples, the algorithm efficiency is greatly affected. This paper proposes an improved fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) with an adaptive boost strategy, namely Adaboost FAM. Weak classifiers are trained to construct strong classifiers so as to improve operation efficiency. Meanwhile, classification accuracy will not be greatly improved. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves extraction accuracy when compared to classical algorithms, and improves efficiency when compared to algorithms which contain a great number of samples.

AB Spatially distributed hydrological modelling is required to understand and predict erosion, flooding and pollution risks that affect the vine cultivated Mediterranean environment. Previous field studies have demonstrated the dominant influence of soil surface features on overland flow and they therefore constitute an essential input to the hydrological model. In this paper we propose a remote sensing based method to map vineyard soil surface features with a spatial and temporal resolution appropriate for integration into the model. Our goal was to classify each soil surface portion in accordance with a pre-established, field measured infiltration capacity based typology. The radiometric characteristics of the classes of this typology were measured in the field and their Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) was modelled. Vineyard sunlit soil surface pixels were automatically extracted from high spatial resolution scanned aerial colour photographs [Wassenaar, T., Baret, F., Robbez-Masson, J.M., Andrieux, P., 2001. Sunlit soil surface extraction from remotely sensed imagery of perennial, discontinuous crop areas; the case of Mediterranean vineyards. Agronomie-Agriculture and Environment 21, 235-245; Wassenaar, T., Robbez-Masson, J.M., Andrieux, P., Baret, F., 2002. Vineyard identification and description of spatial crop structure by per-field frequency analysis. International Journal of Remote Sensing 23 (17), 3311-3325]. These pixels are radiometrically classified by comparison of their reflectance with BRDF-based reflectance predictions of each soil surface type for the specific illumination and viewing geometry of the pixel.
   The results show that most hydrological soil surface classes have distinct bi-directional radiometric properties. For one given geometric configuration however, the predicted reflectance ranges of some classes can considerably overlap (tilled soils and stone layers for example), while others can always unambiguously be identified (bare soil crusts, surfaces covered for more than 50% by weed or litter).
   We conclude that our fuzzy classification approach and the simple radiometric information used, allow us to identify the majority of the hydrological surface types. The method can easily be transposed in time and space. Its performance quite strongly depends on the radiometric and geometric accuracy of the input data. Significant improvements in soil surface classification precision are expected from considering spatial context information and monitoring the soil surface evolution. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB This research presents an operative application of satellite based technologies to estimate crop Water requirements (CWR) on regional level. The study is located in the agricultural area of Marchfeld (Lower Austria) and focuses on the year 2012. Agricultural production in this region requires irrigation which draws its resources from the groundwater. Due to its impact on hydrology and environment this practice necessitates close monitoring and management. In this process the CWR is an important piece of information, which can be derived from satellite data. We used multi-temporal (6 acquisitions, with an average revisit time of 16 days) and multi-spectral (visible and near-infrared) imagery of the DEIMOS-1 satellite sensor data in combination with local agro-meteorological measurements. In a first step, the leaf area index (LAI) and albedo maps were derived from atmospherically corrected satellite data. Those were used to generate maps of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) by direct application of the Penman-Monteith equation. Then, we produced a crop mask of the areas potentially irrigated. This was achieved by using an unsupervised image classification approach in combination with a post-classification analysis of the time-series of the crop development. Rain gauges data from a number of weather stations were spatially interpolated to produce a map of precipitation (P). Finally, the crop water requirements were calculated as the difference between ETp and the precipitation and aggregated over 10-day interval periods. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for the growing period resulted in 391 mm. The extent of irrigated crops covered an area of 21,278 ha with a maximum ETp of 5.6 mm/day at the end of June. The total crop water requirement resulted in 34.26 million m(3) for the year 2012.

AB The accuracy of dryland crop classification using satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is often unsatisfactory owing to the similar dielectric properties that exist between the crops and their surroundings. The main objective of this study was to improve the accuracy of dryland crop (maize and cotton) classification by combining multitype features and multitemporal polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images in Hebei plain, China. Three quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes were acquired between July and September 2018, from which 117 features were extracted using the Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, and multiple-component polarization decomposition methods, together with two polarization matrices (i.e., the coherency matrix and the covariance matrix). Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were used for classification of dryland crops and other land-cover types in this study. The accuracy of dryland crop classification using various single features and their combinations was compared for different imagery acquisition dates, and the performance of the two algorithms was evaluated quantitatively. The importance of all investigated features was assessed using the RF algorithm to optimize the features used and the imagery acquisition date for dryland crop classification. Results showed that the accuracy of dryland crop classification increases with evolution of the phenological period. In comparison with SVM, the RF algorithm showed better performance for dryland crop classification when using full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data. Dryland crop classification accuracy was not improved substantially when using only backscattering intensity features or polarization decomposition parameters extracted from a single-date image. Satisfactory classification accuracy was achieved using 11 optimized features (derived from the Cloude-Pottier decomposition and the coherency matrix) from 2 RADARSAT-2 images (acquisition dates corresponding to the middle and late stages of dryland crop growth). This study provides an important reference for timely and accurate classification of dryland crop in Hebei plain, China.

Anomaly maps and time profiles of remote sensing derived indicators related to crop and vegetation conditions can be accessed online thanks to a rapidly growing number of web based portals. However, timely and systematic global analysis and coherent interpretation of such information, remains challenging. With the ASAP system (Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production) we propose a two-step analysis to provide timely warning of production deficits in water-limited agricultural systems worldwide every month. The first step is fully automated and aims at classifying each sub-national administrative unit (Gaul 1 level, i.e. first sub-national level) into a number of possible warning levels, ranging from "none" to level 4 and depending on the nature and number of anomalies taken into consideration. Warnings are triggered only during the crop growing season, as derived from a remote sensing based phenology. The classification takes into consideration the fraction of the agricultural area for each Gaul 1 unit that is affected by a severe anomaly of two rainfall-based indicators and one biophysical indicator, and the timing during the growing cycle at which the anomaly occurs. Maps and summary information are published on a web GIS. The second step involves the verification of the automatic warnings by agricultural analysts to identify the countries (national level) with potentially critical conditions that are marked as "hotspots". In their evaluation, the analysts are assisted by graphs and maps automatically generated in the previous step, agriculture and food security-tailored media analysis, and the automatic detection of active crop area using high resolution imagery (e.g. Landsat 8, Sentinel 1 and 2) processed in Google Earth Engine. Maps and statistics, accompanied by short narratives are then made available on the main webpage and can be used directly by food security analysts with no specific expertise in the use of geo-spatial data, or can contribute to global early warning platforms such as the GEOGLAM Early Warning Crop Monitor, which perform monthly multi-institutional analysis of early warning information.

AB This field crop research study addresses the potential of image based remote sensing to provide spatially and temporally distributed information on timely basis for site-specific cotton crop management. Universal applicability of site specific crop management is hampered by lack of timely distributed and economically feasible information on soils and crop conditions in the field and their interaction. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate (1) how site-specific lint yield and associated soil physical properties in a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L) production field are related to changes in NDVI across the growing season, and (2) when multispectral images should be collected to optimize the cost and efficiency of remote sensing as a tool for site-specific management of the cotton crop. Temporal multispectral images data acquired comprised 10 dates (1998) and 17 dates (1999) during growing seasons, respectively with analysis focused on 24 areas of interest (AOI) (each 2 x 8 m) located in two transects on a 162-ha farm field. Along each transect, soil textural classification ranged from sandy loam to silt loam. At an early growth stage [similar to 300-600 degree days (DDs) after emergence], low NDVI and plant density were associated with soils having low saturated hydraulic conductivity (k(s)) and characterized as drainage ways. Among the AOI's, maximal NDVI was reached at approximately 1565 DD in 1998 and 1350 DD in 1999. A strong range of Pearson correlation (r(2)=0.65 - 0.83) between lint yield and NDVI during flowering stage (similar to 800-1500 DDs) supports the utility of NDVI maps for site-specific application. However, values for NDVI did not correlate well with lint yields beyond 1500 DDs [fruit (boll) opening stage] and decreased sharply on sites with sandy soil texture. Visual separation of seasonal trends in the NDVI vs. DD relationship was also related to sandy soil vs. silt loam soil texture and seasonal rainfall difference between years. Based on the statistical relationship between NDVI vs. DD it was concluded that acquisition of a single imagery during peak bloom period would be sufficient for predicting the spatial distribution of lint yield and will also be economically feasible. Results of this study indicate that spatial variability in soil physical properties induced variability in crop growth and yield. Similar methodology could be adopted for site-specific management of other crops.

AB Ridolfia segetum is a frequent umbelliferous weed in sunflower crops in the Mediterranean basin. Field and remote sensing research was conducted in 2003 and 2004 over two naturally infested fields to determine the potential of multispectral imagery for discrimination and mapping of R. segetum patches in sunflower crops. The efficiency of the four wavebands blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (NIR), selected vegetation indices and the spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification method were studied using aerial photographs taken in the late vegetative (mid-May), flowering (mid-June) and senescence (mid-July) crop growth stages. Discrimination efficiency of R. segetum patches in sunflower crops is consistently affected by their phenological stages, in this order: flowering > senescence > vegetative. In both fields, R. segetum patches were efficiently discriminated in mid-June, corresponding to the flowering phase, by using the waveband G, the ratio R/B or SAM with overall accuracies ranging from 85% to 98%. The application of the median-filtering algorithm to any of the classified images improved the accuracy. Our results suggest that mapping R. segetum weed patches in sunflower to implement site-specific weed management techniques is feasible with aerial photography when images are taken from 8 to 10 weeks before harvesting.

AB Mapping of agricultural crop types and practices is important for setting up agricultural production plans and environmental conservation measures. Sugarcane is a major tropical and subtropical crop; in general, it is grown in small fields with large spatio-temporal variations due to various crop management practices, and satellite observations of sugarcane cultivation areas are often obscured by clouds. Surface information with high spatio-temporal resolution obtained through the use of emerging satellite constellation technology can be used to track crop growth patterns with high resolution. In this study, we used Planet Dove imagery to reveal crop growth patterns and to map crop types and practices on subtropical Kumejima Island, Japan (lat. 26 degrees 21 ' 01.1 '' N, long. 126 degrees 46 ' 16.0 '' E). We eliminated misregistration between the red-green-blue (RGB) and near-infrared band imagery, and generated a time series of seven vegetation indices to track crop growth patterns. Using the Random Forest algorithm, we classified eight crop types and practices in the sugarcane. All the vegetation indices tested showed high classification accuracy, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had an overall accuracy of 0.93 and Kappa of 0.92 range of accuracy for different crop types and practices in the study area. The results for the user's and producer's accuracy of each class were good. Analysis of the importance of variables indicated that five image sets are most important for achieving high classification accuracy: Two image sets of the spring and summer sugarcane plantings in each year of a two-year observation period, and one just before harvesting in the second year. We conclude that high-temporal-resolution time series images obtained by a satellite constellation are very effective in small-scale agricultural mapping with large spatio-temporal variations.

AB This experimental study was carried out in the framework of the DUP project "Dedicated Remote Sensing Product Generation for the Agro-Industry: Cereal Case" leaded by Synoptics b.v. (NL). The main objective is to investigate the potential contribution of the ENVISAT images for the discrimination of the main crops at a regional scale. ASAR Alternating Polarisation (AP) and Wide Swath (WS) modes have been simulated from 15 ERS images over Belgium. A quantitative approach was completed using 791 parcels corresponding to the following crops: winter wheat, winter barley, spring wheat, spring barley, grasses, sugar beet, maize and potato. The impact of the spatial resolution of the ASAR sensor is assessed through the comparison of the results obtained for the AP (30m) and WS (150m) modes with regards to the field size, Both pixel-based and parcel-based unsupervised classification approaches have been applied. Dedicated interpretation schemes were developed for specific crop discrimination. The promising results obtained from the 150-m ASAR signal are expected to be further enhanced by the very high acquisition rate of the WS mode, i.e. an acquisition every 3 to 5 days.

ID CLASSIFICATION; CALIBRATION
AB We describe an application of a scale-space clustering algorithm to the classification of a multispectral and polarimetric SAR image of an agricultural site. After the initial polarimetric and radiometric calibration and noise cancellation, we extracted a 12-dimensional feature vector for each pixel from the scattering matrix. The clustering algorithm was able to partition a set of unlabeled feature vectors from 13 selected sites, each site corresponding to a distinct crop, into 13 clusters without any supervision. The cluster parameters were then used to classify the whole image. The classification map is much less noisy and more accurate than those obtained by hierarchical rules. Starting with every point as a cluster, the algorithm works by melting the system to produce a tree of clusters in the scale space. It can cluster data in any multidimensional space and is insensitive to variability in cluster densities, sizes and ellipsoidal shapes. This algorithm, more powerful than existing ones, may be useful for remote sensing for land use.

AB Cash crops are agricultural crops intended to be sold for profit as opposed to subsistence crops, meant to support the producer, or to support livestock. Since cash crops are intended for future sale, they translate into large financial value when considered on a wide geographical scale, so their production directly involves financial risk. At a national level, extreme weather events including destructive rain or hail, as well as drought, can have a significant impact on the overall economic balance. It is thus important to map such crops in order to set up insurance and mitigation strategies. Using locally generated data-such as municipality-level records of crop seeding-for mapping purposes implies facing a series of issues like data availability, quality, homogeneity, etc. We thus opted for a different approach relying on global datasets. Global datasets ensure homogeneity and availability of data, although sometimes at the expense of precision and accuracy. A typical global approach makes use of spaceborne remote sensing, for which different land cover classification strategies are available in literature at different levels of cost and accuracy. We selected the optimal strategy in the perspective of a global processing chain. Thanks to a specifically developed strategy for fusing unsupervised classification results with environmental constraints and other geospatial inputs including ground-based data, we managed to obtain good classification results despite the constraints placed. The overall production process was composed using "good-enough" algorithms at each step, ensuring that the precision, accuracy, and data-hunger of each algorithm was commensurate to the precision, accuracy, and amount of data available. This paper describes the tailored strategy developed on the occasion as a cooperation among different groups with diverse backgrounds, a strategy which is believed to be profitably reusable in other, similar contexts. The paper presents the problem, the constraints and the adopted solutions; it then summarizes the main findings including that efforts and costs can be saved on the side of Earth Observation data processing when additional ground-based data are available to support the mapping task.

AB The integration of time series of high-resolution remote sensing images in the FAO crop evapotranspiration (ET) model is receiving growing interest in the last years, specially for operational applications in irrigated areas. In this study, a simplified methodology to estimate actual ET for these areas in large watersheds was developed. Then it was applied to the Guadalquivir river watershed (Southern Spain) in the 2007 and 2008 irrigation seasons. The evolution of vegetation indices, obtained from 10 Landsat and IRS images per season, was used for two purposes. Firstly, it was used for identifying crop types based on a classification algorithm. This algorithm used training data from a screened subset of the information declared by farmers for EU agriculture subsidies purposes. Secondly, the vegetation indices were used to obtain basal crop coefficients (K-cb, the component of the crop coefficient that represents transpiration). The last step was the parameterization of the influence of evaporation from the soil surface, considering the averaged effect of a given rain distribution and irrigation schedule. The results showed only small discrepancies between the crop coefficients calculated using the simplified model and those calculated based on a soil water balance and the dual approach proposed by FAO. Therefore, it was concluded that the simplified method can be applied to large irrigation areas where detailed information about soils and/or water applied by farmers lacks.

AB In this research, we compared two different sets of land surface phenological metrics (phenometrics) derived from dense satellite image time series to classify agricultural land in the Cerrado biome. We derived phenometrics from a dense Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data cube with an 8-day temporal resolution and subjected them to classification using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. We then evaluated the classification results comparing the use of phenometrics extracted using TIMESAT software [1], those obtained by polar representation, proposed by Korting et al. (2013) and the combination of both. We concluded that the accuracies of semi-perennial and winter crop classes increase substantially when using TIMESAT metrics combined with Polar features, and the misclassifications between single crops with non commercial crops are reduced.

AB High spatial resolution imagery from recently launched satellite sensors offers new opportunities for crop management. The objective of this study was to evaluate QuickBird satellite imagery for mapping yield variability in cotton fields. A QuickBird image scene with 2.8 m resolution and four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared) was acquired from an intensively cropped area in south Texas. Airborne color-infrared imagery was also collected from two cotton fields within the satellite scene. Yield data were collected from the two fields using a cotton yield monitor Images for the two fields were extracted from the QuickBird scene, and both the satellite and airborne images were aggregated to a pixel resolution of 8.4 m, about twice the harvester swath. Vegetation indices including band ratios and normalized differences were calculated from the spectral bands, and cotton yield was related to the bands and vegetation indices for both types of imagery. The extracted QuickBird images were classified into two to ten zones using unsupervised classification, and mean yields among the zones were compared. Results showed that cotton yield was correlated to both types of imagery and that the QuickBird imagery had similar correlations with yield to the airborne imagery. Moreover, the unsupervised classification maps effectively differentiated cotton production levels among the zones. These results indicate that high spatial resolution satellite imagery can be a useful data source for estimating crop yield.

AB The increasing volume of remote sensing data with improved spatial and temporal resolutions generates unique opportunities for monitoring and mapping of crops. We compared multiple single-band and multi-band object-based time-constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) classifications for crop mapping based on Sentinel-2 time series of vegetation indices. We tested it on two complex and intensively managed agricultural areas in California and Texas. DTW is a time-flexible method for comparing two temporal patterns by considering their temporal distortions in their alignment. For crop mapping, using time constraints in computing DTW is recommended in order to consider the seasonality of crops. We tested different time constraints in DTW (15, 30, 45, and 60 days) and compared the results with those obtained by using Euclidean distance or a DTW without time constraint. Best classification results were for time delays of both 30 and 45 days in California: 79.5% for single-band DTWs and 85.6% for multi-band DTWs. In Texas, 45 days was best for single-band DTW (89.1%), while 30 days yielded best results for multi-band DTW (87.6%). Using temporal information from five vegetation indices instead of one increased the overall accuracy in California with 6.1%. We discuss the implications of DTW dissimilarity values in understanding the classification errors. Considering the possible sources of errors and their propagation throughout our analysis, we had combined errors of 22.2% and 16.8% for California and 24.6% and 25.4% for Texas study areas. The proposed workflow is the first implementation of DTW in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) environment and represents a promising step towards generating fast, accurate, and ready-to-use agricultural data products.

AB Crop monitoring and phenology estimation based on the satellite systems have become an important research area due to high demand on crops. Satellites with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor are highly preferred on such studies because of not only their day/night and all weather acquisition capabilities but also their ability to detect small morphological changes in monitored target, regarding the wavelength of signals. Besides, thanks to the high temporal resolution of new generation space-based sensors, it has been possible to monitor growth cycle of crops by classification algorithms. This paper focused on building a feasible phenology classification schema for paddy-rice using multitemporal co-polar TerraSAR-X images. Phenology classification was conducted with support vector machines (SVM) with linear and nonlinear kernel, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and decision trees (DT). The key implementation challenges such as the number of classes, the identification of the boundaries of the classes, and the selection of textural and polarimetric features were deeply analyzed. According to all the evaluations conducted, the classification schema was finalized to be used for obtaining thematic maps for two independent rice-cultivated agricultural areas located in Spain and Turkey. The results of these experiments enable one to draw a conclusion about feasibility of machine learning (ML) algorithms in operational phenology monitoring.

AB The performance of image classification is highly dependent on the quality of extracted features. Concerning high resolution remote image images, encoding the spatial features in an efficient and robust fashion is the key to generating discriminatory models to classify them. Even though many visual descriptors have been proposed or successfully used to encode spatial features of remote sensing images, some applications, using this sort of images, demand more specific description techniques. Deep Learning, an emergent machine learning approach based on neural networks, is capable of learning specific features and classifiers at the same time and adjust at each step, in real time, to better fit the need of each problem. For several task, such image classification, it has achieved very good results, mainly boosted by the feature learning performed which allows the method to extract specific and adaptable visual features depending on the data. In this paper, we propose a novel network capable of learning specific spatial features from remote sensing images, with any pre-processing step or descriptor evaluation, and classify them. Specifically, automatic feature learning task aims at discovering hierarchical structures from the raw data, leading to a more representative information. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for urban planning, crop and forest management and climate modelling. The propose convolutional neural network has six layers: three convolutional, two fully-connected and one classifier layer. So, the five first layers are responsible to extract visual features while the last one is responsible to classify the images. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using two datasets: (i) the popular aerial image dataset UCMerced Land-use and, (ii) a multispectral high-resolution scenes of the Brazilian Coffee Scenes. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overall accuracy.

AB This study addressed the classification of multi-temporal satellite data from RapidEye by considering different classifier algorithms and decision fusion. Four non-parametric classifier algorithms, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were applied to map crop types in various irrigated landscapes in Central Asia. A novel decision fusion strategy to combine the outputs of the classifiers was proposed. This approach is based on randomly selecting subsets of the input dataset and aggregating the probabilistic outputs of the base classifiers with another meta-classifier. During the decision fusion, the reliability of each base classifier algorithm was considered to exclude less reliable inputs at the class-basis. The spatial and temporal transferability of the classifiers was evaluated using data sets from four different agricultural landscapes with different spatial extents and from different years. A detailed accuracy assessment showed that none of the stand-alone classifiers was the single best performing. Despite the very good performance of the base classifiers, there was still up to 50% disagreement in the maps produced by the two single best classifiers, RF and SVM. The proposed fusion strategy, however, increased overall accuracies up to 6%. In addition, it was less sensitive to reduced training set sizes and produced more realistic land use maps with less speckle. The proposed fusion approach was better transferable to data sets from other years, i.e. resulted in higher accuracies for the investigated classes. The fusion approach is computationally efficient and appears well suited for mapping diverse crop categories based on sensors with a similar high repetition rate and spatial resolution like RapidEye, for instance the upcoming Sentinel-2 mission.

AB The development and improvement of methods to map agricultural land cover are currently major challenges, especially for radar images. This is due to the speckle noise nature of radar, leading to a less intensive use of radar rather than optical images. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 constellation, which recently became operational, is a satellite system providing global coverage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with a 6-days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of about 20 m. These data are valuable, as they provide spatial information on agricultural crops. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for agricultural land cover mapping through the use of deep learning techniques. The analysis is carried out on multitemporal Sentinel-1 data over an area in Camargue, France. The data set was processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from May 2017 to September 2017. We improved this radar time series dataset by exploiting temporal filtering to reduce noise, while retaining as much as possible the fine structures present in the images. We revealed that even with classical machine learning approaches (K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines), good performance classification could be achieved with F-measure/Accuracy greater than 86% and Kappa coefficient better than 0.82. We found that the results of the two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers clearly outperformed the classical approaches. Finally, our analyses of the Camargue area results show that the same performance was obtained with two different RNN-based classifiers on the Rice class, which is the most dominant crop of this region, with a F-measure metric of 96%. These results thus highlight that in the near future these RNN-based techniques will play an important role in the analysis of remote sensing time series.

AB The development of precision agriculture puts forward higher requirements for the construction of an ecological irrigation area, some of which are the control of crop risk and the good circulation of the environment. In this paper, a method for extracting crops and weeds using remote sensing images of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed. The main three crops (wheat, peanut, maize) and three weeds (Chenopodium album, Humulus scandens, Xanthium sibiricum Patrin ex Widder) in the ecological irrigation area are collected by UAV. By manual labeling, 2,287 training sets and 979 test sets are formed. AlexNet, a transfer neural network, is trained in a single central processing unit (CPU), single graphics processing unit (GPU), and double GPUs to test the complexity of the algorithm. The classification results show that the accuracy of the Chenopodium album is 100%, Humulus scandensis 99.07%, Xanthium sibiricum Patrin ex Widder is 100%, wheat is 99.49%, peanut is 100%, and maize is 99.05%. The overall accuracy rate is 99.69%. The method proposed in this paper can accurately extract crops and weeds and calculate the quantity. The density of each weed can also be calculated in conjunction with the proposed density calculation method. It can provide a reference for the precise application of pesticides, thereby improving crop risk management capabilities.

AB Plastic mulching has been widely practiced in crop cultivation worldwide due to its potential to significantly increase crop production. However, it also has a great impact on the regional climate and ecological environment. More importantly, it often leads to unexpected soil pollution due to fine plastic residuals. Therefore, accurately and timely monitoring of the temporal and spatial distribution of plastic mulch practice in large areas is of great interest to assess its impacts. However, existing plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) detecting efforts are limited to either small areas with high-resolution images or coarse resolution images of large areas. In this study, we examined the potential of cloud computing and multi-temporal, multi-sensor satellite images for detecting PMF in large areas. We first built the plastic-mulched farmland mapping algorithm (PFMA) rules through analyzing its spectral, temporal, and auxiliary features in remote sensing imagery with the classification and regression tree (CART). We then applied the PFMA in the dry region of Xinjiang, China, where a water resource is very scarce and thus plastic mulch has been intensively used and its usage is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The experimental results demonstrated that the PFMA reached an overall accuracy of 92.2% with a producer's accuracy of 97.6% and a user's accuracy of 86.7%, and the F-score was 0.914 for the PMF class. We further monitored and analyzed the dynamics of plastic mulch practiced in Xinjiang by applying the PFMA to the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The general pattern of plastic mulch usage dynamic in Xinjiang during the period from 2000 to 2015 was well captured by our multi-temporal analysis.

DE grasslands; multi-seasonal; bio-physical parameters
AB Grasslands cover about 40 % of the earth's surface [1]. Due to its great expanse and diversity, low-cost tools for inventory, management and monitoring are needed. Remote sensing is a useful technique for providing accurate and reliable information for land use planning and to support large scale grassland management. In the context of "GIO land" (Copernicus initial operations land), which is currently implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) the permanent grasslands of 39 countries in Europe has to be mapped with an overall classification accuracy of more than 80 % [2]. Since grassland canopy density, chlorophyll status and ground cover is highly dynamic throughout the growing season, no unique spectral signature can be used to map grasslands. Therefore, it is necessary to use time series to characterize the phenological dynamics of grasslands throughout the year to be able to discriminate among them and other vegetation which shows similar spectral response such as crops. The article outlines the adopted classification method using multi-temporal, multi-scale and multi-source remotely sensed data. The approach is based on the supervised decision Tree (DT) classifier C5 in combination with previous image segmentation and seasonal statistics of bio-physical parameters. In this paper the results of entire Hungary are presented. The accuracy assessment of the grassland classification was carried out using 340 sample points derived from a ground-based European field survey program. The multi-temporal grassland classification of Hungary reached an overall accuracy of 92.2 %.

DE Temporal classification; crop classification; land use
AB Use of temporal signatures to classify the complex land use patterns in Canterbury New Zealand is investigated. Two datasets of detailed field histories spanning 5-7 years are used to develop a rule set for classifying from satellite imagery (SPOT/Landsat). While many individual crops proved inseparable, a broader set of land use classes such as 'winter forage' or 'summer arable crop' were defined that could be separated with accuracies between 71% and 96% (averaging 82% over 8 classifications). These broader land use classes will be used in a second stage of the project to guide and constrain classifications incorporating spectral information from the crop's peak NDVI phase.

ID LAND
AB The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used remote sensing indicator for crop growth monitoring, farmland management and crop production prediction. Traditional monitoring methods that are based on the NDVI difference (dNDVI) are sensitive to variations in the crop growth status in the reference year and to the classification standard to obtain crop growth "grades", however, they are only applicable for the same crop area. To overcome this limitation, this study developed a new approach that is based on crop NDVI percentiles (pNDVI) for real-time monitoring of crop growth. The method utilizes NDVI data for the same day in the past five years over the same region and is based on crop distribution maps of these years, thereby creating a large sample of crop NDVI. According to the lookup table for each NDVI and its percentile (P%), which were retrieved from this sample, the current NDVI value is converted to its P and used for real-time growth evaluation, and the P score indicates that the growth of the crop at this pixel on the monitoring day is better than the P% of the crops for the whole monitoring region over the last 5 years. This approach was applied and validated for a representative agricultural region in the North China Plain (NCP), and winter wheat was used as the test crop. The results were satisfactory, with a significant and sound correlation between the scores that were obtained by the pNDVI method and the sampled winter wheat aboveground biomass. The correlation was higher for the pNDVI compared to dNDVI, although the correlation was significant for both methods.

AB Rice is the staple food for half of the world's population. Therefore, accurate information of rice area is vital for food security. This study investigates the effect of phenology for rice mapping using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. Crop phenology is combined with high spatial resolution multispectral data to accurately classify the rice. Phenology was used to capture the seasonal dynamics of the crops, while multispectral data provided the spatial variation patterns. Phenology was extracted from MODIS NDVI time series, and the distribution of rice was mapped from China's Environmental Satellite (HJ-1A/B) data. Classification results were evaluated by a confusion matrix using 100 sample points. The overall accuracy of the resulting map of rice area generated by both spectral and phenology is 93%. The results indicate that the use of phenology improved the overall classification accuracy from 2%-4%. The comparison between the estimated rice areas and the State's statistics shows underestimated values with a percentage difference of -34.53%. The results highlight the potential of the combined use of crop phenology and multispectral satellite data for accurate rice classification in a large area.

AB This paper presents the application of Neural Networks and Singular Value Decomposition to agricultural land use classification.
   Neural Networks (NN) have been found to have good generalization properties [1] and their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in the field of remote sensing [2]. However, there are a number of problems where neural networks do not necessarily provide an optimum solution, these include mixed pixel analysis, sub-class characterization and parameter extraction for use in bio-physical models. Typically the application of NN techniques to remote sensing involves using one NN to classify a large number of land-cover classes [3]. The authors have found this approach to be inefficient and inaccurate, a modular approach is therefore implemented which is more flexible. SVD has previously been used to classify agricultural species with accuracy's approaching 95% and has also been used to characterise subclasses of Winter Wheat [4]. SVD and key vector analysis also enable parameters such as yield to be directly correlated with the output vectors. A holistic classification process has been developed by the author's which uses the best elements from neural networks and SVD.
   This paper applies these techniques to optical airborne data at varying resolution from Im to 5m resolution. The area used for this work is a research farm in Bavaria, Germany, which comprises of a highly dynamic terrain with small field units. High resolution land-use maps and yield data have been produced for the research farm, using GPS equipment attached to crop harvesters. These maps are used to validate the results produced by the various techniques.

AB Crop type classification is critical for crop production estimation and optimal water allocation. Crop type data are challenging to generate if crop reference data are lacking, especially for target years with reference data missed in collection. Is it possible to transfer a trained crop type classification model to retrace the historical spatial distribution of crop types? Taking the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in China as the study area, this study first designed a 10 m crop type classification framework based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for crop type mapping in the current season. Then, its interannual transferability to accurately retrace historical crop distributions was tested. The framework used Sentinel-1/2 data as the satellite data source, combined percentile, and monthly composite approaches to generate classification metrics and employed a random forest classifier with 300 trees for crop classification. Based on the proposed framework, this study first developed a 10 m crop type map of the HID for 2020 with an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.89 and then obtained a 10 m crop type map of the HID for 2019 with an OA of 0.92 by transferring the trained model for 2020 without crop reference samples. The results indicated that the designed framework could effectively identify HID crop types and have good transferability to obtain historical crop type data with acceptable accuracy. Our results found that SWIR1, Green, and Red Edge2 were the top three reflectance bands for crop classification. The land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were the top three vegetation indices for crop classification. April to August was the most suitable time window for crop type classification in the HID. Sentinel-1 information played a positive role in the interannual transfer of the trained model, increasing the OA from 90.73% with Sentinel 2 alone to 91.58% with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 together.

AB A country's food needs mainly depend upon its agriculture resources and require reliable information related to crop health, distribution, and acreage estimation to manage and monitor resources to implement a sustainable agricultural system. Different methodologies have been used to collect this information. However, the availability of earth resource satellite data with improved spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, such as the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program satellites Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), are creating more practicability to generate crop type maps. S1 and S2, both operating in a constellation of twin satellites, carry a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multispectral Instrument (MSI). Vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH), and vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) channels of S1 were used to exploit the temporal backscatter of crops present in the study area. In this research, a machine learning random forest classification algorithm is used for accurate crop type mapping through the combination of SAR (S1) and optical (S2) time-series data. Random forest classifier has produced considerable improved accuracies of crop type mapping in previous studies as it uses ensemble decision trees trained on sample data which permit the vote in favor of the most popular land use/ land cover class. The key objectives of this study are to investigate the classification accuracies for different data combinations. Three plots of data are tested (i) S1 (ii) S2 (iii) S1 & S2. A combination of SAR and optical data turn out with the best overall accuracy of 97% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. Space-borne SAR and optical data add a new aspect of crop type mapping, which increases the classification accuracy by including valuable parameters and beating the drawbacks of each other. By comparing the results, it can be concluded that combining all-weather accessible SAR and spectrally rich optical data accomplished more accurate outcomes. It would be an imperative advance for the future endeavor to estimate crop biomass and biophysical parameters. (c) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ERS-1 SAR; SIGNATURES
AB Multispectral optical remote-sensing systems have been the base for crop identification and monitoring for many years. However, cloud cover limits and even prevents the use of optical data for this activity. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide an interesting alternative to conventional multispectral classification schemes. Radar sensors can acquire data regardless of cloud cover, and their observations provide complementary information to that captured by optical sensors. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate whether the incorporation of polarimetric SAR observations to a multispectral classification scheme enhances classification results using the proposed method. With this aim, one Landsat thematic mapper scene and two ALOS/PALSAR quadrature polarization scenes acquired in 2007 were processed. The results demonstrated the ability of SAR data to improve the classification based on optical images. However, improvements were slight (an increase of around 2% in the classification's overall accuracy). The results improved significantly when barley, wheat, and oats were considered a single class, called cereals. The best results were achieved using Landsat and the two ALOS/PALSAR scenes together, obtaining an overall Kappa coefficient and accuracy of 0.67 and 90%, respectively. Probably, scenes acquired on other dates (June and July) would have yielded clearer classification enhancements.

AB The Atlantic rainforest of southern Babia is one of the last remnants of the lowland forest of eastern Brazil that once covered The entire coastal area from Rio Grande do Norte to Rio Grande do Sul (lat 8 degrees 28 degreesS) and bas been deforested to a small fraction of its original cover (1-12%). All recent vegetation surveys have been based on optic il satellite data, which is hampered by cloud cover and by southern Bahia's intricate mix of forest patches with other tree crops, especially cocoa. We describe the application of radar remote-sensing data to distinguish forest patches from cocoa planted in the shade of natural-forest trees, Radar, unlike optical sensors, is not obstructed by cloud cover and can acquire information about-forest structure by penetrating into the vegetation canopy The vegetation map generated from radar data clearly separates forest patches based on the degree of structural disturbance such as the density of shaded trees, the openness of the canopy, and the density of the monodominant Erythyrina shaded trees. The structural classification based on the radar data, and shown on the map, can help researchers assess the degree of fragmentation of the original Atlantic coastal forest and delineate areas of less disturbance with higher potential for conservation of biodiversity. This information can then be applied to conservation planning, especially the design and monitoring of nature reserves and the modeling of biological corridors.

AB Wild Rice (Zizania aquatica) is a primary staple for Native Americans in the northern United States and there is a strong need to timely map and monitor its production on American Indian Reservations. This paper describes a methodology for the detection and classification of wild rice using satellite remotes sensing. Landsat-7 data were used to map and estimate wild rice crop areas for the Leech Lake American Indian Reservation in Minnesota. A 14 band dataset was created using bands 1-5 and 7 from Landsat-7 images for July and October, 1999. Two additional bands of image texture were also created from the 15 meter panchromatic channel of Landsat-7 for each time period and added to the dataset. Since wild rice grows in standing water, a data transform was developed to identify wet vegetation in the dataset. The data transform was created from the multi-temporal dataset and based on a minimum noise fraction transformation, image textural analysis, and hierarchical data masking. A lake and water mask was created and applied to the image to isolate wild rice beds from the wet vegetation transform. Training data for wild rice were collected using a GPS mounted to a laptop computer containing the image data. A spectral matched filtering algorithm was then applied to the image transform using ground collected data to classify wild rice within the data mask. Final classified data were verified using wild rice data collected in the field and from aerial photographs. We estimated nearly 2000 hectares of wild rice available for harvest for 1999 within the boundaries of the Leech Lake American Indian Reservation. This is over a 65% decrease in crop area of wild rice from 1994 (5750 hectares). We were able to verify the 1999 crop loss and subsequent insurance claim for the Leech Lake American Indian Reservation. Such mapping with Landsat-7 provides a more accurate wild rice database than can be routinely updated with repeat Landsat-7 coverage.

AB Automatic object detection from remote sensing images has attracted a significant attention due to its importance in both military and civilian fields. However, the low confidence of the candidates restricts the recognition of potential objects, and the unreasonable predicted boxes result in false positives (FPs). To address these issues, an accurate and fast object detection method called the refined single-shot multibox detector (RSSD) is proposed, consisting of a single-shot multibox detector (SSD), a refined network (RefinedNet), and a class-specific spatial template matching (STM) module. In the training stage, fed with augmented samples in diverse variation, the SSD can efficiently extract multiscale features for object classification and location. Meanwhile, RefinedNet is trained with cropped objects from the training set to further enhance the ability to distinguish each class of objects and the background. Class-specific spatial templates are also constructed from the statistics of objects of each class to provide reliable object templates. During the test phase, RefinedNet improves the confidence of potential objects from the predicted results of SSD and suppresses that of the background, which promotes the detection rate. Furthermore, several grotesque candidates are rejected by the well-designed class-specific spatial templates, thus reducing the false alarm rate. These three parts constitute a monolithic architecture, which contributes to the detection accuracy and maintains the speed. Experiments on high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images of satellites GaoFen-2 and JiLin-1 demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed modules and the whole framework.

AB Early identification of cotton fields is important for advancing boll weevil eradication progress and reducing the risk of reinfestation. Remote sensing has long been used for crop identification, but limited work has been reported on early identification of cotton fields. The objective of this study is to evaluate aerial imagery for identifying cotton fields before cotton plants start to bloom. A two-camera imaging system was used to acquire red-green-blue and near-infrared images with 1-m pixel resolution along two flight lines over an 8 km x 12 km cropping area. The images were mosaicked using two approaches: manual georeferencing followed by position-based mosaicking in Erdas Imagine and content-based automatic mosaicking in Pix4DMapper. The mosaicked images were then classified into different crops and cover types using supervised classification techniques. Results showed that both types of mosaics were effective for cotton identification and that maximum likelihood classification produced the best overall accuracy of 90% for the position-based approach and 91% for the content-based approach. The methodologies presented in this study will be useful for boll weevil eradication program managers to quickly and efficiently identify cotton fields at relatively early growth stages using mosaicked aerial imagery.

TI Land use change and crop rotation analysis of a government well district
   in Rashda village - Dakhla Oasis, Egypt based on satellite data
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
LA English

AB Dakhla Oasis is located in the heart of the Western Desert of Egypt 190 km to the West of the Kharga Oasis where it contains highly fertile lands rich in water and it supports a higher population compared to the Kharga Oasis. The study area is mainly concentrated in the Rashda village where Well No. 3 Irrigation District is located to the northwest of the village.
   Satellite imageries of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 1972 and 1984, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) 1988, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 2000 were used to determine the change in landuse and change in elevation with its relation to landuse. The automated unsupervised classification technique was applied to delineate the different landuse classes. Landsat -5/TM and Landsat -7/ETM + images in the period between 2001 and 2010 have been used to study crop rotation at the Rashda village to detect the amount of vegetation cover and its condition in the Well No. 3 district.
   The land use change analysis showed that the extension of cultivated land was already completed by the 1980s in the North and South subdistricts, after which it spread toward the West. Because the altitude in the West subdistrict is lower than the wells, irrigation water could be distributed adequately if the condition of the irrigation channel was well maintained. The relationship between the irrigation level and plant production was not favorable in the West compared with other subdistricts. The cultivated area in the West district has been increasing since the 1970s. According to the crop rotation analysis, the different productivity of the subdistricts was caused by several factors, including the land altitude and the distance from the well, as well as other factors such as social relationships in the village.

AB The mapping and monitoring of natural and semi-natural habitats are crucial activities and are regulated by European policies and regulations, such as the 92/43/EEC. In the Mediterranean area, which is characterized by high vegetational and environmental diversity, the mapping and monitoring of habitats are particularly difficult and often exclusively based on in situ observations. In this scenario, it is necessary to automate the generation of updated maps to support the decisions of policy makers. At present, the availability of high spatiotemporal resolution data provides new possibilities for improving the mapping and monitoring of habitats. In this work, we present a methodology that, starting from remotely sensed time-series data, generates habitat maps using supervised classification supported by Functional Data Analysis. We constructed the methodology using Sentinel-2 data in the Mediterranean Special Area of Conservation "Gola di Frasassi" (Code: IT5320003). In particular, the training set uses 308 field plots with 11 target classes (five forests, two shrubs, one grassland, one mosaic, one extensive crop, and one urban land). Starting from vegetation index time-series data, Functional Principal Component Analysis was applied to derive FPCA scores and components. In particular, in the classification stage, the FPCA scores are considered as features. The obtained results out-performed a previous map derived from photo-interpretation by domain experts. We obtained an overall accuracy of 85.58% using vegetation index time-series, topography, and lithology data. The main advantages of the proposed approach are the capability to efficiently compress high dimensional data (dense remote-sensing time series) providing results in a compact way (e.g., FPCA scores and mean seasonal time profiles) that: (i) facilitate the link between remote sensing with habitat mapping and monitoring and their ecological interpretation and (ii) could be complementary to species-based approaches in plant community ecology and phytosociology.

AB Water! As correctly said is the life for all living things. It is the most precious resource on this earth, which is, under threat of overuse and pollution. Water pollution is of great concern to everybody since it shows direct impact on human health. Two broad categories of water pollution vis-A-vis point and non-point are expanding enormously in terms of time and space. Agriculture is one of the main activities contributing to non-point Source Pollution (NPS) of water bodies in India as well as over the globe. In this context, a mathematical modeling study coupled with Remote Sensing (RS) Analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping was attempted for Nagpur District of Maharashtra State in India. Satellite image of IRS-P6 LISS III data was classified using supervised classification algorithm to map major landuse classes in the study area. The numerical data on type of crop grown, area under each crop, cropping pattern, nutrient requirement of crop, fertilizer used, soil type and rainfall was obtained from secondary sources. Mathematical computations were done for total amount of fertilizer N:P:K applied in two cropping seasons viz. Kharif (from June to November) and Rabi (from December to May). Considering the overall fate of nitrogen fertilizer as reported to be 30 to 70% -removed in harvested crop, 5 to 10% - leaching loss, 10 to 30% -gaseous loss, and 10 to 40% - incorporated into soil organic matter; the nutrient remaining in the soil were estimated. The NPS loading from agricultural land which is available for wash off and gets transported with runoff were estimated by simulating the monthly lodographs in terms of N and P. Runoff estimation was landuse-specific and only runoff generated from agricultural land was considered for load estimation. Results indicated that out of thirteen tehsils (small administrative units), maximum runoff was generated from Narkher telisil and the nutrient removal was 22.6% N and 59.2% P. GIS-mapping of buffer zone of 2km distance around each water body and overlaying of slope map was performed to identify the water resources that are likely to receive pollution load vis-A-vis environmental threat. The remaining load which would accumulate onto the land or drainage was categorized as environmental burden. The estimated environmental burden and environmental threat can form basis in formulation of guidelines for structural and non-structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water pollution control within the administrative boundary.

AB The rapid development of remote sensing (RS) technology enables an increased usage of high - resolution, spatial, temporal or spectral, data to extract vegetation information, improve model parameters, and estimate energy crop biomass accurately. Five estimation methods developing with RS information for energy crop biomass are summarized in this paper. Firstly, the statistical analysis with vegetation index can be regarded as the commonest method. But it is faulted for the deficiency of sample data and the vulnerability to the influence of many factors such as cloudy days. Secondly, the longer wavelength makes SAR information popular for crop biomass estimation. But many limitations lead to measurement uncertainty and bring about poor classification. Thirdly, NPP can directly reflect accumulated biomass production through photosynthesis and measure the consequences caused by climate change and human activities. But, actual LUE, the results of environmental stresses such as light intensity, temperature, water, and nutrients, is usually considered as a constant. Fourthly, crop height information is vitally important for biomass estimation. Yet the corresponding application is often subject to many factors e.g. crop variety, growth period, and farmland management practices limits. Lastly, the most promising approach lies in the possibility of assimilating state variables from RS data into CGMs. And the advent of latest instruments with better characteristics offer a unique chance to overcome current limitations. In the end, the main challenges and opportunities for energy crop biomass estimation using RS information in the future are listed.

AB Farmland parcel-based crop classification using satellite data plays an important role in precision agriculture. In this study, a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method employing optical images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is presented for crop classification for cloudy and rainy regions. Central to this method is the spatial-temporal incorporation of high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal SAR data and deep-learning-based time-series analysis. First, a precise farmland parcel map is delineated from high-resolution optical images. Second, pre-processed SAR intensity images are overlaid onto the parcel map to construct time series of crop growth for each parcel. Third, a deep-learning-based (using the long short-term memory, LSTM, network) classifier is employed to learn time-series features of crops and to classify parcels to produce a final classification map. The method was applied to two datasets of high-resolution ZY-3 images and multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data to classify crop types in Hunan and Guizhou of China. The classification results, with an 5.0% improvement in overall accuracy compared to those of traditional methods, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for parcel-based crop classification for southern China. A further analysis of the relationship between crop calendars and change patterns of time-series intensity indicates that the LSTM model could learn and extract useful features for time-series crop classification.

AB The growing population in China has led to an increasing importance of crop area (CA) protection. A powerful tool for acquiring accurate and up-to-date CA maps is automatic mapping using information extracted from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) images. RS image information extraction includes feature classification, which is a long-standing research issue in the RS community. Emerging deep learning techniques, such as the deep semantic segmentation network technique, are effective methods to automatically discover relevant contextual features and get better image classification results. In this study, we exploited deep semantic segmentation networks to classify and extract CA from high-resolution RS images. WorldView-2 (WV-2) images with only Red-Green-Blue (RGB) bands were used to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed semantic classification framework for information extraction and the CA mapping task. Specifically, we used the deep learning framework TensorFlow to construct a platform for sampling, training, testing, and classifying to extract and map CA on the basis of DeepLabv3+. By leveraging per-pixel and random sample point accuracy evaluation methods, we conclude that the proposed approach can efficiently obtain acceptable accuracy (Overall Accuracy = 95%, Kappa = 0.90) of CA classification in the study area, and the approach performs better than other deep semantic segmentation networks (U-Net/PspNet/SegNet/DeepLabv2) and traditional machine learning methods, such as Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and RF (Random Forest). Furthermore, the proposed approach is highly scalable for the variety of crop types in a crop area. Overall, the proposed approach can train a precise and effective model that is capable of adequately describing the small, irregular fields of smallholder agriculture and handling the great level of details in RGB high spatial resolution images.

AB Monitoring crop leaf area index (LAI) timely and accurately by remote sensing is crucial to assess crop growth, manage field water-fertilizer and predict yield. The Huaihe River Basin was chose as study area to carry out field survey. By using decision tree classification and HJ-1/2 CCD image, the spatial distribution of paddy was identified. The extinction coefficient of paddy surface was confirmed with in-situ samples. The Beer-Lambert law was introduced to develop the inversion model of paddy LAI. The accuracy of inversion model was evaluated with in-situ samples, including coefficient of determination (R-2), RMSE and overall accuracy, while contrasting with the model of single-variable and multi-variables. Results showed that the inversion model based on Beer-Lambert law reached highest accuracy with the average R-2 of 0.684 and the average RMSE of 0.592. The average R-2 of multi-variables was 0.636, while the average RMSE was 0.661. The model of single-variable has lowest accuracy with average R-2 of 0.595 and average RMSE of 0.732. It indicated that the retrieval accuracy of LAI was improved with more variables inputted. The model based on Beer-Lambert law simulated the physical process of radiative transfer of paddy that differed from the two other models. The overall accuracy of Beer-Lambert law model exceeded 95 percent, while those of the two other models were 91.0 percent and 88.2 percent respectively. So the inversion model of paddy LAI based on Beer-Lambert law could eliminate the influence of water background and improve the accuracy of paddy LAI by remote sensing.

AB Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.

AB Since the mid-2000s, agricultural lands in the United States have been undergoing rapid change to meet the increasing bioenergy demand. In 2009 the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was estab-lished. In its Project Area 1, land owners are financially supported to grow perennial prairie grasses (switchgrass) in their row-crop lands. To promote the program, this study tested the feasibility of bio-mass crop mapping based on unique timings of crop development. With a previously published data fusion algorithm- the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), a 10-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series in 2007 was established by fusing MODIS reflectance into TM image series. Two critical dates- peak growing (PG) and peak drying (PD)-were extracted and a unique "PG-0-PD" timing sequence was defined for each crop. With a knowledge-based decision tree approach, the classification of enhanced TM/MODIS time series reached an overall accuracy of 76% against the USDA Crop Data layer (CDL). Especially, our results showed that winter wheat single cropping and wheat-soybean double cropping were much better classified, which may provide additional information for the CDL product. More importantly, this study extracted the first spatial layer of warm-season prairie grasses that have not been published in any national land cover products, which could serve as a base map for decision making of bioenergy land use in BCAP land.

AB Bananas and plantains provide food and income for more than 50 million smallholder farmers in East and Central African (ECA) countries. However, banana productivity generally achieves less than optimal yield potential ( < 30%) in most regions, including Uganda. Numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the key challenges that smallholder banana growers face at different stages of the banana value chain, with one of the main constraints being a lack of policy-relevant agricultural data. The World Bank (WB) initiated a methodological survey design aimed at identifying the distribution of banana varieties across a number of key Ugandan growing regions, at the individual household scale. To achieve this outcome a number of approaches including ground-based surveys, DNA tissue collection of selected banana plants and remote sensing were evaluated. For the remote sensing component, the set objectives were to develop statistical models from the hyperspectral reflectance properties of individual leaves that could differentiate typical ECA banana varieties, as well as their parentage (usage). The study also explored the potential of extrapolating the ground-based hyperspectral measures to high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery, therefore creating the potential of mapping the distribution of banana varieties at a regional scale. The DNA testing of 43 banana varieties propagated at the National Banana Research Program site at National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) research station in Kampala, Uganda, identified 12 genetically different varieties. A canonical powered partial least square (CPPLS) model developed from hyperspectral reflectance properties of the sampled banana leaves successfully differentiated BLU, BOG, GON, GRO and KAY genotypes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was also evaluated to determine if spectral bands coinciding with those provided by WV3 data could segregate banana varieties. The results suggested that this was achievable and as such presents an opportunity to extrapolate the hyperspectral classifications to broader areas of land. The ability to spectrally differentiate these five genotypes has merit as they are not typical east African varieties. As such, identifying the distribution and density of these varieties across Uganda provides vital information to the banana breeders of NARO of where their new varieties are being disseminated too, data that has been previously difficult to obtain. Although the results from this pilot study indicated that not all banana varieties could be spectrally differentiated, the methodology developed and the positive results that were achieved do present remote sensing as a complimentary technology to the ongoing surveying of banana and other crop types grown within Ugandan household farming systems.

AB Oil palm is recognized as a golden crop, as it produces the highest oil yield among oil seed crops. Malaysia is the world's second largest producer of palm oil; 16% of its land is planted with oil palm. To cope with the ever-increasing global demand on edible oil, additional areas of oil palm are forecast to increase globally by 12 to 19 Mha by 2050. Multisensor remote sensing plays an important role in providing relevant, timely, and accurate information that can be developed into a plantation monitoring system to optimize production and sustainability. The aim of this study was to simultaneously exploit the synthetic aperture radar ALOS PALSAR 2, a form of microwave remote sensing, in combination with visible (red) data from Landsat Thematic Mapper to obtain a holistic view of a plantation. A manipulation of the horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (HV) polarizations of ALOS PALSAR data detected oil palm trees and water bodies, while the red spectra L-band from Landsat data (optical) could effectively identify built up areas and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization from Sentinel C-band data detected bare land. These techniques produced an oil palm area classification with overall accuracies of 98.36% and 0.78 kappa coefficient for Peninsular Malaysia. The total oil palm area in Peninsular Malaysia was estimated to be about 3.48% higher than the value reported by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. The over estimation may be due the MPOB's statistics that do not include unregistered small holder oil palm plantations. In this study, we were able to discriminate most of the rubber areas.

DE crop classification; Mongolia; TM; multi-temporal images
ID MASKING CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; IMAGES
AB Although the need of crop production has increased in Mongolia, crop cultivation is very limited because of the harsh climatic and topographic conditions. Crop lands are sparsely distributed with relatively small sizes and, therefore, it is difficult to survey the exact area of crop lands. The study aimed to find an easy and effective way of accurate classification to map crop lands in Mongolia using satellite images. To classify the crop lands over the study area in northern Mongolia, four classifications were carried out by using 1) Thematic Mapper (TM) image August 23, 2) TM image of July 6, 3) combined 12 bands of TM images of July and August, and 4) both TM images of July and August by layered classification. Wheat and potato are the major crop types and they show relatively high variation in crop conditions between July and August. On the other hands, other land cover types (forest, riparian vegetation, grassland, water and bare soil) do not show such difference between July and August. The results of four classifications clearly show that the use of multi-temporal images is essential to accurately classify the crop lands. The layered classification method, in which each class is separated by a subset of TM images, shows the highest classification accuracy (93.7%) of the crop lands. The classification accuracies are lower when we use only a single TM image of either July or August. Because of the different planting practice of potato and the growth condition of wheat, the spectral characteristics of potato and wheat cannot be fully separated from other cover types with TM image of either July or August. Further refinements on the spatial characteristics of existing crop lands may enhance the crop mapping method in Mongolia.

ID SALT-AFFECTED SOILS
AB Waterlogging and salinization are the twin evils of the irrigated agriculture in arid and semi-arid areas, which reduce the productivity of agricultural lands adversely. Managing salinity so as to minimize its environmental impact is a prerequisite for the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture. It necessitates establishing fast monitoring systems that facilitate taking actions. Remote sensing appears to offer several advantages over the conventional ground methods used to map and monitor soil salinity. This paper describes an integrated approach to assess soil salinity using remotely sensed data. This encompasses spatial analysis of ground truth and satellite data. The study area is located in the District of Faisalabad in Pakistan. The ground truth data of soil salinity from selected sampling points is tied to the corresponding pixels from the satellite image bands. Remotely sensed data based salinity indices (band combinations) and principal components using principal component analysis (PCA) are developed to find out the occurrence pattern of the salinization. Out of the six salinity indices developed, the following proved to be the most promising when compared with ground truth data.
   Salinity Index = (B-2 x B-3)/B-1
   Where; B-1, B-2 and B-3 are bands of the satellite, IRS-1B LISS-II, in spectral range of band 1 (0.45-0.52 mu m), band 2 (0.52-0.59 mu m) and band 3 (0.62-0.68 mu m) respectively. Regression methods were applied to find the best correlation between salinity data and corresponding pixels on the satellite images. The resulting images were categorized into three distinct classes of saline soils; slightly saline, moderately saline and strongly saline. Using supervised maximum likelihood classification, the images were classified with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. Based on the classified results, saline soils covered 8.7%, 14.2% and 6.6% of the image area in 1991, 1994 and 1997 respectively. The relationship between salt affected soils, waterlogged soils and groundwater quality revealed that 60 to 70% of the salt-affected soils occurred in the zone of shallow water table within 200 cm from ground surface, which is indicative of waterlogged situation. The groundwater in the saline areas is also of hazardous quality, which restricts plant growth except high salt-tolerant crops.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Figure A shows the probability density of salt-affected soils with intensity ranging from zero to unity. "Zero" indicated normal soils and above zero to unity represented intensity of salt-affected soils.
   Using satellite data, the principal component analysis (PCA) and the salinity indices are found to be promising techniques for assessment of saline soils. In the scenario of water scarcity (restricted irrigation supplies in supply channels) due to persistent drought, the reuse of poor quality ground water for irrigation and the failure of tile drainage system in the area are likely to disturb the water ecosystem resulting in increased risks of further environmental land degradation.

AB Overwhelming emphasis of this study was to develop comprehensive sets of simplified methods and protocols for water productivity mapping (WPM) using high spatial resolution satellite images (ASTER), based on combination of crop classification, yield, and water use (actual evapotranspiration) computation for crops using thermal band data and surface energy balance models. The study used satellite images for the year 2012 and focused on Water Productivity Mapping (WPM) of wheat, alfalfa, corn and Rhodes grass fields under centre pivot sprinkler irrigated system at Todhia Arable Farm of the Al-Kharj region, in Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Crop water productivity map (WPM) was generated for the whole farm by dividing the crop productivity map (CPM) with water use map (WUM). The water used by different crops varied considerably depending on the crop growing season in seasonal crops (wheat and corn) and the harvesting/cutting schedules in alfalfa and Rhodes grass, which are multi-cut crops. The highest water productivity (t/ha mm) was observed in corn (1.24), followed by Rhodes grass (0.55) wheat (0.4) and alfalfa (0.38).

AB Heavy metal stress, which is a serious environmental problem, affects both animal and human health through the food chain. However, such subtle stress information is difficult to detect in remote sensing images. Therefore, enhancing the stress signal is key to accurately identifying heavy metal contamination in crops. The aim of this study was to identify heavy metal stress in rice at a regional scale by mining the time-series characteristics of rice growth under heavy metal stress using the gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm. The experimental area was located in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. We collected situ-measured data and Sentinel-2A images corresponding to the 2019-2021 period. First, the spatial distribution of the rice in the study area was extracted using the random forest algorithm based on the Sentinel 2 images. Second, the time-series characteristics were analyzed, sensitive parameters were selected, and a GRU classification model was constructed. Third, the model was used to identify the heavy metals in rice and then assess the accuracy of the classification results using performance metrics such as the accuracy rate, precision, recall rate (recall), and F1-score (F1-score). The results showed that the GRU model based on the time series of the red-edge location feature index has a good classification performance with an overall accuracy of 93.5% and a Kappa coefficient of 85.6%. This study shows that regional heavy metal stress in crops can be accurately detected using the GRU algorithm. A combination of spectrum and temporal information appears to be a promising method for monitoring crops under various types of stress.

AB More than 80 % of the total water consumption in Mediterranean countries is used for agricultural practices. When this water comes from subterranean reservoirs (aquifers), the evaluation of extracted volumes is very complex using the traditional methods. The exploitation of subterranean waters in Spain has become, in some cases, an environmental problem since it has affected highly valuable wetlands and river flows by depressing the water table levels. In this work, we introduce a methodology based on Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques that allows to evaluate the extracted water volumes for irrigation, with high accuracy levels and relatively low economic costs.
   The developed system is based on the elaboration of crop maps that are obtained from the analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images. The used procedure is a supervised classification of images that combines maximum likelihood algorithms and decision-tree criterions. The resulting data are integrated in a GIS and crossed with the values of water volumes needed per crop. The obtained output allows quantifying not only the spatial distribution of the water consumption, but also its evolution through time.

AB Advances in computer-based technologies promise to help biological and agricultural researchers find alternative solutions to complex problems. Two such technologies are neural networks and fuzzy logic. The generalization capability of neural networks, along with their adaptive, self-organizing, and fault-tolerant characteristics, allow them to learn and make reasonable decisions from incomplete or noisy data. Fuzzy logic is an adaptive and dynamic system that can work from approximate data to find an optimum solution. Both fuzzy logic and neural networks have potential applications in biology and agriculture ranging from process control, crop production and management, climate classification, remote sensing, and disease diagnosis. The fundamental and complementary characteristics of these two technologies have led researchers to combine them in "neuro-fuzzy" or "fuzzy-neuro" systems, which are suitable for complex and ill-defined applications.

AB Detecting the seasonal agricultural crop pattern accurately is a vital part of the agricultural planning. In this extent, Cukurova Region that is located in Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey was evaluated on agricultural landscape pattern. This region is the most productive agricultural region of Turkey also crop variability and yield are higher than many parts of the world. The main agricultural part of the area is called Lower Seyhan Plane (LSP) and it has been formed by the Seyhan, Ceyhan and Berdan rivers. The purpose of the study was to define the wheat, corn and cotton crop pattern using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images and object based classification approach for 2007 and 2013 cropping years. Three main crop's areal difference were evaluated and changes were monitored between 2007 and 2013. The accuracy of the classifications were obtained by the spatial kappa statistics. Overall kappa accuracy was derived to be 0.9. Classification results were shown that wheat areas were decreased 35% and corn and cotton areas were increased 49% and 69% respectively. Particularly, government subventions and market demands were impacted cropping pattern in the region significantly. In addition, multi-temporal Landsat images and object based classification were a great combination to define regional agricultural crop pattern with very good accuracy (> 90%).

The supervised classification approach with fuzzy convolution technique and Maximum likelihood classifier has been used for analysis of satellite image for the month of February 2015 and ground truth data collected during field visit for testing and training purpose. Fuzzy convolution has been applied on the fuzzy layers obtained after fuzzy classification and compared these result with Maximum Likelihood classifier. It is found that Maximum likelihood has given better result for overall classification but for crop area class; fuzzy convolution gives more truthful results.

AB Accurately mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is an important prerequisite for agricultural field management (e.g., weed control), plant phenotyping and yield prediction, as well as ecological characterization. Compared to traditional mapping practices that require intensive field surveys, remote sensing technologies offer efficient and cost-effective means for crop type mapping from regional to global scales. However, mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is a challenge because of diverse and complex spectral profiles of crops. We propose a novel deep learning method, namely deep progressively expanded network (dPEN), for mapping nineteen different objects including crop types, weeds and crop residues, in a heterogeneous agricultural field using WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery. To assess the mapping accuracy of dPEN, we created a calibrated WV-3 dataset with the corresponding ground truth. In addition, the suitability of visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1195 nm-2365 nm) bands of WV-3 to classification accuracy were examined and discussed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore the significance of all SWIR bands in WV-3 for classification accuracy in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape. The results demonstrated that: (1) The proposed dPEN allows for building a deeper neural network from multi spectral data which was the limitation of many convolutional neural networks; (2) dPEN was able to extract more discriminative features from VNIR and SWIR bands by producing the highest overall accuracy (OA: 86.06%) over competing methods such as support vector machine and random forest; (3) The inclusion of WV-3 SWIR bands greatly improved the classification accuracy; (4) SWIR bands were particularly beneficial to improve the classification accuracy of some individual classes such as weeds, crop residues, and corn and soybean during late developmental stages; (5) The red-edge band (705-745 nm) was identified as the most important band affecting the classification accuracy nearly 10%, whereas the coastal band (400-450 nm) provided the lowest contribution; and (6) SWIR-5 band (2145-2185 nm) contributed most to OA by enhancing it approximately 4% when combined with VNIR bands, while SWIR-1 (1195-1225 nm) yielded the lowest improvement (1.55%) for OA. These research outcomes provide useful information for efficiently mapping agricultural landscape, and indicate the potential practices of dPEN and contributions of spectral bands in WV-3 for plant phenotyping, weed control, and crop residue retention.

AB Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) have been used as a major source of data, particularly with respect to the creation of thematic maps. This process is usually modeled as a supervised classification problem where the system needs to learn the patterns of interest provided by the user and assign a class to the rest of the image regions. Associated with the nature of RSIs, there are several challenges that can be highlighted: (1) they are georeferenced images, i.e., a geographic coordinate is associated with each pixel; (2) the data commonly captures specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum instead of the visible spectrum, which requires the development of specific algorithms to describe patterns; (3) the detail level of each data may vary, resulting in images with different spatial and pixel resolution, but covering the same area; (4) due to the high pixel resolution images, efficient processing algorithms are desirable. Thus, it is very common to have images obtained from different sensors, which could improve the quality of thematic maps generated. However, this requires the creation of techniques to properly encode and combine the different properties of the images. Therefore, this paper proposes a boosting-based technique for classification of regions in RSIs that manages to encode features extracted from different sources of data, spectral and spatial domains. The new approach is evaluated in an urban classification scenario and a coffee crop recognition task, achieving statistically better results in comparison with the proposed baselines in urban classification and better results at some baselines for the coffee crop recognition.

AB Crop type mapping at the field level is critical for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring, and satellite imagery is becoming an increasingly abundant and useful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. When training data is not available in one region, classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were 6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve a Random Forest classifier.

ID SEGMENTATION; EFFICIENCY
AB Ground cover classification is one of the core applications in remote sensing. Classification of imaging radar data using conventional single-channel or dual-channel usually results in poor accuracy due to limited number of observations. For this reason, applications of full polarimetric data are growing. In this article, Radarsat-2 quad-pol data of an agriculture scene acquired on August, 2013 over the Nile Delta, Egypt, has been used to evaluate the accuracy of three supervised classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and decision tree (DT), in discriminating between four different crops: rice, maize, grape and cotton, in addition to urban land cover. A set of principal components was used in the SVM classifier. Our goal is to build a generic model that minimizes the error of future classification using the same training data. Results indicate that combining the most commonly used polarimetric parameters from Pauli, Cloude-Pottier, and Freeman-Durden decompositions along with the three fundamental backscatter coefficients (sigma(0)(hh), sigma(0)(vv), and sigma(0)(hv)) using SVM classifier strike an appropriate balance that minimizes the effect of the training error on the classification accuracy without going to over-fitting classification. This leads to the highest overall classification accuracy of 94.48%. The overall classification accuracy using different combinations of parameters and different classifiers is given.

AB In this article, we demonstrate an object-oriented method for detailed urban vegetation delineation by using 1 m resolution, four-band digital aerial photography as the only input data. A hierarchical classification scheme was developed to discriminate vegetation types at both coarse and fine scales. The processes of vegetation extraction include the examination of spectral and spatial relationships, object geometry, and the hierarchical relationship of image objects. The advantages of four different segmentation methods were combined to identify feature similarities, both among image objects and with their neighbours. Image growth took place if those neighbours satisfied a series of criteria given a set of features of class-defined objects. Object-based classification results demonstrated higher accuracy than those using pixel-based classification methods. The object-oriented method achieved overall classification accuracies of 87.5%, 90.5%, and 90.5% at three different levels of class hierarchy, and very high producer's accuracies were demonstrated in the classes of tree, crop, and different types of grass. The object-oriented classification method described here proved effective for separating vegetation types defined by life form, area, or shape without using additional remote-sensing data sources with different resolutions or any ancillary data such as digital elevation models.

TI CROP AREA ESTIMATES BASED ON PER-PIXEL SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION ON EO-1
   ALI IMAGE FOR A TEST SITE IN NORTHEAST BULGARIA
SO AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to investigate the crop area estimates based on perpixel classification for Zhiten test site situated in Northeast Bulgaria. The chosen satellite image is acquired from multispectral EO-1 ALI sensor on 09.07.2011. The methodology of this article includes the following working stages: 1) applying arable mask from CORINE 2006 land-cover database; 2) conducting per-pixel supervised classification using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) algorithm for crop identification; 3) applying accuracy assessment tool in ERDAS Imagine and deriving accuracy totals and kappa statistics; 4) calculating crop area estimated based on pixel-counting technique. The overall classification accuracy for the EO-1 ALI image is 96.24% and overall kappa statistics is 0.9397. The high overall accuracy can be accomplished after carefully chosing representative training samples. The beginning of July can be a perfect time to separate spring crops (sunflower and maize cultivars) and assess crop area estimated for all cultivated crops based on per-pixel classification with overall accuracy above 95%. The down side of this study is that at the time of image acquisition the winter crops are difficult to separate, since they are already with very low reflectance values.

AB A crop map of The Netherlands was created using a methodology that integrates multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite imagery, statistical data on crop area and parcel boundaries from a 1:10 000 digital topographic map. In the first phase a crop field database was created by extracting static parcel boundaries from the digital topographic map and by adding dynamic crop boundaries using on-screen digitizing. In the next phase the crop type was determined from the spectral and phenological properties of each field. The resulting crop map has an accuracy larger than 80% for most individual crops and an overall accuracy of 90%. By comparing cost and man-hours it was demonstrated that per-field classification is more efficient than per-pixel classification and decreased the effort for classification from 1500 to 500 man-hours, but the effort for creating the crop field database was estimated at 2300 man-hours. The use of image segmentation techniques for deriving the crop field database was discussed. It was concluded that image segmentation cannot replace the use of a large-scale topographic map but, in the future, image segmentation may be used to map the dynamic crop boundaries within the topographic parcels.

AB This paper investigates the application of remote sensing and geographical information systems for detecting land-use/land cover (LULC) changes and assessing its affect by climate change in the southern region of Port Said Governorate, Egypt. Three Landsat images (Landsat TM-5, ETM+7, and Landsat-8) have been utilized to quantify the changes from 1986 to 2016. The Landsat images are useful for this study because of its high spatial and spectral resolution. Calibration techniques, geometric, and atmospheric corrections were utilized to pre-processed the images. Hybrid unsupervised and supervised classification was used as a post-classification technique. Each method used was assessed and checked in the field. Six main and ten subclasses LULC units are recognized and mapping produced for different classes. Landsat images have shown 6 categories of land-use as following: bare land areas, crop vegetation areas, natural vegetation areas, fishpond areas, salt land areas and waterbody areas. The result showed the change that has occurred during 30 years of period. Positive changes areas are displayed in supervised classes of LULC in bare land areas of +51.3 km(2); crop vegetation areas about +17.65 km(2) and water bodies areas of +9.53 km(2). While negative changes areas, are displayed in classes of LULC in natural vegetation areas about -37.16 km(2); fish pond areas around -39.36 km(2) and salts land areas around -0.58 km(2). Unsupervised classification classes have the same way the expression of the increase and decrease and change a rate of changes in supervised classification classes of LULC.

AB Land use/cover is an important watershed surface characteristic that affects surface runoff and erosion. Many of the available hydrological models divide the watershed into Hydrological Response Units (HRU), which are spatial units with expected similar hydrological behaviours. The division into HRU's requires good-quality spatial data on land use/cover. This paper presents different approaches to attain an optimal land use/cover map based on remote sensing imagery for a Himalayan watershed in northern India. First digital classifications using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and a decision tree classifier were applied. The results obtained from the decision tree were better and even improved after post classification sorting. But the obtained land use/cover map was not sufficient for the delineation of HRUs, since the agricultural land use/cover class did not discriminate between the two major crops in the area i.e. paddy and maize. Therefore we adopted a visual classification approach using optical data alone and also fused with ENVISAT ASAR data. This second step with detailed classification system resulted into better classification accuracy within the 'agricultural land' class which will be further combined with topography and soil type to derive HRU's for physically-based hydrological modelling.
