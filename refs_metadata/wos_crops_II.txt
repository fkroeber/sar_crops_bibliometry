AB Land use/cover is an important watershed surface characteristic that affects surface runoff and erosion. Many of the available hydrological models divide the watershed into Hydrological Response Units (HRU), which are spatial units with expected similar hydrological behaviours. The division into HRU's requires good-quality spatial data on land use/cover. This paper presents different approaches to attain an optimal land use/cover map based on remote sensing imagery for a Himalayan watershed in northern India. First digital classifications using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and a decision tree classifier were applied. The results obtained from the decision tree were better and even improved after post classification sorting. But the obtained land use/cover map was not sufficient for the delineation of HRUs, since the agricultural land use/cover class did not discriminate between the two major crops in the area i.e. paddy and maize. Therefore we adopted a visual classification approach using optical data alone and also fused with ENVISAT ASAR data. This second step with detailed classification system resulted into better classification accuracy within the 'agricultural land' class which will be further combined with topography and soil type to derive HRU's for physically-based hydrological modelling.

AB In Spain, water for agricultural use represents about 85% of the total water demand, and irrigated crop production constitutes a major contribution to the country's economy. Field studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of multispectral reflectance and seven vegetation indices in the visible and near-infrared spectral range for discriminating and classifying bare soil and several horticultural irrigated crops at different dates. This is the first step of a broader project with the overall goal of using satellite imagery with high spatial and multispectral resolutions for mapping irrigated crops to improve agricultural water use. On-ground reflectance data of bare soil and annual herbaceous crops [garlic (Allium, saffron:), onion (Allium cepa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), bean (Vicia faba), maize (Zoo mays), potato (Solanum tuberosum), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), melon (Cucumis melo), watermelon (Citrillus lanatus), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)I, perennial herbaceous crops [alfalfa (Medicago swim) and asparagus (Asparagus officinalis)1, deciduous trees [plum (Prunus spp.)1, and non-deciduous trees [citrus (Citrus spp.) and olive (Olea europaea)I were collected using a handheld field spectroradiometer in spring, early summer, and late summer. Three classification methods were applied to discriminate differences in reflectance between the different crops and bare soil: stepwise discriminant analysis, and two artificial neural networks: multilayer perception (M LP) and radial basis function. On any of the sampling dates, the highest degree of accuracy was achieved with the M LP neural network, showing 89.8%, 91.1%, and 96.4% correct classification in spring, early summer, and late summer, respectively. The classification matrix from the MLP model using cross-validation showed that most crops discriminated in spring and late summer were 100% classifiable. For future works, we would recommend acquiring two multispectral satellite images taken in spring and late summer for monitoring and mapping these irrigated crops, thus avoiding costly field surveys.

AB A new set of temporal features derived from codispersion and cross-semivariogram geostatistical functions is proposed, described, extracted, and evaluated for object-based land-use/land-cover change detection using high resolution images. Five features were extracted from the codispersion function and another six from the cross-semivariogram. The set of features describes the temporal behaviour of the internal structure of the image objects defined in a cadastral database. The set of extracted features was combined with spectral information and a feature selection study was performed using forward stepwise discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, as well as correlation and feature interpretation analysis. The temporal feature set was validated using high resolution aerial images from an agricultural area located in south-east Spain, in order to solve a tree crop change detection problem. Direct classification using decision tree classifier was used as change detection method. Different classifications were performed comparing various feature group combinations in order to obtain the most suitable features for this study. Results showed that the new sets of cross-semivariogram and codispersion features provided high global accuracy classification results (83.55% and 85.71% respectively), showing high potential for detecting changes related to the internal structure of agricultural tree crop parcels. A significant increase in accuracy value was obtained when combining features from both groups with spectral information (94.59%).

ID AGRICULTURE; INSURANCE
AB Identifying crop loss at field parcel scale using satellite images is challenging: first, crop loss is caused by many factors during the growing season; second, reliable reference data about crop loss are lacking; third, there are many ways to define crop loss. This study investigates the feasibility of using satellite images to train machine learning (ML) models to classify agricultural field parcels into those with and without crop loss. The reference data for this study was provided by Finnish Food Authority (FFA) containing crop loss information of approximately 1.4 million field parcels in Finland covering about 3.5 million ha from 2000 to 2015. This reference data was combined with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 7 images, in which more than 80% of the possible data are missing. Despite the hard problem with extremely noisy data, among the four ML models we tested, random forest (with mean imputation and missing value indicators) achieved the average AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.688 +/- 0.059 over all 16 years with the range [0.602, 0.795] in identifying new crop-loss fields based on reference fields of the same year. To our knowledge, this is one of the first large scale benchmark study of using machine learning for crop loss classification at field parcel scale. The classification setting and trained models have numerous potential applications, for example, allowing government agencies or insurance companies to verify crop-loss claims by farmers and realise efficient agricultural monitoring.

AB Soil coverage and its modifications are critical variables in human-environmental sciences. Changes in land use are causes and consequences of climate change. This situation makes that detailed and updated information is needed for many applications. Remote sensing provides data of large areas periodically, so it becomes a useful input to soil classification. The objectives of this work were to determinate algorithm and images combination that produces the best results to classify agricultural land and, simultaneously, evaluate the need of making atmospheric corrections over them, when classifying multi-temporal/multi-sensor series. The two supervised classification algorithms used were neural networks and maximum likelihood. In the study area, agriculture is the main land use, predominantly summer crops, and the area sown with soybean, corn and sorghum account for over 90% of the total. Time series of Landsat 8 and SPOT 5 images were used, and 164 plots were registered to train and validate the models as ground truth. Maximum likelihood and neural networks models produce very good results when multi-temporal/multi-sensor series are used, with global accuracy between 79.17% to 90.14% and Kappa index between 60% to 82%. The radiometric correction at surface level did not improve the results when the reflectance was corrected at the top of the atmosphere. The time series that use images taken in more advanced phenological stages of crops produce better coverage classifications than time series that use images from early stages.

AB The potential of hyperspectral aerial imagery for the detection of weed infestation and nitrogen fertilization level in a corn (Zea mays L.) crop was evaluated. A Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) was used to acquire hyperspectral data over a field experiment laid out at the Lods Agronomy Research Centre of Macdonald Campus, McGill University, Quebec, Canada. Corn was grown under four weed management strategies (no weed control, control of grasses, control of broadleaf weeds, and full weed control) factorally combined with nitrogen fertilization rates of 60, 120, and 250 N kg/ha. The aerial image was acquired at the tasseling stage, which was 66 days after planting. For the classification of remote sensing imagery, various widely used supervised classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, parallelepiped, and binary coding) and more sophisticated classification approaches (spectral angle mapper and linear spectral unmixing) were investigated. It was difficult to distinguish the combined effect of both weed and nitrogen treatments simultaneously. However, higher classification accuracies were obtained when only one factor, either weed or nitrogen treatment, was considered. With different classifiers, depending on the factors considered for the classification, accuracies ranged from 65.84% to 99.46%. No single classifier was found useful for all the conditions.

AB Rice is one of the most produced crops in the world consumed by over half of the entire population according to the FAOSTAT (2008). In addition to the agricultural value of rice, paddy-farming method used to grow rice raises a number of environmental issues, such as methane emissions and high fresh water consumption, associated with the production of rice. Monitoring of paddy fields at large scale is thus important to investigate their impacts on available water resources and greenhouse gas emissions as well as to predict and plan rice production of the year.
   Due to the unique spectral features of paddy rice fields during the transplanting season (i.e., strong signals in the short-wave infrared range caused by the flooded soil of the paddy fields) the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) has been used in conjunction with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map paddy rice fields using satellite imagery (e. g., Xiao et al. (2005); Xiao et al. (2006)). To date, satellite images of spatial scales ranging from 30 m (e. g., Landsat) to 500 m (e. g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) or coarser scales were directly compared with ground survey data to classify the land use in the mixed paddy rice and other cropping fields. However, due to the small size of typical rice fields in Asia where majority of rice fields are located, only a fraction of each satellite pixel is covered by the rice field. Moreover, the strong short-wave infrared signal from flooded soil may drop significantly as growing rice canopy masks signals from the background soil. In order to develop more sophisticated spectral models for satellite-based land use classification, these complex features of the paddy fields need to be analysed using measurements made directly on the rice fields in various growing stages.
   We present spectral measurements collected during the Australia-India Land Surface Parameterisation Experiment for Remote Sensing (AILSPEX-RS1) conducted in February 2011 in the Musi catchment, India. Spectral signals at six wavelengths (i.e., 530, 570, 650, 855, 1240 and 1640 nm) were measured over 16 different land cover types during the local transplanting season of rice. Conditions of rice paddy fields varied from no-rice flooded soil to moderately grown rice canopies as tall as approximately 50 cm. LSWI of paddy rice linearly decreased with NDVI while the index in the non-paddy-rice fields increased linearly with NDVI. The linearly decreasing trend of LSWI of paddy rice continued until the NDVI values reached similar to 0.8, after which LSWI of paddy rice increased with NDVI following the trend of the other crops. The analysis of the explicit NDVI-LSWI trends can be applied to map paddy rice fields until rice grows to similar to 35 cm while the simple comparison of the indices by their magnitude can be applied to the paddy rice of approximately 20 cm.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that can provide thematic information at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than satellite images have great potential in crop classification. Due to the ultra-high spatial resolution of UAV images, spatial contextual information such as texture is often used for crop classification. From a data availability viewpoint, it is not always possible to acquire time-series UAV images due to limited accessibility to the study area. Thus, it is necessary to improve classification performance for situations when a single or minimum number of UAV images are available for crop classification. In this study, we investigate the potential of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture information for crop classification with time-series UAV images and machine learning classifiers including random forest and support vector machine. In particular, the impact of combining texture and spectral information on the classification performance is evaluated for cases that use only one UAV image or multi-temporal images as input. A case study of crop classification in Anbandegi of Korea was conducted for the above comparisons. The best classification accuracy was achieved when multi-temporal UAV images which can fully account for the growth cycles of crops were combined with GLCM-based texture features. However, the impact of the utilization of texture information was not significant. In contrast, when one August UAV image was used for crop classification, the utilization of texture information significantly affected the classification performance. Classification using texture features extracted from GLCM with larger kernel size significantly improved classification accuracy, an improvement of 7.72%p in overall accuracy for the support vector machine classifier, compared with classification based solely on spectral information. These results indicate the usefulness of texture information for classification of ultra-high-spatial-resolution UAV images, particularly when acquisition of time-series UAV images is difficult and only one UAV image is used for crop classification.

AB The Sentinel-2 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program provides multispectral remote sensing data at decametric spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 time-series data to enable classification of an inherent biophysical property, in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. The tested inherent biophysical property was the soil texture. Soil texture classification was performed on each individual Sentinel-2 image with a linear support vector machine. Two sources of uncertainty were studied: uncertainties due to the Sentinel-2 acquisition date and uncertainties due to the soil sample selection in the training dataset. The first uncertainty analysis was achieved by analyzing the diversity of classification results obtained from the time series of soil texture classifications, considering that the temporal resolution is akin to a repetition of spectral measurements. The second uncertainty analysis was achieved from each individual Sentinel-2 image, based on a bootstrapping procedure corresponding to 100 independent classifications obtained with different training data. The Simpson index was used to compute this diversity in the classification results. This work was carried out in an Indian cultivated region (84 km(2), part of Berambadi catchment, in the Karnataka state). It used a time-series of six Sentinel-2 images acquired from February to April 2017 and 130 soil surface samples, collected over the study area and characterized in terms of texture. The classification analysis showed the following: (i) each single-date image analysis resulted in moderate performances for soil texture classification, and (ii) high confusion was obtained between neighboring textural classes, and low confusion was obtained between remote textural classes. The uncertainty analysis showed that (i) the classification of remote textural classes (clay and sandy loam) was more certain than classifications of intermediate classes (sandy clay and sandy clay loam), (ii) a final soil textural map can be produced depending on the allowed uncertainty, and iii) a higher level of allowed uncertainty leads to increased bare soil coverage. These results illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2 for providing input for modeling environmental processes and crop management.

AB Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data has been widely used in the fields of crop and rice classification. The cloudy and rainy weather characteristics of the monsoon season greatly reduce the likelihood of obtaining high-quality optical remote sensing images. In addition, the diverse crop-planting system in Vietnam also hinders the comparison of NDVI among different crop stages. To address these problems, we apply a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance-based similarity measure approach and use the entire yearly NDVI time series to reduce the inaccuracy of classification using a single image. We first de-noise the NDVI time series using S-G filtering based on the TIMESAT software. Then, a standard NDVI time-series base for rice growth is established based on field survey data and Google Earth sample data. NDVI time-series data for each pixel are constructed and the DTW distance with the standard rice growth NDVI time series is calculated. Then, we apply thresholds to extract rice growth areas. A qualitative assessment using statistical data and a spatial assessment using sampled data from the rice-cropping map reveal a high mapping accuracy at the national scale between the statistical data, with the corresponding R-2 being as high as 0.809; however, the mapped rice accuracy decreased at the provincial scale due to the reduced number of rice planting areas per province. An analysis of the results indicates that the 500-m resolution MODIS data are limited in terms of mapping scattered rice parcels. The results demonstrate that the DTW-based similarity measure of the NDVI time series can be effectively used to map large-area rice cropping systems with diverse cultivation processes.

AB The generally limited availability of training data relative to the usually high data dimension pose a great challenge to accurate classification of hyperspectral imagery, especially for identifying crops character-ized with highly correlated spectra. However, traditional parametric classification models are problematic due to the need of non-singular class-specific covariance matrices. In this research, a novel sparse graph regularization (SGR) method is presented, aiming at robust crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery with very few in situ data. The core of SGR lies in propagating labels from known data to unknown, which is triggered by: (1) the fraction matrix generated for the large unknown data by using an effective sparse representation algorithm with respect to the few training data serving as the dictionary; (2) the prediction function estimated for the few training data by formulating a regularization model based on sparse graph. Then, the labels of large unknown data can be obtained by maximizing the posterior probability distribution based on the two ingredients. SGR is more discriminative, data-adaptive, robust to noise, and efficient, which is unique with regard to previously proposed approaches and has high- potentials in discriminating crops, especially when facing insufficient training data and high dimensional spectral space. The study area is located at Zhangye basin in the middle reaches of Heihe watershed, Gansu, China, where eight crop types were mapped with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and Shortwave Infrared Airborne Spectrogrpahic Imager (SASI) hyperspectral data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other traditional and state-of-the-art methods.

AB Crop type mapping at the field level is necessary for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring and food security. As remote sensing imagery continues to increase in spatial and temporal resolution, it is becoming an increasingly powerful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, automated crop type mapping remains constrained by a lack of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models, in this study, we explore the use of random forests transferred across geographic distance and time and unsupervised methods in conjunction with aggregate crop statistics for crop type mapping in the US Midwest, where we simulated the label-poor setting by depriving the models of labels in various states and years. We validated our methodology using available 30 m spatial resolution crop type labels from the US Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using Google Earth Engine, we computed Fourier transforms (or harmonic regressions) on the time series of Landsat Surface Reflectance and derived vegetation indices, and extracted the coefficients as features for machine learning models. We found that random forests trained on regions and years similar in growing degree days (ODD) transfer to the target region with accuracies consistently exceeding 80%. Accuracies decrease as differences in GDD expand. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with class labels derived using county-level crop statistics classify crops less consistently but require no field-level labels for training. GMM achieves over 85% accuracy in states with low crop diversity (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska), but performs sometimes no better than random when high crop diversity interferes with clustering (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan). Under the appropriate conditions, these methods offer options for field-resolution crop type mapping in regions around the world with few or no ground labels.

AB Classification of species at the individual tree level would be beneficial to many applications including forest landscape visualization, forest management, and biodiversity monitoring. This article develops a patch-based classification algorithm of individual tree species based on convolutional neural network. The individual trees are first detected using the local maximum method from the canopy height model, as derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The detected individual trees are then cropped into patches for classification based on the tree apexes, and three spatial scale image patches are chosen for analysis and discussion. A modified ResNet50 deep network is further employed for the cropped individual tree patches classification. The patch-based method accounts for the contexture information of a tree and does not require the feature selection or the feature reduction processes. About 1388 training samples including Ficus microcarpa Linn. f., Delonix regia, Chorisia speciosa A.St.-Hil., Dimocarpus longan Lour., Musa nana Lour., Carica papaya, and Others (the other tree species except the above six) were collected from both field work and visual interpretation. Aerial images, LiDAR data, and Worldview images were used for the tree species classification. For 362 test tree samples, the results of patch size 64 achieve the best accuracies, and the proposed method outperforms the traditional machine learning method with the overall accuracy of 89.06 0.58 using aerial images only. Transferability Study to the Luhu Park also indicated the feasibility of our method. While challenges in individual tree detection and multisource data fusion remain, the solution shows the potential in characterizing tree species at the individual tree level using remote sensing data.

AB The monitoring of crops is of vital importance for food and environmental security in a global and European context. The main goal of this study was to assess the crop mapping performance provided by the 100 m spatial resolution of PROBA-V compared to coarser resolution data (e.g., PROBA-V at 300 m) for a 2250 km(2) test site in Bulgaria. The focus was on winter and summer crop mapping with three to five classes. For classification, single- and multi-date spectral data were used as well as NDVI time series. Our results demonstrate that crop identification using 100 m PROBA-V data performed significantly better in all experiments compared to the PROBA-V 300 m data. PROBA-V multispectral imagery, acquired in spring (March) was the most appropriate for winter crop identification, while satellite data acquired in summer (July) was superior for summer crop identification. The classification accuracy from PROBA-V 100 m compared to PROBA-V 300 m was improved by 5.8% to 14.8% depending on crop type. Stacked multi-date satellite images with three to four images gave overall classification accuracies of 74%-77% (PROBA-V 100 m data) and 66%-70% (PROBA-V 300 m data) with four classes (wheat, rapeseed, maize, and sunflower). This demonstrates that three to four image acquisitions, well distributed over the growing season, capture most of the spectral and temporal variability in our test site. Regarding the PROBA-V NDVI time series, useful results were only obtained if crops were grouped into two broader crop type classes (summer and winter crops). Mapping accuracies decreased significantly when mapping more classes. Again, a positive impact of the increased spatial resolution was noted. Together, the findings demonstrate the positive effect of the 100 m resolution PROBA-V data compared to the 300 m for crop mapping. This has important implications for future data provision and strengthens the arguments for a second generation of this mission originally designed solely as a gap-filler mission.

AB Spatial features retrieved from satellite data play an important role for improving crop classification. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method to extract and organize spatial features to improve parcel-based crop classification using high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Central to this method is the use of multiple deep convolutional networks (DCNs) to extract spatial features and to use the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to organize spatial features. First, a precise farmland parcel map was delineated from optical images. Second, hundreds of spatial features were retrieved using multiple DCNs from preprocessed SAR images and overlaid onto the parcel map to construct multivariate time-series of crop growth for parcels. Third, LSTM-based network structures for organizing these time-series features were constructed to produce a final parcel-based classification map. The method was applied to a dataset of high-resolution ZY-3 optical images and multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data to classify crop types in the Hunan Province of China. The classification results, showing an improvement of greater than 5.0% in overall accuracy relative to methods without spatial features, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting and organizing spatial features for improving parcel-based crop classification.

AB The exploitation of the high revisit time (8-16 days) by the COSMO-SkyMed (R) (CSK (R)) satellites is an important opportunity for agricultural mapping. This study aims at evaluating CSK (R) potentiality to classify different crop types, with CSK (R) multi-temporal images collected over the agricultural site of Marchfeld, in Austria. Two different time series of CSK (R) HIMAGE SAR scenes, at 3m resolution, 9 at HH and 9 at VH polarization were taken during the vegetation season (from April to October 2014). CSK (R) data were processed and analyzed to investigate crop signatures from CSK (R) backscattering coefficient of five crop types, namely carrot, corn, potato, soybean and sugarbeet. In situ field observations were conducted during the SAR data acquisition. CKS (R) data were overlaid with crop fields ground truth. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method has been applied. The classification results yield very promising overall classification accuracies using the combination of HH and VH polarization.

AB Seasonal climate prediction offers the potential to anticipate variations in crop production early enough to adjust critical decisions. Until recently, interest in exploiting seasonal forecasts from dynamic climate models (e.g. general circulation models, GCMs) for applications that involve crop simulation models has been hampered by the difference in spatial and temporal scale of GCMs and crop models, and by the dynamic, nonlinear relationship between meteorological variables and crop response. Although GCMs simulate the atmosphere on a sub-daily time step, their coarse spatial resolution and resulting distortion of day-to-day variability limits the use of their daily output. Crop models have used daily GCM output with some success by either calibrating simulated yields or correcting the daily rainfall output of the GCM to approximate the statistical properties of historic observations. Stochastic weather generators are used to disaggregate seasonal forecasts either by adjusting input parameters in a manner that captures the predictable components of climate, or by constraining synthetic weather sequences to match predicted values. Predicting crop yields, simulated with historic weather data, as a statistical function of seasonal climatic predictors, eliminates the need for daily weather data conditioned on the forecast, but must often address poor statistical properties of the crop-climate relationship. Most of the work on using crop simulation with seasonal climate forecasts has employed historic analogs based on categorical ENSO indices. Other methods based on classification of predictors or weather types can provide daily weather inputs to crop models conditioned on forecasts. Advances in climate-based crop forecasting in the coming decade are likely to include more robust evaluation of the methods reviewed here, dynamically embedding crop models within climate models to account for crop influence on regional climate, enhanced use of remote sensing, and research in the emerging area of 'weather within climate'.

AB Precision farming is a relatively new part of agriculture. It is very important to understand the processes of plants. Especially understanding the various stages of plants growth, including their internal processes, allows us to evaluate the health of crops or estimate yields. There are a large number of tools and approaches to carry out these analyzes. Among the well-researched methods may include biophysical techniques. Laboratory analyzes are frequently used and very accurate. Unfortunately, these methods use only spot samples. It is very difficult to apply the result to the entire agricultural area. Use of remote sensing (RS) data and sensor networks in the agricultural area is very wide. Each crop reflects different amounts of energy in different parts of the electromagnetic radiation. This fact is not only used for the classification of crops, but especially for estimating yields, health assessment, evaluation of water stress plants or determining the amount of chemicals in the area of interest. The big advantage is that we can obtain data not only point samples, but we have all important data from the whole area of interest. This article describes the influence of biotic and abiotic factors of agricultural crops on the spectral reflectance curves. Based on the data that are analyzed it can be determined a spectral reflectance curve for each crop in different vegetation phases. The paper compare different agriculture plants that are in different soil. The results are very important for next analysis in precision farming.

AB Rice monitoring and production estimation has special significance to China, as rice is the staple grain and accounts for 42% of the crop production in this country. Radar remote sensing is appropriate for monitoring rice because the areas where this crop is cultivated are often cloudy and rainy. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is thus anticipated to be the dominant high-resolution remote sensing data source for agricultural applications in tropical and subtropical regions. IP also provides revisit schedules suitable for agricultural monitoring. This paper presents the results of a study examining the backscatter behavior of rice as a function of time using multitemporal RADARSAT data acquired in 1996 and 1997. A rice-type distribution map was produced, showing four types of rice with different life spans ranging from 80 days to 120 - 125 days. The Life span of a rice crop has significant impact on the yield, as well as on the taste and quality of the rice, with the longer growing varieties having the best taste and the highest productivity. The rice production of three counties and two administrative regions, totaling 5000 km(2), was estimated in this study. The accuracy of the rice classification was found to be 91% (97% after postclassification filtering) providing confidence that multitemporal RADARSAT data is capable of rice mapping. An empirical growth model was then applied to the results of the rice classification, which related radar backscatter values to rice life spans. These life spans could then be used to sum up the production estimates, which were obtained from agronomic models already in use for rice by local agronomists. These models related the yield of rice to their life span based on empirical observations for each type of rice. The resulting productivity estimate could not be compared to any other existing data on yield production for the study-area, but was well received by the local authorities. Based on the studies carried out in the Zhaoqing test site since 1993, it is suggested that rice production estimates require three radar data acquisitions taken at three different stages of crop growth and development. These three growth stages an: at the end of the transplanting and seedling development period, during the ear differentiation period, and at the beginning of the harvest period. Alternatively, if multiparameter radar data is available, only two data acquisitions may be needed. These would be at the end of the transplanting and seedling development period, and at the beginning of the harvest period. This paper also proposes an operational scenario for rice monitoring and production estimation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An integrated method that incorporates the advantages of per-parcel and per-pixel approaches as well as spectral and spatial characteristics was proposed for crop classification of a typical agricultural area in south-east China using SPOT5 HRV data. The co-occurrence texture was employed to evaluate the heterogeneity of the image data. The average parcel textures determined each parcel defined by the crop boundaries to be classified whether on a per-parcel or per-pixel basis. The optimal threshold in the span of texture ranges was detected by trend analysis, which assigned the proportions of each approach in the integration, thus to produce the best integrated classification. It was suggested that this integrated approach can be effectively implemented to produce crop classification maps with higher accuracy from satellite images of medium and high spatial resolution in a complex agricultural environment, where both homogeneous and heterogeneous crop fields occur side by side.

AB The launch of Sentinel-2A and B satellites has boosted the development of many applications that could benefit from the fine resolution of the supplied information, both in time and in space. Crop classification is a necessary task for efficient land management. We evaluated the benefits of combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A information for irrigated crop classification. We also assessed the robustness and efficiency of 22 nonparametric classification algorithms for classifying irrigated crops in a semiarid region in the southeast of Spain. A parcel-based approach was proposed calculating the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each plot and the standard deviation to generate a calibration-testing set of data. More than 2000 visited plots for 12 different crops along the study site were utilized as ground truth. Ensemble classifiers were the most robust algorithms but not the most efficient because of their low prediction rate. Nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines have the best balance between robustness and efficiency as methods for classification. Although the F1 score is close to 90%, some misclassifications were found for spring crops (e.g., barley, wheat and peas). However, crops with quite similar cycles could be differentiated, such as purple garlic and white garlic, showing the powerfulness of the developed tool.

AB Regional process-based (agro-) ecosystem modelling depends mainly on data availability of land use, weather, soil, and agricultural management. While land use, weather, and soil data are available from official sources or can be captured with monitoring systems, management data are usually derived from official statistics for administrative units. For numerous spatial modeling approaches, these data are not satisfying. Especially for process-based agro-ecosystem modeling on regional scales, spatially disaggregated and land use dependent information on agricultural management is a must. Information about date of sowing, dates of fertilization, dates of weeding etc. are required as input parameters by such models. These models consider nitrogen (N)-and carbon (C)-matter fluxes but essential amounts of N-/C-input and N-/C-output are determined by crop management. Therefore, in this contribution a RS-and GIS-based approach for regional generation of management data is introduced. The approach is based on the Multi-data Approach (MDA) for enhanced land use/land cover mapping. The MDA is a combined RS and GIS approach. The retrieved information from multitemporal and multisensoral remote sensing analysis is integrated into official land use data to enhance both the information level of existing land use data and the quality of the land use classification. The workflow of the MDA to generate enhanced land use and land cover data consists basically of two components: (a) the methods and data of the remote sensing analysis and (b) the methods and data of the GIS analysis. The MDA results in disaggregated land use data which can be used to link crop management information about the major crops and especially crop rotations like date of sowing, fertilization, irrigation, harvest etc. to the derived land use classes. Consequently, depending on the land use, a distinct management is given in a spatial context on regional scale. In this contribution, three case studies of different regions in Germany will be presented: (i) the dairy farm region "Wurttembergisches Allgau", (ii) the arable land region "Kraichgau", and (iii) the diverse Rur-Watershed in Western Germany. For each of the study regions, a different MDA-based approach for regionalizing agricultural management is applied and will be discussed.

AB Knowledge on geographical location and distribution of crops at global, national and regional scales is an extremely valuable source of information for many applications. Traditional approaches to crop mapping using remote sensing data rely heavily on reference or ground truth data in order to train/calibrate classification models. As a rule, such models are only applicable to a single vegetation season and should be recalibrated to be applicable for other seasons. This paper addresses the problem of early season large-area winter crop mapping using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series and growing degree days (GDD) information derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) product. The model is based on the assumption that winter crops have developed biomass during early spring while other crops (spring and summer) have no biomass. As winter crop development is temporally and spatially non-uniform due to the presence of different agro-climatic zones, we use GDD to account for such discrepancies. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to discriminate winter crops from other crops (spring and summer). The proposed method has the following advantages: low input data requirements, robustness, applicability to global scale application and can provide winter crop maps 1.5-2 months before harvest. The model is applied to two study regions, the State of Kansas in the US and Ukraine, and for multiple seasons (2001-2014). Validation using the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Data Layer (CDL) for Kansas and ground measurements for Ukraine shows that accuracies of >90% can be achieved in mapping winter crops 1.5-2 months before harvest. Results also show good correspondence to official statistics with average coefficients of determination R-2 > 0.85. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing is providing an increasing number of crucial data about Earth. Systematic revisitation time allows the analysis of long time series as well as imagery utilization in the most interesting moments. Nevertheless, the current huge amount of data makes essential the usage of automatic methods to select the best captures, as many of them are not useful because of clouds, shadows, etc. Because of that, one of the characteristics of the more recent missions is the distribution, along with the spectral data, of a large amount of quality ancillary datasets. These datasets can act synergistically in the aim of selecting the best quality images, but the criteria they provide are not always enough. Indeed, these datasets are often used on a per pixel basis and the spatial pattern of the different spectral bands is forgotten, so ignoring the key information they can provide for our goals. With this aim, our work takes one of the most successful instruments in remote sensing, MODIS, and demonstrates, through geostatistical techniques, that the role of the spatial patterns of the spectral bands can effectively improve image selection in a complex (for climate, relief, and vegetation and crop phenology) region of 63; 700 km(2). The results show that band 01 (red) is the preferred one, as it achieves a 13% higher success than when only using quality bands criteria: a 94% global accuracy (66 true classifications, and only four omissions and one commission error). A second, important finding, is that the geostatistical selection improves results when using any band, except for band 02 (NIR1), which makes our proposal potentially useful for most remote sensing missions. Finally, the method can be executed in a reasonable computing time due to previously developed high-performance computing techniques. (C) The Authors.

TI Statistical learning algorithms for identifying contrasting tillage

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION; WATER
AB Tillage management practices have a direct impact on water-holding capacity, evaporation, carbon sequestration and water quality. This study examines the feasibility of two statistical learning algorithms, namely the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM), for identifying two contrasting tillage management practices using remote-sensing data. LSSVM is firmly based on statistical learning theory, whereas RVM is a probabilistic model where the training takes place in a Bayesian framework. Input to the LSSVM and RVM algorithms were reflectance values at different bandwidths and indices derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ground-truth data for this study were collected from 72 commercial production fields in two counties located in the Texas High Plains of the south-central USA. Numerous LSSVM- and RVM-based tillage models were developed and evaluated for tillage classification accuracy. The percentage correct and kappa statistic were used for the evaluation. The results showed that the best LSSVM and RVM models included the use of TM band 5 or vegetation indices that involved TM band 5, indicating sensitivity of near-infrared reflectance of crop residue cover on the surface. This is consistent with other remote-sensing models reported in the literature. Overall classification accuracies of the best LSSVM and RVM models were 87.8 and 90.2%, respectively. The corresponding kappa statistics for those models were 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, comparison of the best LSSVM and RVM models with the published logistic regression-based tillage models developed with the same data indicated the superiority of the RVM model over LSSVM and logistic regression models in determining contrasting tillage practices with Landsat TM data.

AB We describe the development of tools to exploit the enormous resource of street-level imagery in Google Street View to characterize food cultivation practices along roadside transects at very high spatial resolution as a potential complement to traditional remote sensing approaches. We report on two software tools for crop identification using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to Google Street View imagery. The first, a multi-class classifier distinguishes seven regionally common cultivated plant species, as well as uncultivated vegetation, built environment, and water along the roads. The second, a prototype specialist detector, recognizes the presence of a single plant species: in our case, banana. These two classification tools were tested along roadside transects in two areas of Thailand, a country where there is good Google Street View coverage.
   On the entire test set, the overall accuracy of the multi-class classifier was 83.3%. For several classes, (banana, built, cassava, maize, rice, and sugarcane), the producer's accuracy was over 90%, meaning that the classifier was infrequently making omission errors. This performance on roadside transects is comparable with that of some remote-sensing classifiers, yet ours does not require any additional site-visits for ground-truthing. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the classifier on the 40% of images it is most sure about is excellent: 99.0%. For the prototype specialist detector, the area under the ROC curve was 0.9905, indicating excellent performance in detecting the presence of banana plants.
   While initially tested over the road network in a small area, this technique could readily be deployed on a regional or even national scale to supplement remote sensing data and yield a fine-grained analysis of food cultivation activities along roadside transects.

AB In this manuscript, we tried to improve the performance of the FC-DenseNet by applying an attention gate for the classification of cropping areas. The attention gate module could facilitate the learning of a deep learning model and improve the performance of the model by injecting of spatial/spectral weights to each feature map. Crop classification was performed in the onion and garlic regions using a proposed deep learning model in which an attention gate was added to the skip connection part of FC-DenseNet. Training data was produced using various PlanetScope satellite imagery, and preprocessing was applied to minimize the problem of imbalanced training dataset. As a result of the crop classification, it was verified that the proposed deep learning model can more effectively classify the onion and garlic regions than existing FC-DenseNet algorithm.

AB The availability of accurate information on the water consumed for crop irrigation is of vital importance to support compatible and sustainable environmental policies in arid and semi-arid regions. This has promoted several studies about the use of remote sensing data to monitor irrigated croplands, which are mostly based on statistical classification and/or regression techniques. The current paper proposes a new semi-empirical approach that relies on a water balance logic and does not require local tuning. The method stems from recent investigations which demonstrated the possibility of combining standard meteorological data and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) NDVI images to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of irrigated Mediterranean croplands. This ETa estimation method is adapted to drive a simplified site water balance which, for each 10-m S-2 MSI pixel, predicts the irrigation water (IW), i.e. the water which is consumed in addition to that naturally supplied by rainfall. The new method, fed with ground and satellite data from two years (2018-2019), is tested in a Mediterranean area around the town of Grosseto (Central Italy), that is covered by a particularly complex mosaic of rainfed and irrigated crops. The results obtained are first assessed qualitatively for some fields grown with known winter, spring and summer crops. Next, the IW estimates are evaluated quantitatively versus ground measurements taken over two irrigated fields, the first grown with processing tomato in 2018 and the second with early corn in 2019. Finally, the IW estimates are statistically analyzed against various datasets informative on local agricultural practices in the two years. All these analyses indicate that the proposed method is capable of predicting both the intensity and timing of the IW supply in the study area. The method, in fact, correctly identifies rainfed and irrigated crops and, in the latter case, accurately predicts the IW actually supplied. The results of the quantitative tests performed on tomato and corn show that over 50 % and 70 % of the measured IW variance is explained on daily and weekly bases, respectively, with corresponding mean bias errors below 0.3 mm/day and 2.0 mm/week. Similar indications are produced by the qualitative tests; reasonable IW estimates are obtained for all winter, springs and summer crops grown in the study area during 2018 and 2019.

AB Remote sensing data are nowadays being acquired within short intervals and made available at a low cost or for free. This opens up opportunities for new remote sensing applications, such as the characterization of entire regions to identify most suitable areas for technology targeting. Increasing population growth and changing dietary habits in South Asia call for higher cereal production to ensure future food security. In the Delta area of Bangladesh, surface water is considered to be available in quantities large enough to support intensification by adding an irrigated dry season crop. Fuel-efficient, low lift axial flow pumps have shown to be suitable to carry water to fields that are within a buffer of four hundred meters of the rivers. However, information on how and where to target surface water irrigation efforts is currently lacking. We describe the opportunities and constraints encountered in developing a procedure to identify cropland for which axial flow pumps could be successfully deployed upon in a 43'000 km2 area. First, we isolated cropland and waterways using Landsat 5 and 7 scenes using image segmentation followed by classification with the random forest algorithm. Based on Landsat 7 and 8 scenes, we extracted maximum dry season enhanced vegetation index ( EVI) values, which we classified into fallow, low-, and high-intensity cropland for the last three years. Last, we investigated the potential for surface water irrigation on fallow and low-intensity land by applying a cropping risk matrix to address the twin threats of soil and water salinity. Our analysis indicates that there are at least 20,000 ha of fallow land under the low-risk category, while more than 100,000 ha of low-intensity cropland can be brought into intensified production. This information will aid in technology targeting for the efficient deployment of surface water irrigation as a tool for intensification.

AB While many data sets are increasingly available to describe land cover characteristics, these data require careful analysis and supplemental research before conclusions can be drawn about the scope, magnitude, and drivers of change. Land cover data, typically derived from remote sensing, are frequently analyzed to estimate land use change (LUC) that may be attributable to policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, which encourages bioenergy. However, land cover classifications such as grassland do not clearly differentiate among multiple land uses (pasture, fodder, crop, yard, wildlife corridor, decorative cover, and erosion control strip), many of which may occur on a single parcel simultaneously. A land cover class in one data set rarely corresponds exactly to the same land cover class in another data set. Further, persistent improvements in remote-sensing systems result in changes in spatial and temporal resolutions that lead to changes in classification methodology, which limit the ability to use those data sets to accurately measure changes occurring on the ground. Most LUC estimates are derived by comparing land cover across a few points in time and using aggregate land cover classes such as "forest," "cropland" or "urban." Analyses that cover short time spans or rely on just a few points in time are likely to generate spurious results if dynamic interacting classes such as U.S. cropland and grassland are considered. We review land cover dynamics in the Western Corn Belt (WCB) region, which comprises the U.S. states of Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, to illustrate how the selection and manipulation of data can result in estimates of change associated with the cropland-grassland transition that vary by over 100%.

AB Remote sensing image (RSI) scene classification (RSISC) is a fundamental problem for understanding high-resolution RSIs. More recently, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and large data sets have greatly promoted the RSISC. However, deep learning methods rely heavily on the visual features extracted from the patches cropped from original RSIs, so the intraclass diversity and interclass similarity are two big challenges. To address these problems, in this letter, we propose a spatial information considered model to learn more discriminative features. By combining CNN and recurrent neural network, the proposed method can exploit both local and long-range spatial relation information to enhance the representational ability of the learned features. As the initial visual features of a single patch are transformed into higher-level features with spatial information, the proposed method achieves more accurate scene classification. Besides, we present an RSISC data set named as CSU-RSISC10 data set to preserve the spatial information between scenes in a new way of organization. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other three state-of-the-art methods in scene classification using CSU-RSISC10 data set.

AB Global, timely, accurate and cost-effective cropland mapping is a prerequisite for reliable crop condition monitoring. This article presented a simple and comprehensive methodology capable to meet the requirements of operational cropland mapping by proposing (1) five knowledge-based temporal features that remain stable over time, (2) a cleaning method that discards misleading pixels from a baseline land cover map and (3) a classifier that delivers high accuracy cropland maps (>80%). This was demonstrated over four contrasted agrosystems in Argentina, Belgium, China and Ukraine. It was found that the quality and accuracy of the baseline impact more the certainty of the classification rather than the classification output itself. In addition, it was shown that interpolation of the knowledge-based features increases the stability of the classifier allowing for its re-use from year to year without recalibration. Hence, the method shows potential for application at larger scale as well as for delivering cropland map in near real time. (C) 2015 International Society for Photogrammetiy and Remote Sensing, Inc.

AB For many applied problems in agricultural monitoring and food security, it is important to provide reliable crop classification maps. Satellite imagery is extremely valuable source of data to provide crop maps in a timely way at moderate and high spatial resolution. Information on parcel boundaries that takes into account the spatial context may improve the quality of maps compared to pixel-based classification approaches. In general, parcels may contain several plots with different crops and such situations should be taken into account when using parcel boundaries. In this paper, we aim to compare pixel-based and parcel-based approaches to crop classification from multitemporal optical (Landsat-8) and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 imagery. For this, we propose a parcel-based approach that involves a pixel-based classification map and specifically designed rules to account for several plots within parcel. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv oblast (North of Ukraine) in 2013-2015, and the Odessa oblast (South of Ukraine) in 2014-2015. We found that pixel-based overall classification accuracy can be increased from 85.32% to 89.40% when using parcel boundaries. Among tested parcel-based approaches, the one that relied on pixel-based classification map and a procedure to select multiple plots within the parcel yielded the best performance.

AB The planning of agricultural policy at European and national levels makes use of crop statistics derived from remote sensing data. The main aim of using these data is to obtain regular and reliable crop statistics during the growing season via a monthly crop status bulletin. Optical data are being used on an operational basis to provide agricultural statistics as early as possible in the year because, with the use of satellite imagery, large areas can be covered under the same atmospheric conditions at a very limited cost. But cloud cover poses the greatest restriction on the acquisition of data that may be required at different intervals. This limitation has been somewhat alleviated by the use of Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) which are essentially all-weather systems. A number of works have already reported the use of SAR intensity images for land use classification. Another SAR-based technique, called SAR interferometry, uses two single look complex (or SLC) SAR images which contain both amplitude and phase information. Coherence images can be produced from two SLC images, often as part of the interferogram generation process.
   This study was carried to study the impact of the use of texture features derived from coherence and intensity images on land use classification accuracy, in combination with coherence and intensity images. For this study, five SLC images covering a period from 02/05/1996 to 20/09/1996 were selected. The classification problem involved the identification of seven land cover types; namely, wheat, potato, sugar beet, onion, peas, barley and carrots that cover the bulk of the area of interest. Interferometric processing was carried out using all five SLC images. Five intensity and three coherence images were obtained and it was found that only the tandem pair (02/05/1996 and 03/05/1996) provided good quality coherence images. Texture features based on the GLCM, Markov random fields, local statistics, and fractals were derived from all intensity and the coherence images for further use in image classification. As the number of input features become large for classification, a feature selection based on a statistical measure called Hotelling's T-2 was carried out to select the three best features for each intensity and coherence image. Five different data sets (1) five median filtered intensity images, (2) median filtered coherence and five intensity images, (3) median filtered coherence and three texture features of coherence images and five intensity images, (4) data set (1) with texture features and, (5) data set (2) with texture features were used in this study. Three different classifiers (ML, neural and decision tree) were used.
   Results suggests that the classification based on data set (2) is about 9% more accurate than data set (1) with all the classification system used thus, suggesting that the incorporation of coherence information can be very useful for land cover classification, in combination with intensity images. By using the texture features of all the images (data set (5)) an overall classification accuracy of more than 82% was achieved, which suggests that the use of texture features derived from InSAR data can results in acceptable levels of accuracy being attained for land cover classification. This study also suggests that a decision tree classifier can be used very effectively for land cover classification studies involving radar data.

AB Cruciferous weeds are competitive broad-leaved species that cause losses in winter crops. In the present study, research on remote sensing was conducted on seven naturally infested fields located in Crdoba and Seville, southern Spain. Multi-spectral aerial images (four bands, including blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared bands) taken in April 2007 were used to evaluate the feasibility of mapping cruciferous patches (Diplotaxis spp. and Sinapis spp.) in winter crops (wheat, broad bean and pea) and compare the accuracy of different supervised classification methods (vegetation indices, maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper). The best classification method was selected to develop site-specific cruciferous treatment maps. Cruciferous patches were efficiently discriminated with red/blue (R/B) and blue/green (B/G) vegetation indices and the maximum likelihood classifier. At all of the locations, the accuracy of the results obtained from the spectral angler mapper was relatively low. The cruciferous weed-classified imagery of each location were created according to the method that provided the best discrimination results and were used to obtain site-specific treatment maps for in-season post-emergence control measures or herbicide applications for subsequent years. By applying the site-specific treatment maps, herbicide savings from 71.7 to 95.4% for the no-treatment areas and from 4.3 to 12% for the low-dose herbicide were obtained.

AB The remote-sensing based Flood Crop Loss Assessment Service System (RF-CLASS) is a web service based system developed and managed by the Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS). The system uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based flood data, which was implemented by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO), to provide an estimation of crop loss from floods. However, due to the spectral similarity between water and shadow, a noticeable amount of false classification of shadow can be found in the DFO flood products. Traditional methods can be utilized to remove cloud shadow and part of mountain shadow. This paper aims to develop an algorithm to filter out noise from permanent mountain shadow in the flood layer. The result indicates that mountain shadow was significantly removed by using the proposed approach. In addition, the gold standard test indicated a small number of actual water surfaces were misidentified by the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, experiments also suggest that increasing the spatial resolution of the slope helped reduce more noise in mountains. The proposed algorithm achieved acceptable overall accuracy (>80%) in all different filters and higher overall accuracies were observed when using lower slope filters. This research is one of the very first discussions on identifying false flood classification from terrain shadow by using the highly efficient method.

AB Cover cropping is a conservation practice that helps to alleviate soil health problems and reduce nutrient losses. Understanding the spatial variability in historic and current adoption of cover cropping practices and their impacts on soil, water, and nutrient dynamics at a landscape scale is an important step in determining and prioritizing areas in a watershed to effectively utilize this practice. However, such data are lacking. Our objective was to develop a spatial and temporal inventory of winter cover cropping practices in the Maumee River watershed using images collected by Landsat satellites (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) from 2008 to 2019 in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Each year, satellite images collected during cover crop growing season (i.e., between October and April) were converted into two seasonal composites based on cover crop phenology. Using these composites, various image-based covariates were extracted for 628 ground-truth (field) data. By integrating ground-truth and image-based covariates, a cover crop classification model based on a random forest (RF) algorithm was developed, trained and validated in GEE platform. Our classification scheme differentiated four cover crop categories: Winter Hardy, Winter Kill, Spring Emergent, and No Cover. The overall classification accuracy was 75%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.63. The results showed that more than 50% of the corn-soybean areas in the Maumee River watershed were without winter crops during 2008-2019 period. It was found that 2019/2020 and 2009/2010 were the years with the largest and lowest cover crop areas, with 34% and 10% in the watershed, respectively. The total cover cropping area was then assessed in relation to fall precipitation and cumulative growing degree days (GDD). There was no apparent increasing trend in cover crop areas between 2008 and 2019, but the variability in cover crops areas was found to be related to higher accumulated GDD and fall precipitation. A detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of cover crops using GEE could help in promoting site-specific management practices to enhance their environmental benefits. This also has significance to policy makers and funding agencies as they could use the information to localize areas in need of interventions for supporting adoption of cover cropping practice.

AB Spatial and temporal information on plant and soil conditions is needed urgently for monitoring of crop productivity. Remote sensing has been considered as an effective means for crop growth monitoring due to its timely updating and complete coverage. In this paper, we explored the potential of L-band fully-polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data for crop monitoring and classification. The study site was located in the Sacramento Valley, in California where the cropping system is relatively diverse. Full season polarimetric signatures, as well as scattering mechanisms, for several crops, including almond, walnut, alfalfa, winter wheat, corn, sunflower, and tomato, were analyzed with linear polarizations (HH, HV, and VV) and polarimetric decomposition (Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden) parameters, respectively. The separability amongst crop types was assessed across a full calendar year based on both linear polarizations and decomposition parameters. The unique structure-related polarimetric signature of each crop was provided by multitemporal UAVSAR data with a fine temporal resolution. Permanent tree crops (almond and walnut) and alfalfa demonstrated stable radar backscattering values across the growing season, whereas winter wheat and summer crops (corn, sunflower, and tomato) presented drastically different patterns, with rapid increase from the emergence stage to the peak biomass stage, followed by a significant decrease during the senescence stage. In general, the polarimetric signature was heterogeneous during June and October, while homogeneous during March-to-May and July-to-August. The scattering mechanisms depend heavily upon crop type and phenological stage. The primary scattering mechanism for tree crops was volume scattering (> 40%), while surface scattering (> 40%) dominated for alfalfa and winter wheat, although double-bounce scattering (> 30%) was notable for alfalfa during March-to-September. Surface scattering was also dominant (> 40%) for summer crops across the growing season except for sunflower and tomato during June and corn during July-to-October when volume scattering (> 40%) was the primary scattering mechanism. Crops were better discriminated with decomposition parameters than with linear polarizations, and the greatest separability occurred during the peak biomass stage (July-August). All crop types were completely separable from the others when simultaneously using UAVSAR data spanning the whole growing season. The results demonstrate the feasibility of L-band SAR for crop monitoring and classification, without the need for optical data, and should serve as a guideline for future research.

AB The southeastern United States, including the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, had a high occurrence of fire activity as detected by the I km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TERRA Active Fire Product (MOD 14). The analysis of the satellite data from 2001 to 2004 showed that agricultural burning in the southeastern United States accounted for an average of 16% of annual fire activity. The southeastern region contributed an average of 33% of all agricultural burning detected in the contiguous United States. Crop residues that burned in the southeast included rice, winter wheat, sugarcane, soybean and cotton. Much of the agricultural burning occurred in June and from October to January and was related to the harvest of winter wheat and rice in the spring and the harvest of sugarcane, soybean and cotton in the fall and winter. The results showed that cropland burning was spatially dependent on crop type and temporally dependent on management practices (planting harvesting). Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana contributed more than 75% of all agricultural burning in the southeast. A 250 in MODIS land cover map cover for 2004 was developed for these three states using a decision tree classification and validation from a field campaign in the fall of 2004. Compared to the standard MODIS I kin Land Cover Dataset (MOD 12) product ([Friedl, M. A., McIver, D. K., Hodges, J. C. F., Zhang, X. Y., Muchoney, D., Strahler, A. H., Woodcock, C.

Results from the decision tree classification for each state revealed that in 2004 agricultural burning contributed 73%, 54%, and 33% of total fires for Arkansas, Florida, and Louisiana, respectively.

AB A methodology is developed for mapping spatial variability of available nutrients of soils of a pocket growing potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crop using GIS. For this purpose potato growing pockets of the Jalandhar district were demarcated based on the available information, ground truth and classification of the IRS P6 AWiFS image. The classified potato area in the image was taken as background to generate the sampling site map and representative soil samples of potato fields from these sites were collected along with geographical coordinates using GPS receiver (E-TREX-VISTA, Garmin). Values of different parameters (like pH, OC, available P and K and micronutrients) were tagged with corresponding points and interpolation maps for each individual parameters were prepared using suitable semivariogram and kriging in remote sensing GIS software. These prepared maps were further classified giving suitable ranges of different soil parameters.

AB Accurate and timely crop mapping is crucial for environment assessment, food security and agricultural production. However, for the areas with high landscape heterogeneity and frequent cloudy and rainy weather, the insufficient high-quality satellite images limit the accuracy of crop classification. The recently launched Chinese GF-6 wide field-of-view camera (WFV) with a revisit cycle of 4-day and spatial resolution of 16-meter shows great potential for agricultural monitoring. In this study, Qianjiang City characterized by complex agricultural landscapes was selected as the research area to assess the potential of GF-6 data in identifying crop types. Firstly, the pairwise and global separability were calculated to analyze the effect of different spectral-temporal features of GF-6 images on crop classification. A total of 255 spectral-temporal features derived from 15 GF-6 tiles were then used to perform random forest classification. Furthermore, the classification results were evaluated based on 671 field samples and then compared the accuracy between GF-6 data and Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8 data. In addition, the earliest identifiable time of crop types was also determined by iteratively using all available GF-6 data during each time period. The results suggested that the overall accuracy (OA) of all available GF-6 images was 91.55%, which was significantly higher than that of Landsat-8 data (OA = 85.97%) and was slightly lower than that of Sentinel-2 data (OA = 93.10%). The newly added red-edge bands (0.69 0.73 mu m, 0.73 0.77 mu m) and their derivative vegetation indices were important spectral features, and the period from mid-March to early-April was the best temporal window for crop identification in our research area. Moreover, late July was the earliest crop identifiable time with overall accuracy of 90% for the first time of the year. These results indicated the great potential of GF-6 images for classifying crop types in the areas with complex cropping system and fragmented agricultural landscapes, particularly when integrating other satellite data with comparable spatial resolution (e.g. Chinese GF-1 data and Sentinel-2 data).

ID EM ALGORITHM
AB A new approach to the classification of hyperspectral images is proposed. The main problem with supervised methods is that the learning process heavily depends on the quality of the training data set. In remote sensing, the training set is useful only for simultaneous images or for images with the same classes taken under the same conditions; and, even worse, the training set is frequently not available. On the other hand, unsupervised methods are not sensitive to the number of labelled samples since they work on the whole image. Nevertheless, relationship between clusters and classes is not ensured. In this context, we propose a combined strategy of supervised and unsupervised learning methods that avoids these drawbacks and automates the classification process. The method is based on the general formulation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This method is applied to crop cover recognition of six hyperspectral images from the same area acquired with the HyMap spectrometer during the DAISEX-99 campaign. For classification purposes, six different classes are considered. Classification accuracy results are compared to common methods: ISODATA, Learning Vector Quantization, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood, Expectation-Maximization, and Neural Networks. The good performance confirms the validity of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB Recently, agricultural remote sensing community has endeavored to utilize the power of artificial intelligence (AI). One important topic is using AI to make the mapping of crops more accurate, automatic, and rapid. This article proposed a classification workflow using deep neural network (DNN) to produce high-quality in-season crop maps from Landsat imageries for North Dakota. We use historical crop maps from the agricultural department and North Dakota ground measurements as training datasets. Processing workflows are created to automate the tedious preprocessing, training, testing, and postprocessing workflows. We tested this hybrid solution on new images and received accurate results on major crops such as corn, soybean, barley, spring wheat, dry beans, sugar beets, and alfalfa. The pixelwise overall accuracy in all three test regions is over 82% for all land types (including noncrop land), which is the same level of accuracy as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer. The texture of DNN maps is more consistent with fewer noises, which is more comfortable to read. We find DNN is better on recognizing big farmlands than recognizing the scattered wetlands and suburban regions in North Dakota. The model trained on multiple scenes of multiple years and months yields higher accuracy than any of the models trained only on a single scene, a single month, or a single year. These results reflect that DNN can produce reliable in-season maps for major crops in North Dakota big farms and could provide a relatively accurate reference for the minor crops in scattered wetland fields.

AB Accurate and timely information about production estimates of wheat is useful for policymakers and government planners. The traditional methods for yield forecasting are labor insensitive and time-consuming therefore remote sensing is an effective approach for precise yield forecasting. The study was planned to develop a comprehensive framework for yield forecasting and to assess interannual yield variability in semi-arid regions. For wheat area classification, the peak season Landsat-8 satellite images were acquired, and Top of Atmospheric (TOA) correction was performed. The ground-truthing points of 100 farms were collected from the study area for the training of algorithms. The eight machine learning algorithms were used tune and tested using 10-k fold cross-validation and the best model was used for land cover classification of wheat. For yield forecasting, the temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were derived for the wheat-growing season from November to April. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to variable selection and then Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) analysis was performed to develop coefficients of the yield forecasting model. The developed model was further used in yield forecasting of 10 years (2008-2018) in four semi-arid regions. The predicted yield was compared with Crop Reporting Service (CRS), Pakistan department. The results of all machine learning algorithms showed an accuracy of 88% to 96%, however, the Random forest algorithm showed higher accuracy, which was further used for classification. The wheat estimated area of 6.9% was less than reported by CRS. For interannual variability, the relationship of observed (CRS) and predicted yield of 10 years showed a close relation with R-2 ranged from 0.69 to 0.75 in the semi-arid region of Punjab, Pakistan. It was concluded that machine learning algorithms can be used as novel tools for yield forecasting and assessment of interannual yield variability.

AB The identification and mapping of crops are important for estimating potential harvest as well as for agricultural field management. Optical remote sensing is one of the most attractive options because it offers vegetation indices and some data have been distributed free of charge. Especially, Sentinel-2A, which is equipped with a multispectral sensor (MSI) with blue, green, red, and near-infrared-1 bands at 10 m; red edge 1 to 3, near-infrared-2, and shortwave infrared 1 and 2 at 20 m; and 3 atmospheric bands (band 1, band 9, and band 10) at 60 m, offer some vegetation indices calculated to assess vegetation status. However, sufficient consideration has not been given to the potential of vegetation indices calculated from MSI data. Thus, 82 published indices were calculated and their importance were evaluated for classifying crop types. The two most common classification algorithms, random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to conduct cropland classification from MSI data. Additionally, super learning was applied for more improvement, achieving overall accuracies of 90.2% to 92.2%. Of the two algorithms applied (RF and SVM), the accuracy of SVM was superior and 89.3% to 92.0% of overall accuracies were confirmed. Furthermore, stacking contributed to higher overall accuracies (90.2% to 92.2%), and significant differences were confirmed with the results of SVM and RF. Our results showed that vegetation indices had the greatest contributions in identifying specific crop types. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Timely and accurate crop classification is of enormous significance for agriculture management. The Shiyang River Basin, an inland river basin, is one of the most prominent water resource shortage regions with intensive agriculture activities in northwestern China. However, a free crop map with high spatial resolution is not available in the Shiyang River Basin. The European Space Agency (ESA) satellite Sentinel-2 has multi-spectral bands ranging in the visible-red edge-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-RE-NIR-SWIR) spectrum. Understanding the impact of spectral-temporal information on crop classification is helpful for users to select optimized spectral bands combinations and temporal window in crop mapping when using Sentinel-2 data. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data acquired in the growing season in 2019 were applied to the random forest algorithm to generate the crop classification map at 10 m spatial resolution for the Shiyang River Basin. Four experiments with different combinations of feature sets were carried out to explore which Sentinel-2 information was more effective for higher crop classification accuracy. The results showed that the augment of multi-spectral and multi-temporal information of Sentinel-2 improved the accuracy of crop classification remarkably, and the improvement was firmly related to strategies of feature selections. Compared with other bands, red-edge band 1 (RE-1) and shortwave-infrared band 1 (SWIR-1) of Sentinel-2 showed a higher competence in crop classification. The combined application of images in the early, middle and late crop growth stage is significant for achieving optimal performance. A relatively accurate classification (overall accuracy = 0.94) was obtained by utilizing the pivotal spectral bands and dates of image. In addition, a crop map with a satisfied accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.9) could be generated as early as late July. This study gave an inspiration in selecting targeted spectral bands and period of images for acquiring more accurate and timelier crop map. The proposed method could be transferred to other arid areas with similar agriculture structure and crop phenology.

AB In this paper, cadastre agricultural cartography was enriched using crop roster maps obtained from remote sensing images. The work demonstrates the implications of applying two new, terms: fidelity and purity, Per-pixel classifications and polygon enrichments were compared taking into account: (a) the consequences of using a more or less conservative strategy at the classification stage, using fidelity, and (b) the consequences Of using modal thresholds at the enrichment stage when deciding which category each polygon is to be assigned to, using purity. More than 300,000 pixels and 2,800 polygons were used to measure the thematic accuracy of ten agricultural categories by means of confusion matrices. These were computed at pixel, polygon, and area level. Thematic accuracy was calculated in the classical way and without taking into account unclassified pixels as errors, as well as by paying special attention to the consequences for the classified area. The results show that polygon enrichment is a useful methodology, achieving thematic accuracies of 95.6 percent, when optimum parameters are used, while classifying 87.4 percent of the area.

AB There is a need to intensify research efforts on improving productivity of indigenous vegetables in South Africa. One research avenue is operationalizing remote sensing techniques to monitor crop health status. This study aimed at characterising the spectral properties of Chinese cabbage (Brassica Rapa L. subspecies Chinensis) grown under varying fertilizer treatments: nitrogen (0 kg/ha, 75 kg/ha, 125 kg/ha, 175 kg/ha and 225 kg/ha), phosphorus (0 kg/ha, 9.4 kg/ha, 15.6, 21.9 kg/ha and 28.1 kg/ha) and potassium (0 kg/ha, 9.4 kg/ha, 15.6 kg/ha, 21.9 kg/ha and 28.1 kg/ha). Visible and infrared spectral measurements were taken from a total of 60 samples inside the laboratory. Contiguous spectral regions were plotted to show spectral profiles of the different fertilizer treatments and then classified using gradient boosting and random forest classifiers. ANOVA revealed the potential of spectral reflectance data in discriminating different fertiliser treatments from crops. There was also a significant difference between the capabilities of the two classifiers. Gradient boost model (GBM) yielded higher classification accuracies than random forest (RF). The important variables identified by each model improved the classification accuracy. Overall, the results indicate a potential for the use of spectroscopy in monitoring food quality parameters, thereby reducing the cost of traditional methods. Further research into advanced statistical analysis techniques is needed to improve the accuracy with which fertiliser concentrations in crops could be quantified. The random forest model particularly requires improvements.

AB In agriculture, land use knowledge is very important for the analysis of agricultural, to estimate production and propose crop production forecast models, environmental monitoring and sustainable planning. Therefore, to coffee agribusiness the mapping of cultivated areas is essential. In the southern region of Minas Gerais, this mapping has been performed using geotechnologies. However, this strategy has some limitations resulting in maps of land use with classification errors. In this work, the proposed solution to minimize this problem is the combination of remote sensing with citizen science. For this purpose, a mobile application, named Demarcafe, has been developed. The Demarcafe allows citizens (non-researchers) to collaborate with this mapping. Hence, the technology assumes the role of facilitator of this connection. The Demarcafe has been evaluated and the results suggest that the tool can represent an important advance in this mapping.

AB Traditional artificial statistical methods of hailstorm damage assessment are often inefficient, subjective, time-consuming, and inaccurate. The use of drones for high-resolution remote sensing imaging enables large-scale, rapid assessment of a target area. The purpose of this study was to use multispectral imaging techniques to promptly and accurately assess the damage degree of hail in crops. In this experiment, cotton was used as the research target, and the experiment was carried out after a hail disaster that occurred during the flowering and boll stage of cotton development. A hail vegetation index (HGVI) was constructed and compared with the classification results of other vegetation indices on the hail disaster degree. It was concluded that: (i) both the hail vegetation index HGVI and the previous vegetation index, ratio vegetation index, are suitable tools of classification for grading cotton hail disasters, with both indices having a Kappa coefficient over 0.85 and a median Kappa coefficient greater than 0.9; (ii) the method used in this study is suitable for simple classification based on multispectral images; (iii) this study explains the possibility of classifying hail damage degrees based on multispectral images. Subsequent research can further diagnose and classify hail disasters during different periods and improve the accuracy and completeness of classification.

AB Monitoring crop phenology is of great importance for vegetation classification, yield estimation, and irrigation and fertilization management. To test the ability of ground-based remote sensing in detecting major phenological dates of rice, canopy spectra were collected by two portable spectrometers. The Red-edge Chlorophyll Index (CIred edge) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series derived from ground-based spectrometers were employed to detect the main specific phenological dates. CIred edge was obtained from ASD FieldSpec Pro spectrometer, while NDVI was from ASD FieldSpec Pro spectrometer (referred to as NDVIASD) and GreenSeeker RT 100 (referred to as NDVIGS). The phenology detection method consists of two procedures: (i) smoothing the temporal CIred edge and NDVI data with the double logistic regression function to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics, (ii) determining the phenological dates through extracting the maximum, minimum and zero-crossing points (FDmax, FDmin and FDzero,) from the first derivative value of the smoothed NDVI and CIred (edge) temporal profiles. A comparison of remote sensing-based estimates with field observations over three growing seasons with different cultivars, planting densities and nitrogen (N) rates showed that CIred (edge) can accurately estimate the dates of jointing, middle booting and dough grain. NDVI from both spectrometers can be used to detect the dates of active tillering, middle heading and maturity. Specifically, NDVIGS yielded better performance than NDVIASD for estimating the three phenological dates. Compared with growing season and planting density, rice cultivar and N rate exhibited more significant impact on the accuracy for phenology detection. This work has great potential to provide valuable support for assessing crop growth status and providing precise management strategy. The dates of active tillering, jointing and maturity detected from a combination of CIred edge and NDVI could be useful for irrigation and fertilization management, and harvest determination, respectively.

AB The pure spectra acquisition of plant disease symptoms is essential to improving the reliability of remote sensing methods in crop protection. The reflectance values read from the pure spectra can be used as valuable training data for development of algorithms designed for plant disease detection at leaf and canopy scale. The aim of this paper is to identify and distinguish spectrally the leaf rust symptoms caused by two closely related special forms (f. sp.) of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici on wheat and Puccinia recondita f. sp. recondita on rye at leaf scale. Spectral measurements were made with FieldSpec 3 spectrometer in the wavelength range of 350-2500 nm. The spectrometer was connected to a microscope by optical fiber. Raw spectra of uredinia, chlorotic discoloration, green leaves, senescent inoculated leaves and senescent uninoculated leaves of wheat and rye, all of which obtained for this study, were investigated with a view towards making an automized classification of plant species and their phases. The created Random Forest models were tested separately using pure spectra, and from these vegetation indices were derived as predictors. Three vegetation indices, namely CRI, PRI and GNDVI, appeared to be the most robust in terms of distinguishing uredinia from other symptoms on rye and wheat leaves. PRI, EVI, NDVI705, and GNDVI were the most suitable for distinguishing uredinia, chlorotic discoloration, and green leaf stages on rye. That tusk on wheat leaves can be recognized if seven indices (PRI, MSAWI, SAVI, NDVI, NDVI705, GNDVI and RVI) are used together. For the classification of all disease symptoms for both plant species, the most useful were wavelengths in the VIS range: 431-436, 696-703 and 646-686 nm. However, the ranges of SWIR wavelengths (1938, 1955) and NIR wavelengths (1099-1104) also have a high contribution to the discrimination accuracy of the model. In the classification of all disease symptoms, the most important vegetation indices were CRI, OSAVI, and GNDVI. Analysis of the results revealed the advantage of the model based on the selected spectral wavelengths (Hit Rate of 96.6%) in comparison with predictions based on vegetation indices alone (Hit Rate of 91.7%). Both approaches show the highly applicable character of utilizing high quality spectral products such as satellite images in reducing operational costs of crop protection.

AB This article deals with the agriculture, as part of the primary sector of the economy, includes the transformation of the natural environment through a set of actions and human intervention that allows satisfying the production mainly of food and derived raw materials. Therefore, with the high demand for products required for agricultural activity, it is necessary to implement new technologies to guarantee the quality and performance of production techniques and reduce environmental impact. In this context, precision agriculture has emerged to improve, evaluate, estimate and understand, based on the information obtained, the needs of crops. Taking into account the evolution of the methodology for processing of satellite images and the obtaining of indirect data, a classification of the characteristics of crop yield can be made. Definitely, different techniques have been applied to the processing of satellite images, but recently a current approach, both in effectiveness and speed in obtaining excellent results is the use of deep learning of the convolution of neural networks. The deep convolution of neural networks is used both in the recognition as well as in the classification of the satellite images of the sugarcane plantation in the Troncal region of the Coast of Ecuador. The experiment showed affirmative results of approximately 95% probability of recognition of crop status. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Precision agriculture and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are revolutionizing agriculture management methods. Remote sensing data, image analysis and Digital Surface Models derived from Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereopsis offer new and fast methods to detect the needs of crops, greatly improving crops efficiency. In this study, we present a tool to detect and estimate crop damage after a disturbance (i.e., weather event, wildlife attacks or fires). The types of damage that are addressed in this study affect crop structure (i.e., plants are bent or gone), in the shape of depressions in the crop canopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four unsupervised methods based on terrain analyses, for the detection of damaged crops in UAV 3D models: slope detection, variance analysis, geomorphology classification and cloth simulation filter. A full workflow was designed and described in this article that involves the postprocessing of the raw results from the terrain analyses, for a refinement in the detection of damages. Our results show that all four methods performed similarly well after postprocessing-reaching an accuracy above to 90%-in the detection of severe crop damage, without the need of training data. The results of this study suggest that the used methods are effective and independent of the crop type, crop damage and growth stage. However, only severe damages were detected with this workflow. Other factors such as data volume, processing time, number of processing steps and spatial distribution of targets and errors are discussed in this article for the selection of the most appropriate method. Among the four tested methods, slope analysis involves less processing steps, generates the smallest data volume, is the fastest of methods and resulted in best spatial distribution of matches. Thus, it was selected as the most efficient method for crop damage detection.

AB Successful development of approaches to quantify impacts of diverse landuse and associated agricultural management practices on ecosystem services is frequently limited by lack of historical and contemporary landuse data. We hypothesized that ground truth data from one year could be used to extrapolate previous or future landuse in a complex landscape where cropping systems do not generally change greatly from year to year because the majority of crops are established perennials or the same annual crops grown on the same fields over multiple years. Prior to testing this hypothesis, it was first necessary to classify 57 major landuses in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon from 2005 to 2011 using normal same year ground-truth, elaborating on previously published work and traditional sources such as Cropland Data Layers (CDL) to more fully include minor crops grown in the region. Available remote sensing data included Landsat, MODIS 16-day composites, and National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, all of which were resampled to a common 30 m resolution. The frequent presence of clouds and Landsat7 scan line gaps forced us to conduct of series of separate classifications in each year, which were then merged by choosing whichever classification used the highest number of cloud- and gap-free bands at any given pixel. Procedures adopted to improve accuracy beyond that achieved by maximum likelihood pixel classification included majority-rule reclassification of pixels within 91,442 Common Land Unit (CLU) polygons, smoothing and aggregation of areas outside the CLU polygons, and majority-rule reclassification over time of forest and urban development areas. Final classifications in all seven years separated annually disturbed agriculture, established perennial crops, forest, and urban development from each other at 90 to 95% overall 4-class validation accuracy. In the most successful use of subsequent year ground-truth data to classify prior year landuse, an overall 57-class accuracy of 75% was achieved despite the omission of 10 entire classes, most of which were annually disturbed or perennial crops grown on very few fields. Synthetic ground-truth data for the 2004 harvest year based on the most common landuse classes over the following 7 years classified 49 of 57 categories at an overall accuracy of 96% in a final version that included CLU polygon majority rule, default smoothing and aggregation, and forcing of urban development and forest from multi-year majority-rule.

Specifically, a recently proposed genetic fuzzy rule-based classification system (GFRBCS) is employed, namely, the Hierarchical Rule-based Linguistic Classifier (HiRLiC). HiRLiC's model comprises a small set of simple IF-THEN fuzzy rules, easily interpretable by humans. One of its most important attributes is that its learning algorithm requires minimum user interaction, since the most important learning parameters affecting the classification accuracy are determined by the learning algorithm automatically. HiRLiC is applied in a challenging crop classification task, using a SPOT5 satellite image over an intensively cultivated area in a lake-wetland ecosystem in northern Greece. A rich set of higher-order spectral and textural features is derived from the initial bands of the (pan-sharpened) image, resulting in an input space comprising 119 features. The experimental analysis proves that HiRLiC compares favorably to other interpretable classifiers of the literature, both in terms of structural complexity and classification accuracy. Its testing accuracy was very close to that obtained by complex state-of-the-art classification systems, such as the support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Nevertheless, visual inspection of the derived classification maps shows that HiRLiC is characterized by higher generalization properties, providing more homogeneous classifications that the competitors. Moreover, the runtime requirements for producing the thematic map was orders of magnitude lower than the respective for the competitors.

AB The German Remote Sensing Data Center operates the Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology Model, a process model that estimates the net primary productivity of agricultural areas. The model is driven by remote sensing data and meteorological data. Remotely sensed datasets including a time series of the leaf area index, which describes vegetation condition, and a land cover classification, which provides information about land use, are needed. Currently leaf area indices and land cover data derived from the sensor vegetation are used. Both datasets have spatial resolutions of about 1 km x 1. km and are freely available for the area of investigation (Germany and Austria). The meteorological input parameters are air temperature (at 2 m height), precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed (at 10 m height) and soil water content (in the four uppermost soil layers); these are obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, with a spatial resolution of about 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees and a temporal resolution up to four times daily. The output of the model, the gross primary productivity, is calculated at daily resolution. By subtracting the cumulative plant maintenance and growth respiration, the net primary productivity is then determined. In order to validate the modelled net primary productivity, crop yield estimates derived from the national statistics of Germany and Austria are used. After estimating above-ground biomass using plant-specific above- to below-ground ratios, conversion factors (corn-to-straw and leaf-to-beet relations) are applied to estimate total biomass. Finally the carbon content of dry matter is estimated. To correlate model results with these statistical data, the modelled data are aggregated to net primary productivity per administrative district. The results show that a process model using remote sensing data as input can deliver reliable estimates of agricultural biomass potential which are highly con-elated with statistically derived estimates of actual biomass produced.

AB Hyperspectral data acquired by the Hyperion instrument, on board the Earth Observing - 1 Satellite (EO-1), were evaluated for the classification of five agricultural crops (maize (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), rice (Chyza Sativa), tobacco (Nicotiana Tabacwn) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)) in Greece and the results were compared to classification of Landsat 5 TM data. In addition, was investigated the contribution of Hyperion SWIR bands on crops classification. The research was conducted in an agricultural area located in the North-Eastern Greece. The Hyperion radiance values, from the 196 bands, were converted into surface reflectance values using the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model which is embedded in ENVI software. The data dimensionality reduction of Hyperion's image bands was achieved by using MNF transformation whereas the Maximum Likelihood algorithm was used in order to perform image data classification. The results showed that an overall accuracy of 91% was obtained from the classification of Hyperion image, while the overall accuracy resulted from the classification of Landsat 5 TM image was 81%. Also the Hyperion SWIR bands provide additional information on crops classification, not available by VNIR bands.

AB We present a novel approach for detailed crop type and tree species classification exploiting high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2A data. Here, we address the challenge of frequent cloud coverage in satellite observations by defining, purely data driven, adaptable time periods to create image composites from training pixels. A set of composites from all established time periods within the classification year serve as multi-temporal input data for an adaptable classification approach that uses multiple random forest models for a Germany-wide pixel-based land-use classification. For crop types, we achieved an overall classification accuracy of 88.5 %. The same method will be applied for nationwide tree species mapping. A pre-study on tree species identification showed an an overall accuracy of 74.7 %. The map was used to define tree species composition to better determing conservation status of forests.

AB The area of the research is a part of the Landscape Park and belongs to agri-environment ecosystem of South-West Poland. The study on vegetation growth conditions has been carried out applying optical data from TERRA/ASTER, TERRA/MODIS, and ENVISAT/MERIS as well as microwave data from ENVISAT/ASAR. In situ data collected at the time of satellite observations were as follows: soil moisture, leaf area index, biomass, vegetation moisture, crop height, types of crop and its actual vegetation phenological stage. The supervised maximum likelihood classification method was applied to multispectral optical and multitemporal microwave satellite data to distinguish different crop type. From optical satellite data different vegetation and soil moisture indices have been calculated on the basis of surface reflectance and surface temperature supported with meteorological data. Assessment of heat fluxes applying surface temperature calculated from TERRA/ASTER and TERRA/MODIS images was very important for water balance assessment. From microwave satellite data, registered in various polarisations and incidence angles, the backscattering coefficients have been derived and related to soil moisture. It was presented that the classification obtained from ENVISAT ASAR VV HH IS4 and IS6 and assessment of soil moisture yield into good results close to these obtained from optical data, what is very important in regard to often cloud cover. It was very important to get evapotranspiration from optical data. The results should be implemented into management of agri-environment ecosystem. ENVISAT images have been obtained from ESA for CAT-1 1427 project, TERRA images for the national project 4T12E02630.

AB One of the problems in dealing with optical images for large territories (more than 10,000 sq. km) is the presence of clouds and shadows that result in having missing values in data sets. In this paper, a new approach to classification of multi-temporal optical satellite imagery with missing data due to clouds and shadows is proposed. First, self-organizing Kohonen maps (SOMs) are used to restore missing pixel values in a time series of satellite imagery. SOMs are trained for each spectral band separately using non-missing values. Missing values are restored through a special procedure that substitutes input sample's missing components with neuron's weight coefficients. After missing data restoration, a supervised classification is performed for multi-temporal satellite images. An ensemble of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is proposed. Ensembling of neural networks is done by the technique of average committee, i.e. to calculate the average class probability over classifiers and select the class with the highest average posterior probability for the given input sample. The proposed approach is applied for regional scale crop classification using multi temporal Landsat-8 images for the JECAM test site in Ukraine in 2013. It is shown that ensemble of MLPs provides better performance than a single neural network in terms of overall classification accuracy, kappa coefficient, and producer's and user's accuracies for separate classes. The overall accuracy more than 85% is achieved. The obtained classification map is also validated through estimated crop areas and comparison to official statistics.

AB Accurate crop planting area information is of significance for understanding regional food security and agricultural development planning. While increasing numbers of medium resolution satellite imagery and improved classification algorithms have been used for crop mapping, limited efforts have been made in feature selection, despite its vital impacts on crop classification. Furthermore, different crop types have their unique spectral and phenology characteristics; however, the different features of individual crop types have not been well understood and considered in previous studies of crop mapping. Here, we examined an optimized strategy to integrate specific features of individual crop types for mapping an improved crop type layer in the Sanjiang Plain, a new food bowl in China, by using all Sentinel-2 time series images in 2018. First, an automatic spectro-temporal feature selection (ASTFS) method was used to obtain optimal features for individual crops (rice, corn, and soybean), including sorting all features by the global separability indices for each crop and removing redundant features by accuracy changes when adding new features. Second, the ASTFS-based optimized feature sets for individual crops were used to produce three crop probability maps with the Random Forest classifier. Third, the probability maps were then composited into the final crop layer by considering the probability of each crop at every pixel. The resultant crop layer showed an improved accuracy (overall accuracy = 93.94%, Kappa coefficient = 0.92) than the other classifications without such a feature optimizing process. Our results indicate the potential of the ASTFS method for improving regional crop mapping.

AB Spring crops are a monoculture in Northern Kazakhstan. Mid-resolution satellite data of red and near infrared spectral bands from Terra's MODIS satellite can be used for assessment of regional landuse. The objective of this research was the analysis of weed infestation in spring grain crops. Weed infestation was classified into three categories, namely: minimum, average and maximum. The analysis of spectral characteristics of fields during the 2002 vegetative period permitted development of criteria to distinguish all three classes of weed infestation. It turned out, that the degree of weed population appeared to be closely linked with a number of uncultivated fallow fields. So the landuse classification map was used to define the fallow fields in each farm in the oblasts. The estimation of weed population and its influence on crop productivity was derived from these analyses. The study was conducted for about 10 million hectare of spring crops in five oblasts.

AB Irrigated area has been decreasing since last decade in Indonesia. Surface irrigation scheduling performed predominantly due to water limitation and plant heterogeneity. Plant type and growth phase relate to the performance of water delivery. The research objective is to compare land use classification (LUC) from Landsat 8 and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with supervised algorithm. Supervised method (i.e. minimum distance algorithm) was applied. The result showed six LUC from UAV, i.e.: vegetative stage of dry crop (39%), ripening stage of dry crop (23%), vegetative stage of paddy (15%), tillage (15%), bare land (7%), and paddy nursery (6%). On the other hand, five LUC were performed by Landsat 8 image, i.e.: vegetative stage of dry crop (10%), ripening stage of dry crop (17%), vegetative stage of paddy (5%), tillage area (62%), bare land (6%). UAV's image source performed more detail and accurate than satellite image. Thus, supervised method appropriate for UAV image for crop stage classification in small irrigation district.

AB Crop classification is a significant requirement to estimate crop area, structure, and spatial distribution, as well as provide important input parameters for crop yield models. Different techniques were considered in this system and providing betterment in automation. But none of them gave promising results. So here, a Convolutional Deep Neural Network (CDNN) is proposed to identify the crop areas with the help of Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images as well as the cultivation status of the crop. First, in training phase, the segmented image of the crop is preprocessed using HLS, then feature is extracted using BRIEF, then, they are classified using CDNN. Then after in testing phase, the input SAR image from the database is further processed using MRG algorithm and classified centered on the training results. After classification, the cultivation status of each classified crop can be identified by taking the Euclidean distance (ED) betwixt the standard parameters and resultant parameters of a specific crop. After computing ED, the ED is contrasted with the threshold value and the cultivation status of a particular crop can be identified. The results are analyzed to ascertain the performance shown by the proposed technique with other existent techniques.

AB The SBAM (Satellite Based Agricultural Monitoring) project, funded by the Italian Space Agency aims at: developing a validated satellite imagery based method for estimating and updating the agricultural areas in the region of Central-Africa; implementing an automated process chain capable of providing periodical agricultural land cover maps of the area of interest and, possibly, an estimate of the crop yield. The project aims at filling the gap existing in the availability of high spatial resolution maps of the agricultural areas of Kenya. A high spatial resolution land cover map of Central-Eastern Africa including Kenya was compiled in the year 2000 in the framework of the Africover project using Landsat images acquired, mostly, in 1995. We investigated the use of phenological information in supporting the use of remotely sensed images for crop classification and monitoring based on Landsat 8 and, in the near future, Sentinel 2 imagery. Phenological information on crop condition was collected using time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) based on Landsat 8 images. Kenyan countryside is mainly characterized by a high number of fragmented small and medium size farmlands that dramatically increase the difficulty in classification; 30 m spatial resolution images are not enough for a proper classification of such areas. So, a pan-sharpening FIHS (Fast Intensity Hue Saturation) technique was implemented to increase image resolution from 30 m to 15 m. Ground test sites were selected, searching for agricultural vegetated areas from which phenological information was extracted. Therefore, the classification of agricultural areas is based on crop phenology, vegetation index behaviour retrieved from a time series of satellite images and on AEZ (Agro Ecological Zones) information made available by FAO (FAO, 1996) for the area of interest. This paper presents the results of the proposed classification procedure in comparison with land cover maps produced in the past years by other projects. The results refer to the Nakuru County and they were validated using field campaigns data. It showed a satisfactory overall accuracy of 92.66 % which is a significant improvement with respect to previous land cover maps.

AB Managers and policy makers demand information on agriculture dynamics and distribution for the establishment of plans and strategies. For this purpose, the use of remote sensing data constitute an essential key to follow-up the agricultural systems dynamics. The aim of this study is to define a method based on fitted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), trend analysis tests and machine learning approaches for assessing and monitoring farming systems in a semi-arid region of Morocco. NDVI time series were smoothed using TIMESAT software for the period between 2000 and 2018. Then, three trend analysis tests were conducted which are: monotonic trend (Mann-Kendall), Man-Kendall significance and median trend (Theil-Sen). In addition, Random Forest (RF) classification methods were performed to classify the main agricultural cover type over the study area for the 2017/2018 cropping season. The results demonstrated the ability of fitted NDVI data and RF classification to identify the main agricultural systems, which are: 1) irrigated annual crop, 2) irrigated perennial crop, 3) rainfed areas and 4) fallow. Analysis of trend patterns based on fitted NDVI values shows high variability over the farming systems. Irrigated annual and perennial crops present high improvement of biomass activity with a small inter-variability with significant trend. For the Rainfed area and fallow, these classes show a non-significant trend with low degradation of productivity. In addition, these results can constitute a relevant means of control and spatio-temporal monitoring of farming systems. Overall, the results are relevant for managers and policy makers to develop procedures and actions in order to prevent environmental and agricultural events resulted from the spatio-temporal changes in farming systems.

AB Castile and Leon crops and natural land map is a highly detailed land cover layer, obtained through satellite imagery, which distinguishes between 122 land cover classes and includes 50 specific crop types. The project began in 2013 by using several satellites, with the production cost greatly reduced since 2016 when Sentinel-2 imagery became freely available, and is updated annually. The classification is performed using a machine learning algorithm trained with data retrieved from Integrated Administration and Control System and some other land use databases available in Spain. This map is also proposed as an advanced crop map, within SENSAGRI project (Sentinels Synergy for Agriculture) drafting in response of the EO Work programme "EO-3-2016: Evolution of Copernicus Services", as one of the four advanced proof-of-concept services. The algorithm will be validated in others European agricultural test areas which, along with Castile and Leon, are representative enough to show an overview of the European crop diversity.

AB The study of the spatial patterns and temporal changes of cropland is important to understand the underlying factors and the functional effects of the agricultural landscape. On the other hand, crop dynamics mapping is essential to know the overall agro-spatial diversity of the area. Therefore, this paper addressed a spatio-temporal analysis of cropland and cropping pattern change in the Bogra district of Bangladesh over the last 16 years (between 1988/89 and 2004/05). In this paper, crop mapping from multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images was described. Landsat TM and IRS P6 LISS III satellite images were used with GIS for spatial dynamics of cropland and cropping pattern change analysis. First, seasonal cropland maps were derived from object-based classification of satellite images, then two-date classified image differencing with GIS overlay technique and decision rules were applied. Cropping pattern change was analyzed in a spatial and quantitative way for the 16 years and for this, Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) and Land Change Modular (LCM) of IDRISI Andes were used. The results showed that in the area, mono crop cultivation was found in summer, but in winter, areas under different crop cultivation had changed dramatically. Change analysis showed that the changes mainly occurred in the north northwest and southwest of the areas, and during the time the highest change area was found under the rice-potato pattern.

AB Starting in 2009, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process of generating annual crop type digital maps using satellite imagery. Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat, Resourcesat-1, DMC, SPOT) and radar (Radarsat-2) imagery. Starting with the 2011 growing season, this activity was extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory. Since then, AAFC has consistently delivered an annual crop inventory that is close to the overall target accuracy of 85% at the national scale. However, from one province to another, and from one year to another, the classification accuracy is not uniform. It varies depending on satellite data availability and training site distribution. In an effort to improve mapping quality, the methodology is constantly evolving and new classifiers are under investigation.

AB Weeds are among the most harmful abiotic factors in agriculture, triggering significant yield loss worldwide. Remote sensing can detect and map the presence of weeds in various spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. This review aims to show the current and future trends of UAV applications in weed detection in the crop field. This study systematically searched the original articles published from 1 January 2016 to 18 June 2021 in the databases of Scopus, ScienceDirect, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) Direct, and Web of Science (WoS) using Boolean string: "weed " AND "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle " OR "UAV " OR "drone ". Out of the papers identified, 144 eligible studies did meet our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Most of the studies (i.e., 27.42%) on weed detection were carried out during the seedling stage of the growing cycle for the crop. Most of the weed images were captured using red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, i.e., 48.28% and main classification algorithm was machine learning techniques, i.e., 47.90%. This review initially highlighted articles from the literature that includes the crops' typical phenology stage, reference data, type of sensor/camera, classification methods, and current UAV applications in detecting and mapping weed for different types of crop. This study then provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor and algorithm and tries to identify research gaps by providing a brief outlook at the potential areas of research concerning the benefit of this technology in agricultural industries. Integrated weed management, coupled with UAV application improves weed monitoring in a more efficient and environmentally-friendly way. Overall, this review demonstrates the scientific information required to achieve sustainable weed management, so as to implement UAV platform in the real agricultural contexts.

AB As part of the "High-Resolution Earth Observation System", many major projects are being implemented. The first optical satellite (GF-1) in the high-resolution satellite series has completed in-orbit tests and entered the stage of data acquisition. GF-1 owns high resolution and information of wide field view sensor (WFV sensor) and the panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS sensor). In this study, GF-1 WFV sensor data with a resolution of 16 m, integrated with Landsat-8 and RapidEye data were selected to recognize maize in Xuchang using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method. The results showed that the precision of classification varies greatly among WFV sensors. In particular, WFV3 was of the highest accuracy to identify crops and planting area with accuracy higher than Landsat-8 and close to RapidEye. With regard to WFV1 and WFV4, the application effect was worse and less viable to identify species of complex autumn crops. In brief, the classification accuracy of SVM classifier is better than SAM classifier. It can be also concluded that SVM is more suitable for the identification of crops and planting area of extraction in the study area.

AB Land cover data gives the opportunity to study interactions between land cover status and environmental issues such as hydrologic processes, soil properties, or biodiversity. Land cover data often are based on classification of remote sensing data that seldom provides the requisite accuracy, spatial availability and temporal observational frequency for environmental studies. Thus, there is a high demand for accurate and spatio-temporal complete time series of land cover. In the past considerable research was undertaken to increase land cover classification accuracy, while less effort was spent on interpolation techniques. The purpose of this article is to present a space-time interpolation and revision approach for remotely sensed land cover data. The approach leverages special properties known for agricultural areas such as crop rotations or temporally static land cover classes. The newly developed IRSeL-tool (Interpolation and improvement of Remotely Sensed Land cover) corrects classification errors and interpolates missing land cover pixels. The easy-to-use tool solely requires an initial land cover data set. The IRSeL specific interpolation and revision technique, the data input requirements and data output structure are described in detail. A case study in an area around the city of Neumunster in Northern Germany from 2006 to 2012 was performed for IRSeL validation with initial land cover data sets (Landsat TM image classifications) for the years 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The results of the case study showed that IRSeL performs well; including years with no classification data overall accuracy values for IRSeL interpolated pixels range from 0.63 to 0.81. IRSeL application significantly increases the accuracy of the land cover data; overall accuracy values rise 0.08 in average resulting in overall accuracy values of at least 0.86. Considering estimated reliabilities, the IRSeL tool provides a temporally and spatially completed and revised land cover data set that allows drawing conclusions for land cover related studies.

AB Rice is an important agricultural crop in the Southwest Hilly Area, China, but there has been a lack of efficient and accurate monitoring methods in the region. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained considerable achievements in the remote sensing community. However, it has not been widely used in mapping a rice paddy, and most studies lack the comparison of classification effectiveness and efficiency between CNNs and other classic machine learning models and their transferability. This study aims to develop various machine learning classification models with remote sensing data for comparing the local accuracy of classifiers and evaluating the transferability of pretrained classifiers. Therefore, two types of experiments were designed: local classification experiments and model transferability experiments. These experiments were conducted using cloud-free Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data in Banan District and Zhongxian County, typical hilly areas of Southwestern China. A pure pixel extraction algorithm was designed based on land-use vector data and a Google Earth Online image. Four convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (one-dimensional (Conv-1D), two-dimensional (Conv-2D) and three-dimensional (Conv-3D_1 and Conv-3D_2) convolutional neural networks) were developed and compared with four widely used classifiers (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)). Recall, precision, overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score were applied to evaluate classification accuracy. The results showed that Conv-2D performed best in local classification experiments with OA of 93.14% and F1 score of 0.8552 in Banan District, OA of 92.53% and F1 score of 0.8399 in Zhongxian County. CNN-based models except Conv-1D provided more desirable performance than non-CNN classifiers. Besides, among the non-CNN classifiers, XGBoost received the best result with OA of 89.73% and F1 score of 0.7742 in Banan District, SVM received the best result with OA of 88.57% and F1 score of 0.7538 in Zhongxian County. In model transferability experiments, almost all CNN classifiers had low transferability. RF and XGBoost models have achieved acceptable F1 scores for transfer (RF = 0.6673 and 0.6469, XGBoost = 0.7171 and 0.6709, respectively).

AB [Objective] Based on the PIE SDK, Landsat-8 was used as the data source to realize the plug-in corn planting area extraction tool, which provided technical support for the rapid and objective acquisition of county corn planting area information, and assisted agricultural remote sensing application and agricultural development. [Methods] The PIE SDK was used for plug-in secondary development to realize the radiometric calibration, fusion and cropping functions of remote sensing images. The vegetation distribution of the experimental area was obtained by normalized vegetation index (NDVI), and the K-means classification method was used to realize Corn planting area extraction. [Results] Choosing Weishi County as experimental area, according to the Landsat-8/OLI data of September 4, 2014, the corn planting area was 29,800 hectares, accounting for 23.5% of the total area of the experimental area, mainly distributed in the central and eastern parts of the experimental area. (1) The corn planting area extracted by the development plug-in was 29,800 hectares. In 2014, the corn planting area in Weishi County was about 27,800 hectares. The total area error of the two compared with the experimental area was 2.25%. The high quality provides an effective tool for the survey of corn planting area in Weishi County. (2) The distribution map of corn plantation in Weishi County was obtained by processing the classification results, which is basically consistent with the distribution of corn planting in the county over the years. The method of extracting corn planting area in Weishi County by using NDVI and K-means method It is feasible, and the experimental results show that the maximum number of iterations is set to 30. This method can provide reference for the threshold setting of corn planting area information in the county. [Conclusions] Based on the PIE SDK for secondary development, to achieve the extraction of corn planting area in the county. The results basically meet the statistical data quality requirements, and also provide a reference for the plug-in development of similar crop extraction tools based on the PIE SDK, and can provide objective data to support fast and accurate information on the cultivation statistics, subsidies and insurance business as corn.

AB Paddy is the most famous crop in Indonesia, which dominantly planted primarily in the west and central part of Indonesia. Rice paddy field is the main food source for most of the Indonesian and Indonesian government are very considered about the stability of their food security program. Therefore, monitoring and evaluation of its sustainability and availability become a national priority. One of the solutions to agricultural monitoring and management program is mapping through remote sensing system. In the study, we used high-resolution multi-spectral imagery collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to map the paddy field and differentiate them based on their spectral characteristics. An Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method applied to the image for classifying the stage rice paddy field based on their spectral signature. The results of this study are: (i) a high-resolution map of paddy field and its classifications based on the period of planting, (ii) a comparison table showing the different spectral response for a different type of crops such as banana and tea. Hopefully, this study can support the government program on food security with valuable baseline information of the paddy field.

   Extraction
AB Over the past several decades, moderate-resolution remote sensing data have been used to obtain regional-scale land-cover information. Nowadays Change detection has been widely used in many applications. Change detection techniques may capture the changes of phenology information which are quite useful to distinguish a certain kind of crop from other land-cover types. In order to extract single late rice through phenology characteristic, a change detection model based on neighborhood correlation images (NCIs) and supervised classification was proposed. In this study, Landsat 8 OLI digital images acquired on July 19, 2013 and November 8, 2013 respectively were used to extract single late rice. Single late rice was chosen as the study object because of its unique phenology information changes, from steeping field to vegetation. The method proposed includes 5 parts: 1) Preprocessing data, 2) Creating NCI images, 3) Collecting training/test samples, 4) Extracting single late rice and 5) Classifying images and assessing accuracy. The overall accuracy of single late rice was 90.3%, indicating that the change detection method using NCIs is an effective way to extract crops with useful phenology information.

AB Crop type maps were created without the traditional need for in-season training data across the Corn Belt and Great Plains regions of the United States. This was accomplished through machine learning of historical land cover information, paired with a time-series of multi-spectral satellite imagery composites spanning the growing season, to develop rulesets, which were used for real-time prediction in the current year. Specifically, a decade's worth of annual 30 m resolution crop specific maps, known as the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), provided the foundation, and prior and current year's satellite imagery from Landsat 7 and 8 and Sentinel-2a and-2b built upon it. Four modeling scenarios, all using random forests, were performed to understand the crop mapping abilities of the datasets independently and combined. They were 1) use of CDLs only (i.e. prediction based solely on crop rotation history) 2) use of Landsat 7 and 8 bottom-of-atmosphere surface reflectance imagery only, 3) use of Sentinel-2a and-2b top-of-atmosphere imagery only, and 4) integration of the CDL, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 information together in a unified effort. Furthermore, the model runs were generated monthly, beginning in April, through the growing season to provide understanding of classification performance as a function of time. The 2020 crop year, relatively normal in terms of planting and weather, was used for the test. Accuracy statistics were generated by randomly sampling 50 counties and comparing those classification outputs to the actual 2020 CDL. Pixel-level results showed that prediction by midsummer using only the CDL information provided a crop type map with corn and soybean consumer and producer agreement above 70% and winter wheat just below 50%. The early season imagery-based classifications were markedly worse. However, as Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery accumulated through July, those classifications became significantly better than those reliant on the use of the CDL information only. Ultimately, the very best crop maps resulted from integrating the CDLs with a full season's worth of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. At that point in late September, the corn and soybean agreements were around 85% and winter wheat near 70%. All analysis was performed within Google Earth Engine cloud-based public imagery repository and high-performance computing system. The classification outputs provide practitioners with US crop type maps in near real-time.

AB The analysis of canopy spectral response mechanism of crop lodging stress is an important basis for remote sensing monitoring of large-scale crop lodging disasters. Lodging stress directly change the ratio of visual stem, leaf and panicle in remote sensing spectrum detection field of view. By analyzing the relationship between canopy spectra and the ratio of visual stem, leaf and panicle, this paper explores the change regulation of visual stem, leaf and panicle components and spectral response of rice canopy under different intensities of lodging stress, and provides theoretical support for remote sensing monitoring of large-scale crop lodging disaster. Taking the real lodging rice in Xinghua City and Dafeng District of Jiangsu Province in 2017 as the research object, with the support of field observation experiment , the rule of canopy spectral variation of lodging rice with different lodging intensities was analyzed, and the correlation between the ratio of canopy visual stem, leaf and panicle and lodging angle under different lodging intensity was analyzed, and parameters of sensitive agronomy that can effectively represent the lodging intensity was screened. A response model between rice canopy spectral indices and sensitive agronomic parameters was constructed by grey relational analysis to realize the spectrum diagnosis of rice lodging disaster, and field-measured samples were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. The results showed that with the increase of lodging strength, the canopy spectra showed regular changes, red-band and near-infrared band response was more obvious, "Red edge" position is obviously "blue shift", and "red edge" amplitude and "red edge" area increase, it shows that the red-band and near-infrared band on rice lodging stress intensity is more sensitive. The correlation of the canopy visual leaf-stalk ratio and lodging strength decreased with the increase of lodging strength, which was more than 0. 715, indicating that the visible leaf stem ratio of canopy was better in characterizing the lodging strength. Through correlation analysis between visual leaf-stem ratio and hyperspectral reflectance, 698 and 1 132 nm in the red and near-infrared bands were respectively selected as the sensitive bands, and then the characteristic vegetation index was calculated. The spectral response model of rice visual leaf-stem ratio based on characteristic vegetation index was constructed by using grey correlation analysis, and the determining factor for the test sample was 0. 635, and the precision of the classification of the disaster level with the visual leaf-stem ratio inversion result reached 82%. Therefore, the contribution proportion of stem, leaf and panicle in the canopy of rice in the field of spectral detectors was changed regularly after lodging. The difference of spectral reflectance and the ratio of apparent field in the Miho of stem, leaf and panicle is directly reflected in the spectral difference of lodging rice canopy. While visual leaf-stem ratio can effectively characterize the population structure change of rice under lodging stress, which has a good response relationship with the lodging intensity. The response law of visual leaf-stem ratio and rice canopy spectrum of different lodging intensity can effectively distinguish the lodging intensity, which will help provide a prior knowledge for remote sensing monitoring of rice lodging at the regional scale.

TI Crop reflectance estimate errors from the SAIL model due to spatial and

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SCATTERING
AB Radiative transfer models must be combined with crop growth model for the latter to be recalibrated on each point of a regional domain using remote sensing data. However, radiative transfer model have parameters depending on vegetation and soil characteristics which vary spatially and temporally at a regional scale, but are gene:ally unknown;. Their estimaition leads to reflectance simulation errors. These errors are analyzed in this article for the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum using the SAIL model for sugar beets. Two ways for estimating SAIL parameters were compared: One does not require any knowledge of magnitude and variability. The other one is based on rules developed from parameter distribution analysis and extra knowledge on soils and climate. The reflectance estimation error was very high for LAI<2.0 when no previous knowledge was assumed. Defining parameter values from soil, climate, and crop development knowledge considerably reduced errors and would be useful for application of reflectance models at the regional scale. The use of vegetation indices reduced the effects of parameter value uncertainty, but still benefited from improved parameter estimation. It was found that simple classification of crop and notably soil parameter values would be useful for application of reflectance models at the regional scale. Future work will deal with quantifying consequences when reflectance models are coupled to crop growth models for regional yield estimation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB The purpose of this study is to present comparative performance analysis of different machine learning algorithms for large area crop classification. Ten Indian districts with significant rabi crops viz. wheat, mustard, gram, red lentils (masoor) have been selected for the study. Most popular classical ensemble models - bagging/ARCing, random forest (RF), gradient boosting and Importance Sampled Learning Ensemble (ISLE) with traditional single model (decision tree) have been selected for comparative analysis. To incorporate dependency of large area crop in different variables viz. parent material and soil, phenology, texture, topography, soil moisture, vegetation, climate etc., 35 digital layers are prepared using different satellite data (ALOS DEM, Landsat-8, MODIS NDVI, RISAT-1, Sentinental-1A) and climatic data (precipitation, temperature). In rabi season, field survey about crop type is carried out to prepare training data. Performance is evaluated on the basis of marginal rates, F-measure and Jaccard's coefficient of community, Classification Success Index and Agreement Coefficients. Score is calculated to rank the algorithm. RF is best performer followed by gradient boosting for crop classification. Other ensemble methods ARCing, bagging and ISLE are in decreasing order of performance. Traditional non-ensemble method decision tree scored higher than ISLE.

ID RESOLUTION
AB Remote sensing offers the opportunity to produce land cover classifications for large and remote areas on a yearly basis and is an important tool in regions that lake these information. However, often training and validation data to generate annual land cover maps are not available in necessary quantity - being from one year only or covering only a small extent of the region of interest. This study was focused on land use classifications at regional scale with a special emphasize on annual updates under the constraint of limited sampling data. Often, sampling is reduced to one year or to an unrepresentative area extend within the region of interest. The investigations for the period between 2004 and 2009 were conducted in the irrigation systems of the Amu Darya Delta in Central Asia, where reliable information on crop rotations is required for sustainable land and water management.
   Annual training and validation data were extracted from high resolution land use classifications. For classification, statistical features based on MODIS time series of vegetation indices, reflectance and land surface temperature (LST) were calculated and a random forest algorithm was applied. By a combination of training data from different years, the accuracy could be enhanced from an overall accuracy of 70% to more than 90% for a focused subregion and also good consistency with high resolution images for the other parts of the data, which has to be confirmed using quantitative validation. A combination of a different number of years was tested. Already two years can be sufficient to generated a robust and transferable random forest to produce yearly land use maps.
   The study shows the possibility to combine training data from different years for the annual classification of irrigated croplands on a regional scale.

AB Intensive cultivation and long-term cropping are very important factors affect qualities and capability of soils for yield production. The current study aimed at using remote sensing and GIS for assessing the impact of intensive and long-term cropping on the capability of the soils and land degradation in Kafr Alshaikh Governorate soils for 55 years. The study used a previous data for the soils on the date 1961 and 2002 as well as collect a new data in 2016 for the same mapping units. All data were subjected to a land capability classification model, according to FAO system. The data revealed that the change with time for the soil qualities and capability were as follows: the majority of the soils in 1961 (86.95%) were classified as C3 compared to 22.45% in 2016 while, in 2002 was the worst since almost all soils classified as C5. Nevertheless, year 2016 witnesses a great change in the capability most soils change to the C4 (77.55%) compared with the 2002 (0.31%). The most limiting factors for crop production were, soil depth, salinity, and alkalinity where the intensive use of soils with Rice cultivation under the use of heavy machinery increase the chance to raise the ground water tale depth as well as the chance to increase the soil salinity. The study endorsed to follow crop rotation in addition to follow management program by adding organic matter and deep plowing to relief the effect of intensive cultivation.

AB Rice Agriculture, mainly cultivated in South Asia regions, is being monitored for extracting crop parameter, crop area, crop growth profile, crop yield using both optical and microwave remote sensing. Hyperspectral data provide more detailed information of rice agriculture. The present study was carried out at the experimental station of the Regional Rainfed Low land Rice Research Station, Assam, India (26.1400 degrees N, 91.7700 degrees E) and the overall climate of the study area comes under Lower Brahmaputra Valley (LBV) Agro Climatic Zones. The hyperspectral measurements were made in the year 2009 from 72 plots that include eight rice varieties along with three different level of nitrogen treatments (50, 100, 150 kg/ha) covering rice transplanting to the crop harvesting period. With an emphasis to varieties, hyperspectral measurements were taken in the year 2014 from 24 plots having 24 rice genotypes with different crop developmental ages. All the measurements were performed using a spectroradiometer with a spectral range of 350- 1050 nm under direct sunlight of a cloud free sky and stable condition of the atmosphere covering more than 95% canopy. In this study, reflectance collected from canopy of rice were expressed in terms of waveforms. Furthermore, generated waveforms were analysed for all combinations of nitrogen applications and varieties. A hierarchical clustering technique was employed to classify these waveforms into different groups. By help of agglomerative clustering algorithm a few number of clusters were finalized for different rice varieties along with nitrogen treatments. By this clustering approach, observational error in spectroradiometer reflectance was also nullified. From this hierarchical clustering, appropriate spectral signature for rice canopy were identified and will help to create rice crop classification accurately and therefore have a prospect to make improved information on rice agriculture at both local and regional scales. From this hierarchical clustering, spectral signature library for rice canopy were identified which will help to create rice crop classification maps and critical wave bands like green (519,559 nm), red (649 nm), red edge (729 nm) and NIR region (779,819 nm) were marked sensitive to nitrogen which will further help in nitrogen mapping of paddy agriculture over therefore have the prospect to make improved informed decisions.

AB Native grasslands play an important role in ecosystem function, biodiversity, climate change, and economics, yet quantifiable estimates of the rate and location of native grassland change in western Canada are not readily available. To date, optical remote sensing has been explored for grassland mapping, but cloud cover limits the availability of timely data for the discrimination of improved, as opposed to native, grassland. In this study we investigated the utility of RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery to map native grassland, improved grassland, and agricultural crops. Fine quad-polarisation mode RADARSAT-2 data were acquired at two incidence angles over a test site in southern Alberta every 24 days from 1 April to 31 October 2009 and were processed using the Freeman-Durden decomposition. Double-bounce, volumetric, and surface scattering properties suggest that native grasslands can be distinguished from cultivated cropping, especially using a mid-to late-season image. However, discriminating native grasslands from improved grasslands was more difficult. Land cover classification of a single RADARSAT-2 image from July 2009 provided reasonable but slightly less accurate results compared with a single Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image (Kappa value of 0.65 compared with 0.81).

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
AB The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for providing green percent crop cover information over agricultural canopies for use in precision farming. Ground measurements and airborne hyperspectral Probe-1 data were acquired over two agricultural sites in July 1999 near Clinton, Ontario, Canada, and in July 2000 near Indian Head, Saskatchewan, Canada. A manual endmember selection and extraction approach was used to unmix the reflectance cubes. Linear constrained and weakly constrained unmixing was conducted to determine crop endmember fractions. Results indicate that the two spectral unmixing algorithms were equally successful. If prior knowledge of the fields exists, a manual endmember selection technique is a suitable approach for the selection of endmembers in an image scene. Correlations between ground data and Probe-1 crop fractions showed very good results ( root mean square error (RMSE) of +/- 11.06% and +/- 11.20% and index of agreement ( D) of 0.91 and 0.90 for constrained and weakly constrained unmixing, respectively) when the endmembers were adjusted for their impurity. This highlighted the importance of finding pure or the "purest" pixels for each endmember in the image scene. The use of spectral unmixing to quantify within-crop and within-field percent crop cover showed mixed success. Canola and wheat crops ( RMSE of +/- 10.67% and +/- 11.77%; D of 0.94 and 0.85) revealed better correlations than the bean and corn crops ( RMSE of +/- 10.83% and +/- 12.46%; D of 0.64 and 0.59). The somewhat poor results for pea crops ( RMSE of +/- 9.70%; D of 0.58) are possibly due to the ground vertical photograph classification process where it was difficult to distinguish pea stems and residue components.

AB Predicting crop yields and their spatio-temporal variability under a changing climate is a challenging but essential undertaking for crop management and policymaking purposes. The availability of information on risks associated with effects of climatic variability on agricultural activity outcomes is critical for stakeholders ranging from individual landowners to national economists alike. This research was conducted as a pilot study to (1) develop satellite remote sensing based estimates of maize acreage in a typical Maize growing region in Pakistan, (2) to develop a statistical-empirical model for prediction of maize yields, and finally, (3) to assess the influence of temperature on inter-annual variability in maize yields across a decade. A total of eight machine learning algorithms were tested for identifying maize growing operations in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan using Landsat 8 imagery. Classification models were evaluated via 200 randomly selected ground-verified points across the study region. Results of the maize mapping exercise were used to estimate interannual maize yields using Landsat-derived multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data as predictors. Predictors for the yield forecasting model were selected via principal component screening and were fed into a least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) regression model. The yield model thus developed was applied to 10 years of past data (2006-2017) and validated against data recorded by government sources. Finally, predictions spanning the ten years were tested for effects of temperature variability to find evidence of influence of ambient temperature on maize yields. Results indicate that support vector machine classifiers work the best in this landscape (accuracies 90%) and reveal that maize cropping area may be underestimated in government sources by as much as 14%. The LASSO regression models also showed very good fits (validation R-2 = 0.95) and were fairly accurate in tracking interannual variations in maize yields (R-2 = 0.78.) Results also indicate that the maximum temperature has significant negative influence (R-2 = 0.76, P < 0.0001) on maize yields in Faisalabad district. Methods presented in this study should be of use to policymakers for better formulating export-import policies and decisions governing food security issues in the larger region.

AB Crop rotation is one of the important decisions made independently by numerous farm managers, and is a critical variable in models of crop growth and soil carbon. In Iowa and much of the Midwestern United States (US), the typical management decision is to rotate corn and soybean crops for a single field; therefore, the land-cover changes each year even though the total area of agricultural land-use remains the same. The price for corn increased from 2001 to 2010, which increased corn production in Iowa. We tested the hypothesis that the production increase was the result of changes in crop rotation in Iowa using the annual remote sensing classification (the cropland data layer) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service. It was found that the area planted in corn increased from 4.7 million hectares in 2001 to 5.7 million hectares in 2007, which was correlated with the market price for corn. At the county level, there were differences in how the increase in corn production was accomplished. Northern and central counties had little land to expand cultivation and generally increased corn production by converting to a corn-corn rotation from the standard corn-soybean rotation. Southern counties in Iowa increased corn production by expanding into land that was not under recent cultivation. These changes affect the amount of soil carbon sequestration.

AB The Willamette Valley, bounded to the west by the Coast Range and to the east by the Cascade Mountains, is the largest river valley completely confined to Oregon. The fertile valley soils combined with a temperate, marine climate create ideal agronomic conditions for seed production. Historically, seed cropping systems in the Willamette Valley have focused on the production of grass and forage seeds. In addition to growing over two-thirds of the nation's cool-season grass seed, cropping systems in the Willamette Valley include a diverse rotation of over 250 commodities for forage, seed, food, and cover cropping applications. Tracking the sequence of crop rotations that are grown in the Willamette Valley is paramount to answering a broad spectrum of agronomic, environmental, and economical questions. Landsat imagery covering approximately 25,303 km(2) were used to identify agricultural crops in production from 2004 to 2017. The agricultural crops were distinguished by classifying images primarily acquired by three platforms: Landsat 5 (2003-2013), Landsat 7 (2003-2017), and Landsat 8 (2013-2017). Before conducting maximum likelihood remote sensing classification, the images acquired by the Landsat 7 were pre-processed to reduce the impact of the scan line corrector failure. The corrected images were subsequently used to classify 35 different land-use classes and 137 unique two-year-long sequences of 57 classes of non-urban and non-forested land-use categories from 2004 through 2014. Our final data product uses new and previously published results to classify the western Oregon landscape into 61 different land use classes, including four majority-rule-over-time super-classes and 57 regular classes of annually disturbed agricultural crops (19 classes), perennial crops (20 classes), forests (13 classes), and urban developments (5 classes). These publicly available data can be used to inform and support environmental and agricultural land-use studies.

AB Brazil is an important sugar cane producer, which is the main resource for ethanol production, a renewable source of energy. This agricultural commodity is important to the country economy, becoming fundamental to improve models that assist the crops monitoring process. Vegetation indexes originated from remote sensing images and agrometeorological indexes can be combined to represent sugar cane fields in a regional scale. However, finding different regions with similar patterns to classify or analyze their characteristics is a non-trivial task. Accordingly, this paper presents a method to find similar sugar cane fields represented by series of vegetation and agrometeorological indexes. The proposed method combines a weighted distance function with an algorithm to find similar objects. Results were coincident in the most cases with the classification done by experts, finding regions with similar characteristics of climate and productivity. Consequently, this approach can help in decision making processes by agricultural entrepreneurs.

AB The availability of crop type reference datasets for satellite image classification is very limited for complex agricultural systems as observed in developing and emerging countries. Indeed, agricultural land use is very dynamic, agricultural censuses are often poorly georeferenced and crop types are difficult to interpret directly from satellite imagery. In this paper, we present a database made of 24 datasets collected in a standardized manner over nine sites within the framework of the international JECAM (Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring) initiative; the sites were spread over seven countries of the tropical belt, and the number of data collection years depended on the site (from 1 to 7 years between 2013 and 2020). These quality-controlled datasets are distinguished by in situ data collected at the field scale by local experts, with precise geographic coordinates, and following a common protocol. Altogether, the datasets completed 27 074 polygons (20 257 crops and 6817 noncrops, ranging from 748 plots in 2013 (one site visited) to 5515 in 2015 (six sites visited)) documented by detailed keywords. These datasets can be used to produce and validate agricultural land use maps in the tropics. They can also be used to assess the performances and robustness of classification methods of cropland and crop types/practices in a large range of tropical farming systems. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.18167/DVN1/P7OLAP (Jolivot et al., 2021).

AB Rice farming is one of the most important activities in the agriculture sector, producing staple food for the majority of the world's growing population. Accurate and up-to-date assessment of the spatial distribution of rice cultivated area is a key information requirement of all stakeholders including policy makers, rice farmers and consumers. Timely assessment with high precision is, e.g., crucial for water resource management, market prices control and during humanitarian food crisis. Recently, two Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites carrying a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor were launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the homework of the Copernicus program. The advanced data acquisition capabilities of S-1 provide a unique opportunity to monitor different land cover types at high spatial (20 m) and temporal (twice-weekly to biweekly) resolution. The objective of this research is to evaluate the applicability of an existing phenology-based classification method for continental-scale rice cropland mapping using S-1 backscatter time series. In this study, the S-1 images were collected during the rice growing season of 2015 covering eight selected European test sites situated in six Mediterranean countries. Due to the better rice classification capabilities of SAR cross-polarized measurement as compared to co-polarized data, S-1 cross-polarized (VH) data were used. Phenological parameters derived from the S-1 VH backscatter time series were used as an input to a knowledge-based decision-rule classifier in order to classify the input data into rice and non-rice areas. The classification results were evaluated using multiple regions of interest (ROIs) drawn from high-resolution optical remote sensing (SPOT 5) data and the European CORINE land cover (CLC 2012) product. An overall accuracy of more than 70% for all eight study sites was achieved. The S-1 based classification maps reveal much more details compared to the rice field class contained in the CLC 2012 product. These findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of using S-1 VH data to develop an operational rice crop monitoring framework at the continental scale.

AB Rice mapping with remote sensing imagery provides an alternative means for estimating crop-yield and performing land management due to the large geographical coverage and low cost of remotely sensed data. Rice mapping in Southern China, however, is very difficult as rice paddies are patchy and fragmented, reflecting the undulating and varied topography. In addition, abandoned lands widely exist in Southern China due to rapid urbanization. Abandoned lands are easily confused with paddy fields, thereby degrading the classification accuracy of rice paddies in such complex landscape regions. To address this problem, the present study proposes an innovative method for rice mapping through combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a decision tree (DT) method with phenological metrics. First, a pre-trained LeNet-5 Model using the UC Merced Dataset was developed to classify the cropland class from other land cover types, i.e. built-up, rivers, forests. Then, paddy rice field was separated from abandoned land in the cropland class using a DT model with phenological metrics derived from the time-series data of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The accuracy of the proposed classification methods was compared with three other classification techniques, namely, back propagation neural network (BPNN), original CNN, pre-trained CNN applied to HJ-1 A/B charge-coupled device (CCD) images of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Results suggest that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 93.56%, much higher than those of other methods. This indicates that the proposed method can efficiently accommodate the challenges of rice mapping in regions with complex landscapes.

AB Agricultural greenhouse (AG), one of the fastest-growing technology-based approaches worldwide in terms of controlling the environmental conditions of crops, plays an essential role in food production, resource conservation and the rural economy, but has also caused environmental and socio-economic problems due to policy promotion and market demand. Therefore, long-term monitoring of AG is of utmost importance for the sustainable management of protected agriculture, and previous efforts have verified the effectiveness of remote sensing-based techniques for mono-temporal AG mapping in a relatively small area. However, currently, a continuous annual AG remote sensing-based dataset at large-scale is generally unavailable. In this study, an annual AG mapping method oriented to the provincial area and long-term period was developed to produce the first Landsat-derived annual AG dataset in Shandong province, China from 1989 to 2018 on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The mapping window for each year was selected based on the vegetation growth and the phenological information, which was critical in distinguishing AG from other misclassified categories. Classification for each year was carried out initially based on the random forest classifier after the feature optimization. A temporal consistency correction algorithm based on classification probability was then proposed to the classified AG maps for further improvement. Finally, the average User's Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy and F1-score of AG based on visually-interpreted samples over 30 years reached 96.56%, 86.64% and 0.911, respectively. Furthermore, we also found that the ranked features via calculating the importance of each tested feature resulted in the highest accuracy and the strongest stability in the initial classification stage, and the proposed temporal consistency correction algorithm improved the final products by approximately five percent on average. In general, the resultant AG sequence dataset from our study has revealed the expansion of this typical object of "Human-Nature" interaction in agriculture and has a potential application in use of greenhouse-related technology and the scientific planning of protected agriculture.

AB In this paper, an agricultural land cover classification algorithm is presented that uses L-band SAR observations over time to create a crop/non-crop classification. A statistical measurement known as the coefficient of variation (CV) is introduced, which as a measurement of change is able to differentiate between changing agricultural fields and relatively static non-crop areas. Images from the airborne AgriSAR 2006 campaign in northern Germany and from the ALOS PALSAR satellite over Minnesota, USA are used to demonstrate the algorithm. The small region covered by the AgriSAR campaign is used to highlight the differences in behavior of L- and C-band, and in this case the better results of L-band data when using the CV algorithm. Results in both regions show promise for future use of the CV algorithm.

AB Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Rice usually grows in tropical and subtropical areas where are usually rainy and cloudy. Under this weather condition, optical remote sensing has a great limitation, but the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) runs well. This paper utilized C band multi-temporal Radarsat-2 data, which is acquired in 2016, to extract quad-polarized backscattering coefficients, Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters for establishing classification features. Random forest (RF) algorithm was employed as the classifier. The Overall Accuracy (OA) is 82.9% when only the data on May 15th was used. After adding the data on July 26th, the OA increased to 88.8%. Then, the variable importance was estimated by using out-of-bag (OOB) data. The results indicate that using RF would effectively identify the ground objects in the rice planting area.

AB The exploitation of the unprecedented capacity of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data offers new opportunities for crop mapping. In the framework of the SenSAgri project, this work studies the synergy of very high-resolution Sentinel time series to produce accurate early seasonal binary cropland mask and crop type map products. A crop classification processing chain is proposed to address the following: (1) high dimensionality challenges arising from the explosive growth in available satellite observations and (2) the scarcity of training data. The two-fold methodology is based on an S1-S2 classification system combining the so-called soft output predictions of two individually trained classifiers. The performances of the SenSAgri processing chain were assessed over three European test sites characterized by different agricultural systems. A large number of highly diverse and independent data sets were used for validation experiments. The agreement between independent classification algorithms of the Sentinel data was confirmed through different experiments. The presented results assess the interest of decision-level fusion strategies, such as the product of experts. Accurate crop map products were obtained over different countries in the early season with limited training data. The results highlight the benefit of fusion for early crop mapping and the interest of detecting cropland areas before the identification of crop types.

AB High resolution descriptions of plant distribution have utility for many ecological applications but are especially useful for predictive modeling of gene flow from transgenic crops. Difficulty lies in the extrapolation errors that occur when limited ground survey data are scaled up to the landscape or national level. This problem is epitomized by the wide confidence limits generated in a previous attempt to describe the national abundance of riverside Brassica rapa (a wild relative of cultivated rapeseed) across the United Kingdom. Here, we assess the value of airborne remote sensing to locate B. rapa over large areas and so reduce the need for extrapolation. We describe results from flights over the river Nene in England acquired using Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) imagery, together with ground truth data. It proved possible to detect 97% of flowering B. rapa on the basis of spectral profiles. This included all stands of plants that occupied >2m square (>5 plants), which were detected using single-pixel classification. It also included very small populations (<5 flowering plants, 1-2m square) that generated mixed pixels, which were detected using spectral unmixing. The high detection accuracy for flowering B. rapa was coupled with a rather large false positive rate (43%). The latter could be reduced by using the image detections to target fieldwork to confirm species identity, or by acquiring additional remote sensing data such as laser altimetry or multitemporal imagery.

AB The Kyoto Protocol entering into force on 16 February 2005 continues to spur interest in development of carbon trading mechanisms internationally and domestically. Critical to the development of a carbon trading effort is verification that carbon has been sequestered, and field level measurement of C change is likely cost prohibitive. Estimating C change based on agricultural management practices related to carbon sequestration seems more realistic, and analysis of satellite imagery could be used to monitor and verify these practices over large areas. We examined using Landsat imagery to verify crop rotations and quantify crop residue biomass in north central Montana. Field data were collected using a survey of farms. Standard classification tree analysis (CTA) and boosted classification and regression tree analysis (BCTA) were used to classify crop types. Linear regression (LM), regression tree analysis (RTA), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) were used to estimate crop residue. Six crop types were classified with 97% accuracy (BCTA) with class accuracies of 88-99%. Paired t-tests were used to compare the difference between known and predicted mean crop residue biomass. The difference between known and predicted mean residues using SGB was not different than 0 (p-value = 0.99); however root mean square error (RMSE) was large (1981 kg ha(-1)), implying that SGB accurately predicted regional crop residue biomass but not local predictions (i.e., field or farm level). The results of this study, and previous research classifying tillage practices and estimating soil disturbance, supports using satellite imagery as an effective tool for monitoring and verifying agricultural management practices related to carbon sequestration over large areas.

AB There is an increasing demand for clove products, mainly dried buds and essential oil on global markets. Consequently, the importance of clove trees as a provisioning service is increasing at the local level, particularly for smallholders cultivating clove trees as cash crops. Due to limited availability of data on local production, using remote sensing-based methods to quantify today's clove production is of key interest. We estimated the clove bud yield in a study site in northeastern Madagascar by detecting individual clove trees and determining relevant productio n systems, including pasture and clove, clove plantation and agroforestry systems. We implemented an individual tree detection method based on two machine learning approaches. Specifically, we proposed using a circular Hough transform (CHT) for the automated detection of individual clove trees. Subsequently, we implemented a tree species classification method using a random forests (RF) classifier based on a set of features extracted for relevant trees in the above production systems. Finally, we classified and mapped different production systems. Based on the number of detected clove trees growing in a clove production system, we estimated the production system-dependent clove bud yield. Our results show that 97.9% of all reference clove trees were detected using a CHT. Classifying clove and non-clove trees resulted in a producer accuracy of 70.7% and a user accuracy of 59.2% for clove trees. The classification of the clove production systems resulted in an overall accuracy of 77.9%. By averaging different clove tree yield estimates obtained from the literature, we estimated an average total yield of approximately 575 tons/year for our 25,600 ha study area. With this approach, we demonstrate a first step towards large-scale clove bud yield estimation using remote sensing data and methodologies.

AB The US Department of Agriculture (USDA)/National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has generated the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) product for more than twelve years, providing annual geospatial updates of the agricultural landscape across the US Heartland. The CDL program delivers acreage estimates based on regression modeling for decision support and provides a crop-specific geospatial dataset for the public domain. This model produces acreage estimates for statisticians and key decision makers in NASS Field Offices and the Agricultural Statistics Board, the official statistical reporting unit of USDA. The CDL program has grown incrementally as collaborative partnerships and technological efficiencies have increased via re-engineering both the classification and estimation process. The CDL is now operational in 19 states for 2008 covering the major corn, soybeans, cotton, and wheat areas. Additionally, the CDL is generated multiple times during the growing season. This allows the program to take advantage of updated satellite imagery and updated farmer reported ground data, in consideration for the crop reports that NASS releases in June, August, September, and October.
   Satellite data have been used successfully for years by the CDL program to accurately identify crop types and produce acreage estimates at the state, district, and county levels. Continued expansion of the CDL program would be impossible without leveraging both satellite and ground truth data partnerships. The USDA/Foreign Agricultural Service/Satellite Image Archive (SIA) provides year round coverage of all major growing areas, while the USDA/Farm Services Agency (FSA) provides farmer reported agricultural specific ground truth. These data sharing partnerships are synergized by the CDL to provide a crop specific land cover classification utilizing regression tree software derived from two major inputs; 1) 56 meter multispectral imagery from Resourcesat-1 AWiFS and 2) ground truth training data from the FSA, Common Land Unit Program. Additionally, 3) ancillary datasets are incorporated into the classification method to improve non-agricultural land cover, including; The National Elevation Dataset; the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), the NLCD Imperviousness and Forest Canopy products. The current CDL product is a comprehensive land cover inventory produced operationally in-season annually.

AB Watermarking represents a potentially effective tool for the protection and verification of ownership rights in remotely sensed imagery. This latter requires however that the image quality degradation due to watermark embedding should be very limited. In this paper, we propose to adapt the spread spectrum method described in ill to render the watermark insertion process near lossless while keeping most of its effective robustness capability. This is carried out by inserting the watermark ill the middle-frequency range of the DCT domain instead of the low-frequency range as done in [1]. The exact position of the insertion is determined by means of it numerical root-finding, method to meet it user-specified minimum level of robustness against it given ensemble of attacks. Experimental results obtained on a multispectral remote sensing image show that the proposed method allows to trade it contained loss of robustness with it significant gain of image quality quantified in terms of both PSNR and impact on classification accuracy. In addition, they reveal an interesting property of the watermark insertion shifting into the middle-frequency range that consists in a sharp increase of the robustness to the widely used cropping operation.

AB Soil salinization caused by natural and anthropogenic factors is an important environmental hazard especially in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Accumulation of salts in the soil is a major threat to crop production and global agriculture; therefore, rapid and precise detection of salt-affected lands is highly critical for preserving soil sustainability and supporting food production. Advancement in remote sensing techniques and machine-learning algorithms has started to contribute to fast and large-scale monitoring and mapping of soil salinization throughout the world. This paper aims to analyze the performance of three different machine-learning algorithms to map soil salinity using Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2A satellite images, and ground-based electrical conductivity (EC) measurements with the aid of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) methods are implemented to create a correlation between ground measurements and satellite-derived environmental variables or spectral indices. After selecting the optimum five variables including wetness band, three soil salinity indices, and one vegetation index, soil salinity maps are generated in three machine-learning algorithms. The output soil salinity map in RF algorithm demonstrated the most reliable spatial distribution of various soil salinity classes in the selected study area. Despite CART provided slightly better prediction of soil salinity with R-squared (R-2) of 0.98 for Sentinel-2A data, and 0.96 for Landsat-8 OLI data in comparison with accuracy results of RF technique with R-2 of 0.96 for Sentinel-2A data and 0.94 for Landsat-8 OLI data, the output map of RF model estimated more reliable salinity levels in salt crusts, agricultural lands, drainage areas, and swamps. The corresponding result highly matched with visual interpretation. Soil salinity maps derived from SVR algorithms by using various combinations of input variables displayed relatively poor estimation of soil EC values compared to the other two methods.

AB Karamoja is notoriously food insecure and has been in need of food aid for most years during the last two decades. One of the main factors causing food insecurity is drought. Reliable, area-wide, long-term data for detecting and monitoring drought conditions are critical for timely, life-saving interventions and the long-term development of the region, yet such data are sparse or unavailable. Due to advances in satellite remote sensing, characterizing drought in data-sparse regions like Karamoja has become possible. This study characterizes agricultural drought in Karamoja to enable a comprehensive understanding of drought, concomitantly evaluating the suitability of NDVI-based drought monitoring. We found that in comparison with the existing data, NDVI data currently provide the best, consistent, and spatially explicit information for operational drought monitoring in Karamoja. Results indicate that the most extreme agricultural drought in recent years occurred in 2009 followed by 2004 and 2002 and suggest that in Karamoja, moderate to severe droughts (e.g., 2008) often have the same impact on crops and human needs (e.g., food aid) as extreme droughts (e.g., 2009). We present in a proof-of-concept frame, a method to estimate the number of people needing food assistance and the population likely to fall under the integrated food security phase classification (IPC) Phase 3 (crisis) due to drought severity. Our model indicates that 90.7% of the variation in the number of people needing aid can be explained by NDVI data and NDVI data can augment these estimates. We conclude that the biggest drivers of food insecurity are the cultivation of crops on marginal land with insignificant inputs, the lack of irrigation and previous systematic incapacitation of livestock (pastoral) alternatives through government programming. Further research is needed to bridge empirical results with social-economic studies on drought impacts on communities in the region to better understand additional factors that will need to be addressed to ensure livelihood resilience.

AB The disease of banana Fusarium wilt currently threatens banana production areas all over the world. Rapid and large-area monitoring of Fusarium wilt disease is very important for the disease treatment and crop planting adjustments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of supervised classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to identify locations that were infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a five-band multi-spectral sensor (blue, green, red, red-edge and near-infrared bands) was used to capture the multi-spectral imagery. A total of 139 ground sample-sites were surveyed to assess the occurrence of banana Fusarium wilt. The results showed that the SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms exhibited good performance for identifying and mapping banana Fusarium wilt disease in UAV-based multi-spectral imagery. The overall accuracies of the SVM, RF, and ANN were 91.4%, 90.0%, and 91.1%, respectively for the pixel-based approach. The RF algorithm required significantly less training time than the SVM and ANN algorithms. The maps generated by the SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms showed the areas of occurrence of Fusarium wilt disease were in the range of 5.21-5.75 hm(2), accounting for 36.3%-40.1% of the total planting area of bananas in the study area. The results also showed that the inclusion of the red-edge band resulted in an increase in the overall accuracy of 2.9%-3.0%. A simulation of the resolutions of satellite-based imagery (i.e., 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m, and 5 m resolutions) showed that imagery with a spatial resolution higher than 2 m resulted in good identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt. The results of this study demonstrate that the RF classifier is well suited for the identification and mapping of banana Fusarium wilt disease from UAV-based remote sensing imagery. The results provide guidance for disease treatment and crop planting adjustments.

AB Cloud cover remains a significant limitation to a broad range of applications relying on optical remote sensing imagery, including crop identification/yield prediction, climate monitoring, and land cover classification. A common approach to cloud removal treats the problem as an inpainting task and imputes optical data in the cloud-affected regions employing either mosaicing historical data or making use of sensing modalities not impacted by cloud obstructions, such as SAR. Recently, deep learning approaches have been explored in these applications; however, the majority of reported solutions rely on external learning practices, i.e., models trained on fixed datasets. Although these models perform well within the context of a particular dataset, a significant risk of spatial and temporal overfitting exists when applied in different locations or at different times. Here, cloud removal was implemented within an internal learning regime through an inpainting technique based on the deep image prior. The approach was evaluated on both a synthetic dataset with an exact ground truth, as well as real samples. The ability to inpaint the cloud-affected regions for varying weather conditions across a whole year with no prior training was demonstrated, and the performance of the approach was characterised.

AB Earth observation systems are providing a growing amount of high resolution and multi-spectral data including agricultural crop yield predictions, local weather forecasts, wild fire tracking, and water quality monitoring. With the advent of multiple elements and sophisticated processing and modeling, there are also increasing avenues for introduction of errors. It is important to quantify and characterize these errors in the remotely sensed data as it gets increasingly used to inform vital decisions. Here, a data value-chain approach is presented for conceptualizing introduction and propagation of errors in remote sensing data acquisition, processing, and decisions. A detailed case of calibration errors and their propagation to higher level data products is then discussed. An NDVI analysis is used as an example, and it is shown (for the selected region), that a 3% error in reflectance ratio of red and NIR bands translates into a difference of 60 % for category 5 NDVI classification (representing high vegetation). This amplification of errors along the data value chain is caused by nonlinear operators such as the application of quotients to differences of reflectance values as well as the use of classifiers based on fixed color thresholding.

TI New land-cover maps of Ghana for 2015 using Landsat 8 and three popular

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

AB Remote-sensing products provide opportunities to monitor complex phenomena on the Earth from space for good decision-making. An example is land-cover maps, which are useful for monitoring both human-and naturally induced environmental changes to enhance environmental management for the benefit of the society. Yet there are numerous critical areas of the world such as biodiversity hotspots where the inaccessibility of quality satellite images has hindered progress in our understanding and management of the natural environment. The West African biodiversity hotspot is one such area where persistent thick clouds in freely available satellite images has been a great discouragement to the production of local land-cover maps to monitor the ongoing deforestation and rapid environmental change. Ghana is a country in West Africa where no land-cover map (except global ones) has been published for over a decade although large tracts of land have been converted from their natural states to agricultural land. In this article, we present 30 m land-cover maps of the country using Landsat 8 images and three popular classifiers Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and random forest (RF) - for the year 2015. We produced these maps for use in our future biodiversity assessment in the region. An overall accuracy (OA) of 85.5% (kappa = 0.77) was achieved for MLC, with similar but slightly lower accuracies for RF and SVM, which indicates that advanced classification algorithms may not have many advantages when applied to process only multispectral optical data. We observe that shrublands, crop-lands, and orchards are the dominant classes occupying 35.6%, 31.9%, and 18.4% of the country's land area, respectively. This further indicates that >50.0% of the country's land area is under agriculture. Thick forests occupy only 8.0% of the land and are almost entirely confined to forest reserves, highlighting the usefulness of these nature reserves. Our maps will provide input for research advancement, policy formulation, and environmental management at both national and subnational levels.

AB Biomes are areas of vegetation that are characterized by the same life-form. Traditional definitions of biomes have also included either geographical or climatic descriptors. This approach describes a wide range of biomes that can be correlated with characteristic climatic conditions, or climatic envelopes. The application of remote sensing technology to the frequent observation of biomes has led to a move away from the often subjective definition of biomes to one that is objective. Carefully characterized observations of life-form, by satellite, have been used to reconsider biome classification and their climatic envelopes. Five major tree biomes can be recognized by satellites based on leaf longevity and morphology: needleleaf evergreen, broadleaf evergreen, needleleaf deciduous, broadleaf cold deciduous and broadleaf drought deciduous. Observations indicate that broadleaf drought deciduous vegetation grades substantially into broadleaf evergreen vegetation. The needleleaf deciduous biome occurs in the world's coldest climates, where summer drought and therefore a drought deciduous biome are absent.
   Traditional biome definitions are quite static, implying no change in their life-form composition with time, within their particular climatic envelopes. However, this is not the case where there has been global ingress of grasslands and croplands into forested vegetation. The global spread of grasses, a new super-biome, was probably initiated 30-45 Myr ago by an increase in global aridity, and was driven by the natural spread of the disturbances of fire and animal grazing. These disturbances have been further extended over the Holocene era by human activities that have increased the land areas available for domestic animal grazing and for growing crops. The current situation is that grasses now occur in most, if not all biomes, and in many areas they dominate and define the biome. Croplands are also increasing, defining a new and relatively recent component to the grassland super-biome. In the case of both grassland and croplands, various forms of disturbance, particularly frequent disturbance, lead to continued range extensions of the biomes.

AB The introduction of high-resolution Sentinels combined with the use of high-quality digital agricultural parcel registration systems is driving the move towards at-parcel agricultural monitoring. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has introduced the concept of CAP monitoring to help simplify the management and control of farmers' parcel declarations for area support measures. This study proposes a proof of concept of this monitoring approach introducing and applying the concept of markers'. Using Sentinel-1- and -2-derived (S1 and S2) markers, we evaluate parcels declared as grassland in the Gelderse Vallei in the Netherlands covering more than 15,000 parcels. The satellite markersrespectively based on crop-type deep learning classification using S1 backscattering and coherence data and on detecting bare soil with S2 during the growing seasonaim to identify grassland-declared parcels for which (1) the marker suggests another crop type or (2) which appear to have been ploughed during the year. Subsequently, a field-survey was carried out in October 2017 to target the parcels identified and to build a relevant ground-truth sample of the area. For the latter purpose, we used a high-definition camera mounted on the roof of a car to continuously sample geo-tagged digital imagery, as well as an app-based approach to identify the targeted fields. Depending on which satellite-based marker or combination of markers is used, the number of parcels identified ranged from 2.57% (marked by both the S1 and S2 markers) to 17.12% of the total of 11,773 parcels declared as grassland. After confirming with the ground-truth, parcels flagged by the combined S1 and S2 marker were robustly detected as non-grassland parcels (F-score = 0.9). In addition, the study demonstrated that street-level imagery collection could improve collection efficiency by a factor seven compared to field visits (1411 parcels/day vs. 217 parcels/day) while keeping an overall accuracy of about 90% compared to the ground-truth. This proposed way of collecting in situ data is suitable for the training and validating of high resolution remote sensing approaches for agricultural monitoring. Timely country-wide wall-to-wall parcel-level monitoring and targeted in-season parcel surveying will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring and implementing agricultural policies.

AB Remote sensing-based assessments of large river basins such as the Krishna, which supplies water to many states in India, are useful for operationally monitoring agriculture, especially basins that are affected by abiotic stress. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series products can be used to understand cropland changes at the basin level due to abiotic stresses, especially water scarcity. Spectral matching techniques were used to identify land use/land cover (LULC) areas for two crop years: 2013-2014, which was a normal year, and 2015-2016, which was a water stress year. Water stress-affected crop areas were categorized into three classessevere, moderate and mildbased on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and intensity of damage assessed through field sampling. Furthermore, ground survey data were used to assess the accuracy of MODIS-derived classification individual products. Water inflows into and outflows from the Krishna river basin during the study period were used as direct indicators of water scarcity/availability in the Krishna Basin. Furthermore, ground survey data were used to assess the accuracy of MODIS-derived LULC classification of individual year products. Rainfall data from the tropical rainfall monitoring mission (TRMM) was used to support the water stress analysis. The nine LULC classes derived using the MODIS temporal imagery provided overall accuracies of 82% for the cropping year 2013-2014 and 85% for the year 2015-2016. Kappa values are 0.78 for 2013-2014 and 0.82 for 2015-2016. MODIS-derived cropland areas were compared with national statistics for the cropping year 2013-2014 with a R-2 value of 0.87. Results show that both rainfed and irrigated areas in 2015-2016 saw significant changes that will have significant impacts on food security. It has been also observed that the farmers in the basin tend to use lower inputs and labour per ha during drought years. Among all, access to water is the major driver determining the crop choice and extent of input-use in the basin.

AB Agricultural monitoring and assessment based on satellite data increasingly gains importance due to the growing number of available satellite sensors with high geometric and temporal resolution. Such tasks often require multiple images acquired on specific dates that among others account for inter-annual phenological variations to provide accurate results. This contribution presents an approach that links peaks of spectral separability profiles to crop phenological phases. The phases are spatially interpolated using a phenological model and ground observations. The profiles show the respective temporal development of the F-measure which is used as indicator for class-wise separability. It originates from binary classifications of vegetation indices computed for each set of a satellite data archive covering multiple years. Acquisition dates, which repeatedly show a separability maximum define phenological indicator phases. Potential alternative phases can be also defined. Experiments based on multi-temporal RapidEye satellite imagery were performed for three crops at two German test sites under different environmental conditions. The results showed that the phases yellow ripeness, heading and flowering can function as indicator phases for high spectral separability of winter barley, winter wheat and winter rapeseed. We could identify at least two identical, stable indicator phases per crop type for both test sites, which suggests the transferability and robustness of the presented approach.

AB Low-cost, consumer grade cameras have been used in recent machine vision studies. Users are faced with a choice of manual or automatic operations for obtaining quality images for classifying plant, soil, and residue for field maps and precision agriculture. A digital camera operations study was conducted for classifying uniform images of grass, bare soil, corn stalks residue, wheat straw residue, and a barium sulfate reference panel, based on color Both natural and artificial background lighting was studied. Classifications were conducted with fuzzy inference systems, built with subtractive clustering, an Adaptive-Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and ten-fold cross-validation. Each image was labeled with an integer for classification and reference. Classification systems contained from 5 to 36 rules. Rules for automatic digital camera operation were well trained (r(2) > 0.94), with low root-mean-squae errors (RMSE < 0.2). Manual digital camera operation gave lower training correlations (r(2) < 0.7) and higher root-mean-squar errors (RMSE > 3). Since predicted classification values were not integral, Zadeh's principle of maximum membership was used for final classification using trained output membership functions. Correct classification rates (CCR) for manual camera operation were low (<64%), and only slightly improved by eliminating over- and underexposed and monochromatic-lit images. The automatic digital camera provided better classification rates (>>81%). Independent background lighting luminosity and color temperature measurements did not significantly improve classification. The results suggest that low-cost, digital cameras used in automatic mode would be best for remote sensing and site-specific crop management use.

AB In this paper, we propose a new approach to the classification of hyperspectral images. The main problem with supervised methods is that the learning process heavily depends on the quality of the training data set. In remote sensing, the training set is useful only for simultaneous images or for images with the same classes taken under the same conditions; and, even worse, the training set is frequently not available. On the other hand, unsupervised methods are not sensitive to the number of labelled samples since they work on the whole image. Nevertheless, relationship between clusters and classes is not ensured. In this context, we propose a combined strategy of supervised and unsupervised learning methods that avoids these drawbacks and automates the classification process. The method is based on the general formulation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This method is applied to crop cover recognition of six hyperspectral images from the same area acquired with HyMap spectrometer during the DAISEX99 campaign. For classification purposes, six different classes are considered in this area: corn, wheat, sugar beet, barley, alfalfa, and soil. Classification accuracy results are compared to common methods: ISODATA, Learning Vector Quantization, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood, Expectation-Maximization, and Neural Networks. The good performance confirms the validity of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB The occurrence of catastrophic floods in Thailand in 2011 caused significant damage to rice agriculture. This study investigated flood-affected rice cultivation areas in the Chao Phraya River Delta (CRD) rice bowl, Thailand using time-series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The data were processed for 2008 (normal flood year) and 2011, comprising four main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct time-series MODIS vegetation indices (VIs), to filter noise from the time-series VIs by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and to mask out non-agricultural areas in respect to water-related cropping areas; (2) flood-affected area classification using the unsupervised linear mixture model (ULMM); (3) rice crop classification using the support vector machines (SVM); and (4) accuracy assessment of flood and rice crop mapping results. The comparisons between the flood mapping results and the ground reference data indicated an overall accuracy of 97.9% and Kappa coefficient of 0.62 achieved for 2008, and 95.7% and 0.77 for 2011, respectively. These results were reaffirmed by close agreement (R-2 > 0.8) between comparisons of the two datasets at the provincial level. The crop mapping results compared with the ground reference data revealed that the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients obtained for 2008 were 88.5% and 0.82, and for 2011 were 84.1% and 0.76, respectively. A strong correlation was also found between MODIS-derived rice area and rice area statistics at the provincial level (R-2 > 0.7). Rice crop maps overlaid on the flood-affected area maps showed that approximately 16.8% of the rice cultivation area was affected by floods in 2011 compared to 4.9% in 2008. A majority of the flood-expanded area was observed for the double-cropped rice (10.5%), probably due to flood-induced effects to the autumn-summer and rainy season crops. Information achieved from this study could be useful for agricultural planners to mitigate possible impacts of floods on rice production.

AB The successful launched Gaofen satellite no. 1 wide field-of-view (GF-1 WFV) camera is characterized by its high spatial resolution and may provide some potential for regional crop mapping. This study, taking the Bei'an City, Northeast China as the study area, aims to investigate the potential of GF-1 WFV images for crop identification and explore how to fully use its spectral, textural and temporal information to improve classification accuracy. In doing so, an object-based and Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used for crop mapping. The results showed that classification based on an optimized single temporal GF-1 image can achieve an overall accuracy of about 83%, and the addition of textural features can improve the accuracy by 8.14%. Moreover, the multi-temporal GF-1 data can produce a classification map of crops with an overall accuracy of 93.08% and the introduction of textural variables into multi-temporal GF-1 data can only increase the accuracy by about 1%, which suggests the importance of temporal information of GF-1 for crop mapping in comparison with single temporal data. By comparing classification results of GF-1 data with different feature inputs, it is concluded that GF-1 WFV data in general can meet the mapping efficiency and accuracy requirements of regional crop. But given the unique spectral characteristics of the GF-1 WFV imagery, the use of textual and temporal information is needed to yield a satisfactory accuracy.

AB Unsupervised classification of the landcover in the rice growing area in the Mekong river delta was performed using a combination of the ERS and RADARSAT SAR data. The ERS SAR is VV polarized while the RADARSAT SAR is HH polarized. The advantages of multiple polarization SAR in landcover classification may be realized using data from these two satellites together. The study area for this work covers the Soc Trang and Bac Lieu provinces of Vietnam where a diversity of rice cropping systems is practiced. Rice crops at different growth stages exist in the area at any one time together with other non-rice vegetation. These classes can be discriminated using a combination ofthe two SAR images.

AB Recent advances in ecological modeling have focused on novel methods for characterizing the environment that use presence-only data and machine-learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of species occurrence. These novel methods may have great potential for land suitability applications in the developing world where detailed land cover information is often unavailable or incomplete. This paper assesses the adaptation and application of the presence-only geographic species distribution model, MaxEnt, for agricultural crop suitability mapping in a rural Thailand where lowland paddy rice and upland field crops predominant. To assess this modeling approach, three independent crop presence datasets were used including a social-demographic survey of farm households, a remote sensing classification of land use/land cover, and ground control points, used for geodetic and thematic reference that vary in their geographic distribution and sample size. Disparate environmental data were integrated to characterize environmental settings across Nang Rang District, a region of approximately 1300 sq. km in size. Results indicate that the MaxEnt model is capable of modeling crop suitability for upland and lowland crops, including rice varieties, although model results varied between datasets due to the high sensitivity of the model to the distribution of observed crop locations in geographic and environmental space. Accuracy assessments indicate that model outcomes were influenced by the sample size and the distribution of sample points in geographic and environmental space. The need for further research into accuracy assessments of presence-only models lacking true absence data is discussed. We conclude that the MaxEnt model can provide good estimates of crop suitability, but many areas need to be carefully scrutinized including geographic distribution of input data and assessment methods to ensure realistic modeling results.

AB Recent advances in high throughput phenotyping have made it possible to collect large datasets following plant growth and development over time, and those in machine learning have made inferring phenotypic plant traits from such datasets possible. However, there remains a dirth of datasets following plant growth under stress conditions along with methods for inferring them using only remotely sensed data, especially under a combination of multiple stress factors such as drought, weeds and nutrient deficiency. Such stress factors and their combinations are commonly encountered during crop production and being able to accurately detect and treat such stress conditions in an automated and timely manner can provide a major boost to farm yields with minimal resource input.
   We present a generic framework for remote plant stress phenotyping that consists of a dataset with spatio-temporal-spectral data following sugarbeet crop growth under optimal, drought, low and surplus nitrogen fertilization, and weed stress conditions, along with a machine learning based methodology for systematically inferring these stress conditions from the remotely measured data. The dataset contains biweekly color images, infra-red stereo image pairs and hyperspectral camera images along with applied treatment parameters and environmental factors like temperature and humidity, collected over two months. We present a plant agnostic methodology for deriving plant trait indicators such as canopy cover, height, hyperspectral reflectance and vegetation indices along with a spectral 3D reconstruction of the plants from the raw data to serve as a benchmark. Additionally, we provide fresh and dry weight measurements for both the above (canopy) and below (beet) ground biomass at the end of the growing period to serve as indicators of expected yield. We further describe a data driven, machine learning based method to infer water, Nitrogen and weed stress using the derived plant trait indicators. We use the plant trait indicators to evaluate 8 different classification approaches from which the best classifier achieved a mean cross validation accuracy of 93, 76 and 83% for drought, nitrogen and weed stress severity classification respectively. We also show that our multi-modal approach significantly improves classifier performance over using any single modality.
   The presented framework and dataset can serve as a valuable reference for creating and comparing processing pipelines which extract plant trait indicators and infer prevalent stress factors from remote sensing data under a variety of environments and cropping conditions. These techniques can then be deployed on farm machinery or robots enabling automated, precise and timely corrective interventions for maximising yield.

AB Spatially and temporally accurate information on crop areas is a prerequisite for monitoring the multiannual dynamics of crop production. Satellite images have proven their high potential for mapping crop areas at large scales, even at the crop-species level, when a classifier is calibrated on the same image with reference data corresponding to the same period. For operational monitoring purposes, however, it is critical to develop generalized classification methodologies applicable to large scales and different years. Generalized classifiers were presented in this study as follows: a) simple cross-year calibration and application (M1); b) multiyear calibrations (M2); and c) map updating through change detection with multiyear calibrations (M3). These three methods were developed in a classical frame of object-based classifications for a time series of Landsat images with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Therein, we tested these methods for sugarcane classification in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, as sugarcane is an economically important crop that has developed substantially in the past decades. Eight years of sugarcane reference maps were used to calibrate and validate the classifiers at four different sites. The cross-year application of M1 provided a low average accuracy Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.84, while it was, on average, 0.94 for the classical same-year calibration. When the classifier was trained on a multiyear dataset (M2), the accuracies achieved average values of 0.91 in independent years. The map updating method M3 showed promising results but was not able to reach the accuracy of visual interpretation methods for detecting annual sugarcane land use change. The multiyear classifier M2 was applied to four contrasting sites and provided reliable results for new sites and years for sugarcane classification. Calibration of the machine learning algorithm on a multiyear dataset of standardized and gap-filled satellite images and reference data proved to give an accurate and space-time generalized classifier, reducing the time, cost and resources for mapping sugarcane areas at large scales.

AB MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua ( EOS PM) satellites. Linear spectral mixture models are applied to MOIDS data for the sub-pixel classification of land covers. Shaoxing county of Zhejiang Province in China was chosen to be the study site and early rice was selected as the study crop. The derived proportions of land covers from MODIS pixel using linear spectral mixture models were compared with unsupervised classification derived from TM data acquired on the same day, which implies that MODIS data could be used as satellite data source for rice cultivation area estimation, possibly rice growth monitoring and yield forecasting on the regional scale.

AB Precision agriculture (PA) constitutes one of the most critical sectors of remote sensing applications that allow obtaining spatial segmentation and within-field variability information from field crops. In the last decade, an increasing source of information is provided by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) platforms, mainly equipped with optical multispectral cameras, to map, monitor, and analyze, temporal and spatial variations of vegetation using ad hoc spectral vegetation indices (VIs). Considering the centimeter or sub-centimeter spatial resolution of UAV imagery, the geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach, is becoming prevalent in UAV remote sensing applications. In the present paper, we propose a quick and reliable semi-automatic workflow implemented to process multispectral UAV imagery and aimed at the detection and extraction of olive and citrus trees' crowns to obtain vigor maps in the framework of PA. We focused our attention on the choice of GEOBIA data input and parameters, taking into consideration its replicability and reliability in the case of heterogeneous tree orchards. The heterogeneity concerns the different tree plantation distances and composition, different crop management (irrigation, pruning, weeding), and different tree age, height, and crown diameters. The proposed GEOBIA workflow was implemented in the eCognition Developer 9.5, coupling the use of multispectral and topographic information surveyed using the Tetracam mu-MCA06 snap multispectral camera at 4 cm of ground sample distance (GSD). Three different study sites in heterogeneous citrus (Bergamot and Clementine) and olive orchards located in the Calabria region (Italy) were provided. Multiresolution segmentation was implemented using spectral and topographic band layers and optimized by applying a trial-and-error approach. The classification step was implemented as process-tree and based on a rule set algorithm, therefore easily adaptable and replicable to other datasets. Decision variables for image classification were spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, CVI) and topographic layers (DSM and CHM). Vigor maps were based on NDVI and NDRE and allowed to highlight those areas with low vegetative vigor. The accuracy assessment was based on a per-pixel approach and computed through the F-score (F). The obtained results are promising, considering that the resulting accuracy was high, with F-score ranging from 0.85 to 0.91 for olive and bergamot, respectively. Our proposed workflow, which has proved effective in datasets of different complexity, finds its strong point is the speed of execution and on its repeatability to other different crops with few adjustments. It appears worth of interest to highlights that it requests a working day of two good skilled operators in geomatics and computer image processing, from the on-field data collection to the obtaining of vigor maps.

AB The existing remote sensing image datasets target the identification of objects, features, or man-made targets but lack the ability to provide the date and spatial information for the same feature in the time-series images. The spatial and temporal information is important for machine learning methods so that networks can be trained to support precision classification, particularly for agricultural applications of specific crops with distinct phenological growth stages. In this paper, we built a high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image dataset for middle-season rice. We scheduled the UAV data acquisition in five villages of Hubei Province for three years, including 11 or 13 growing stages in each year that were accompanied by the annual agricultural surveying business. We investigated the accuracy of the vector maps for each field block and the precise information regarding the crops in the field by surveying each village and periodically arranging the UAV flight tasks on a weekly basis during the phenological stages. Subsequently, we developed a method to generate the samples automatically. Finally, we built a high-resolution UAV image dataset, including over 500,000 samples with the location and phenological growth stage information, and employed the imagery dataset in several machine learning algorithms for classification. We performed two exams to test our dataset. First, we used four classical deep learning networks for the fine classification of spatial and temporal information. Second, we used typical models to test the land cover on our dataset and compared this with the UCMerced Land Use Dataset and RSSCN7 Dataset. The results showed that the proposed image dataset supported typical deep learning networks in the classification task to identify the location and time of middle-season rice and achieved high accuracy with the public image dataset.

AB Hyperspectral imaging has become a valuable remote sensing tool due to the development of advanced remote acquisition systems with high spatial and spectral resolution, and the continuous developments on more efficient computing resources to handle the high volume of data. For this reason, hyperspectral image analysis has found important uses in precision agriculture, where the health status of crops in various stages of the production process can be assessed from their spectral signatures. This has similarly been the case for rice cultivation, which represents one of the most valuable crops worldwide in terms of gross production value, global consumption rates, and food security reserves. To maximize the productivity of this activity and minimize economic and food crop losses, various precision agriculture techniques to optimize yields by managing production inputs and monitoring plant health have been developed. Such applications include landcover classification, cultivar identification, nitrogen level assessment, chlorophyll content estimation and the identification of various factors, such as the presence of pests, weeds, disease or pollutants. The current work highlights and summarizes various aspects of interest of the main studies on hyperspectral imaging applications for rice cultivation. For instance, several tables summarize the most relevant work on the application of hyperspectral imaging for rice cultivation based on their acquisition methods, spectral region, rice species, and inferred magnitudes, among other parameters. In addition, we identify challenges across the field that limit the widespread deployment of hyperspectral imaging applications. Among these challenges, adequate modeling of various dynamic local factors and their influence on the analysis is a main concern.
   The main objective of this review is to provide a reference for future works that addresses the main challenges, and accelerate the development of deployable end user technologies to meet current global Sustainable Development Goals, in a manner that is resilient towards the increasingly dynamic growing conditions of rice plants expected by global climate change.

AB Wildlife-induced damage of agricultural crops is an unfavorable consequence of elevated population densities of wild animals, especially wild boars. For the purposes of financial compensations for crop damage, provided by either governments or hunters responsible for game numbers, it is necessary to precisely assess the range of damage and temporal change. The use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an optical sensor payload represents a potential method of obtaining data of crop conditions without the necessity to enter the field and increase the damage. We propose a novel method for delineation of damaged areas via automatic segmentation of the crop field. Our method is based on photogrammetric reconstruction of the various crop heights within the field through the use of Structure from Motion technique with subsequent automatic classification. In this case study of wheat, the range of damage was estimated with an accuracy of 99.5% and 99.3% using field global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements and classification of an orthomosaic generated from UAV-based imagery, respectively.

ID IMAGE FUSION; RESOLUTION
AB Remote sensing data and imagery is used in countless applications, but their analysis and interpretation highly depends on the spatial and spectral resolution. Fusion has been defined as the process of combining relevant image(s) information in order to synthesize it into more informative and more suitable image(s) for visual perception or computer processing, particularly for interpretation or classification. Building upon these objectives, this study explores the application of ordinary cokriging and collocated cokriging to improve the spatial resolution of the multispectral bands from a Landsat ETM+ image based on its corresponding panchromatic image. The study region, located in the central part of Colombia, has different land uses and covers such as water, forest, crop and urban areas. The geostatistical methods allowed for the fusion of the Landsat's original bands into 'fused bands', which improved the visualization and characterization of the study area. The collocated cokriging results were slightly less satisfactory than those of ordinary cokriging, possibly because of the land cover heterogeneity of the region. The results indicate that the fused bands obtained through this generally available technique can provide valuable information in digital processing of Landsat images, such as land use and land cover classification.

AB The sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a major pest of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Outbreaks of sugarcane aphid occurred in sorghum fields in Mexico and the Gulf Coast region of the United States in 2013 and subsequently spread throughout most of the sorghum-growing region. The aphid induces stress to sorghum by damaging foliage. Multispectral remote sensing can be used to detect plant stress in agricultural crops. The study investigated the utility of multispectral imagery to delineate spatially variable infestations of sugarcane aphid in commercial grain sorghum fields. Multispectral images were acquired from fields by using a Duncan Tech MS3100-CIR, a 3-band (NIR, R, G) digital camera, mounted nadir in an aircraft fuselage. ERDAS Image was used for unsupervised classification of multispectral images of five fields. The study indicated it is feasible to use multispectral imagery to detect and spatially delineate patches of plants infested by sugarcane aphids in sorghum fields. The overall classification accuracy ranged from 89 to 96% for differentiating areas damaged by sugarcane aphid from areas where plants were not damaged. Results indicated good potential for mapping spatially variable sugarcane aphid infestations in grain sorghum fields.

AB After independence in 1991, Uzbekistan introduced a policy on food security and consequently reduced the irrigated area allocated to cotton and increased the area of winter wheat. Shifting to winter wheat allowed farmers to grow a second crop outside the state-order system. The second crops are the most profitable and therefore farmers tried to maximize the area grown to this second crop. Although the second crops are the most profitable, only few studies have focused on this topic. Evidence is presented which shows that state control of crops has been extended from the main crops, cotton and wheat, to the second crops. Satellite images used for classification of main crops in two provinces of the Ferghana Valley for 2006-2011, highlight that the area utilized for second crops is dependent on the infrastructure that enables access to the water resource, not on the area's position within the irrigation system.

AB Most current studies have been applying high temporal resolution satellite data for determining paddy crop phenology, that derive into a certain vegetation indices, by using some filtering and smoothing techniques combined with threshold methods. In this paper, we introduce a time invariant detection of paddy growth stages using single temporal resolution satellite data instead of high temporal resolution with complex cropping pattern. Our system is a kernel-based regularized learner that predicts paddy growth stages from six-bands spectral of Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) satellite data. It evaluates three Kernel-based Regularized (KR) classification methods, i.e. Principal Component Regression (KR-PCR), Extreme Learning Machine (KR-ELM), and Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM). All data samples are divided into training (25%) and testing (75%) sampling, and all models are trained and tested through 10-rounds random bootstrap re-sampling method to obtain more variety on hypothesis models during learning. The best model for each classifier method is defined as the one which has the highest kappa coefficient during testing. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of each classifiers on testing are high competitive, i.e. 84.08%, 84.04%, and 84.95% respectively.

DE Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar; Supervised classification;
   Dimensionality reduction
ID DECOMPOSITION; EXTENSIONS; NEIGHBOR
AB In this paper, the linear discriminative Laplacian eigenmaps (LDLE) dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithm is introduced to C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) agricultural classification. A collection of homogenous areas of the same crop class usually presents physical parameter variation, such as the biomass and soil moisture. Furthermore, the local incidence angle also impacts a lot on the same crop category when the vegetation layer is penetrable with C-band radar. We name this phenomenon as the "observed variation of the same category" (OVSC). The most common PoISAR features, e.g., the Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier decompositions, show an inadequate performance with OVSC. In our research, more than 40 coherent and incoherent PoISAR decomposition models are stacked into the high-dimensionality feature cube to describe the various physical parameters. The LDLE algorithm is then performed on the observed feature cube, with the aim of simultaneously pushing the local samples of the same category closer to each other, as well as maximizing the distance between local samples of different categories in the learnt subspace. Finally, the classification result is obtained by nearest neighbor (NN) or Wishart classification in the reduced feature space. In the simulation experiment, eight crop blocks are picked to generate a test patch from the 1991 Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) C-band fully polarimetric data from of Flevoland test site. Locality preserving projections (LPP) and principal component analysis (PCA) are then utilized to evaluate the DR results of the proposed method. The classification results show that LDLE can distinguish the influence of the physical parameters and achieve a 99% overall accuracy, which is better than LPP (97%), PCA (88%), NN (89%), and Wishart (88%). In the real data experiment, the Chinese Hailaer nationalized farm RadarSat2 PoISAR test set is used, and the classification accuracy is around 94%, which is again better than LPP (90%), PCA (88%), NN (89%), and Wishart (85%). Both experiments suggest that the LDLE algorithm is an effective way of relieving the OVSC phenomenon. (C) 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

AB Support of the economic growth of Ukrainian agriculture requires the development and effective use of innovative technologies. In particular, satellite analysis makes it possible to monitor the state of agricultural land by monitoring their qualitative and quantitative indicators of natural and climatic characteristics. Satellite monitoring of agricultural land use in Ukraine has been developed within the World Bank program "Supporting Transparent Land Governance in Ukraine" in collaboration with EOS Data Analytics and Space Research Institute National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and State Space Agency of Ukraine. Based on the developed technology, classification maps of the land cover were built based on three data sets: ground data along roads, farmers' data, and satellite data (time series of "Sentinel-2" optical data and Sentinel-1 radar data). To create classification maps, the Random Forest algorithm was used, which is implemented on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. An accuracy assessment was carried out, and crop compared areas throughout Ukraine were obtained. According to the results of the experiment, a comparison of the classification obtained from two separate training data sets (ground data collected along roads and data of farmers) is given. As a result, a validated crop map was obtained. The map is presented on the official web-portal of the State Geocadastre of Ukraine. The main results of the analysis of the agricultural lands of Ukraine, as well as, the results of comparisons with statistical data, are presented.

AB With the passing of days, the agricultural frontier is reduced and an exact control of the amount of area destined to agriculture and which crops are developed in a region is lost. The objective of the study is to generate a supervised classification of satellite images to obtain agricultural areas through a map of land use. Four high-resolution satellite images were used, in addition to the Quantum GIS free software. The process of this project consisted of requesting the chosen images to carry out the study, in the QGIS software the red, green and blue band were joined; later an orthorectification was carried out to adjust the position of the image, an unsupervised classification was obtained to create a previous version of land use; then, in the field work, a drone was used to corroborate confusing coverage or in case of presence of a cloud in the image. Finally, supervised classification was made, according to the number of discriminated coverages. In all four images there is an important presence of agricultural use; where only in the partial image of the canton of Perez Zeledon, there is a higher percentage of land with pastures than for agriculture, the images of Leon Cortes, Pacayas and Canas show a predominance of agriculture, there being a great difference between the crops present. The derived information is important for territorial ordering, agricultural censuses, crop prediction, market regulation.

ID LAND-COVER
AB Monitoring agricultural products requires the periodic determination of land cover and the production of land use policies in an optimum way. The hazelnut is one of the important Turkish agricultural exports and Turkey provides 77% of the world's hazelnuts. In Turkey, hazelnut production exceeds the demand; new regulations have been enacted to create new land use policies. By putting into practice regulations restricting hazelnut plantation areas, a more efficient and productive hazelnut harvest Policy could be created. Therefore, more information on existing land cover is required to determine optimum (or ideal) potential hazelnut areas (PHA) and to forecast future crop production. The principle aim of this study is to create a methodology for determining existing PHA, using Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques regarding to support hazelnut policy developers and economists. This study was basically carried out in the province of Trabzon, which is one of the most important hazelnut production areas in Turkey. Landsat ETM+ image was used to generate a current land cover classification. Using the supervised classification method, overall accuracy was determined to be 84.7%. Suitable hazelnut areas were determined according to criteria settled by government regulations.

AB Soil salinity often leads to reduced crop yield and quality and can render soils barren. Irrigated areas are particularly at risk due to intensive cultivation and secondary salinization caused by waterlogging. Regular monitoring of salt accumulation in irrigation schemes is needed to keep its negative effects under control. The dynamic spatial and temporal characteristics of remote sensing can provide a cost-effective solution for monitoring salt accumulation at irrigation scheme level. This study evaluated a range of pan-fused SPOT-5 derived features (spectral bands, vegetation indices, image textures and image transformations) for classifying salt-affected areas in two distinctly different irrigation schemes in South Africa, namely Vaalharts and Breede River. The relationship between the input features and electro conductivity measurements were investigated using regression modelling (stepwise linear regression, partial least squares regression, curve fit regression modelling) and supervised classification (maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, decision tree analysis, support vector machine and random forests). Classification and regression trees and random forest were used to select the most important features for differentiating salt-affected and unaffected areas. The results showed that the regression analyses produced weak models (<0.4R squared). Better results were achieved using the supervised classifiers, but the algorithms tend to over-estimate salt-affected areas. A key finding was that none of the feature sets or classification algorithms stood out as being superior for monitoring salt accumulation at irrigation scheme level. This was attributed to the large variations in the spectral responses of different crops types at different growing stages, coupled with their individual tolerances to saline conditions.

AB The amount of open satellite data has increased tremendously in recent years, simultaneously with a continuing decrease in the price of high performance cloud computing. This can be combined with machine learning methods to perform crop type classification in the agricultural sector. In this paper, we propose a data processing chain for processing multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR data, and show how the temporal patterns of agricultural fields can be visualized to provide a valuable overview prior to classification. We then investigate the performance of 6 machine learning methods for crop type classification of 12 crop types based on 44333 fields, and achieve an overall accuracy of (94.02 +/- 0.25)% with an RBF SVM classifier. The dataset used is a subset of all the fields of the chosen crop types in Denmark in 2019, which comprises a total of 289810, or 49.34% of all fields in the country for the 2019 season. The entire data processing chain is based on open data and free open source software, thereby minimizing the cost of practical applications and future work for both industry and academia. All code used for the paper is available on GitHub.

AB Due to the rising costs of farming and an aging agrarian population, large-scale cultivated lands have been abandoned in China's rural areas, especially in remote mountainous areas. Remote sensing technology can quickly extract abandoned farmland and reveal its formation laws, and this is of great significance to food security and to the economical and intensive utilization of cultivated land. Xingning city in Guangdong, China was selected as the research area. Based on Landsat 8 images, Google Earth images, and digital elevation models, we developed an archival classification method, which we used to extract abandoned farmland in Xingning according to the variation of crop life cycles. On this basis, we reveal the spatial distribution characteristics, natural ecology, and production conditions of abandoned farmland, and we propose differentiated countermeasures. The results show that our archival classification method extracted abandoned farmland with 92% accuracy, while the accuracy of the classification supervised by the artificial neural network was 80%. Abandoned farmland on the plains of Xingning is mainly distributed around the town center and the industrial park, while that in the mountainous area is mainly located on ridges and saddles. From the point of view of natural ecology, abandoned farmland in the study area is generally located on the ridge and saddle area with a large slope close to timberland. From the perspective of agricultural production, abandoned farmland is mainly restricted by field roads and irrigation conditions. Most of the abandoned farmland is limited by both natural ecology and production conditions, and so it should be treated by classification. We expect that our results can provide a reference for the extraction of the abandoned farmland and a basis for analyzing its formation mechanism.

AB Field mapping and information on agricultural landscapes is of increasing importance for many applications. Monitoring schemes and national cadasters provide a rich source of information but their maintenance and regular updating is costly and labor-intensive. Automatized mapping of fields based on remote sensing imagery may aid in this task and allow for a faster and more regular observation. Although remote sensing has seen extensive use in agricultural research topics, such as plant health monitoring, crop type classification, yield prediction, and irrigation, field delineation and extraction has seen comparatively little research interest. In this study, we present a field boundary detection technique based on deep learning and a variety of image features, and combine it with the graph-based growing contours (GGC) method to extract agricultural fields in a study area in northern Germany. The boundary detection step only requires red, green, and blue (RGB) data and is therefore largely independent of the sensor used. We compare different image features based on color and luminosity information and evaluate their usefulness for the task of field boundary detection. A model based on texture metrics, gradient information, Hessian matrix eigenvalues, and local statistics showed good results with accuracies up to 88.2%, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of up to 0.94, and F(1)score of up to 0.88. The exclusive use of these universal image features may also facilitate transferability to other regions. We further present modifications to the GGC method intended to aid in upscaling of the method through process acceleration with a minimal effect on results. We combined the boundary detection results with the GGC method for field polygon extraction. Results were promising, with the new GGC version performing similarly or better than the original version while experiencing an acceleration of 1.3x to 2.3x on different subsets and input complexities. Further research may explore other applications of the GGC method outside agricultural remote sensing and field extraction.

AB Most current approaches to landscape scale ecosystem service assessments rely on detailed secondary data. This type of data is seldom available in regions with high levels of poverty and strong local dependence on provisioning ecosystem services for livelihoods. We develop a method to extrapolate results from a previously published village scale ecosystem services assessment to a higher administrative level, relevant for land use decision making. The method combines remote sensing (using a hybrid classification method) and interviews with community members. The resulting landscape scale maps show the spatial distribution of five different livelihood benefits (nutritional diversity, income, insurance/saving, material assets and energy, and crops for consumption) that illustrate the strong multi-functionality of the Sahelian landscapes. The maps highlight the importance of a diverse set of sub-units of the landscape in supporting Sahelian livelihoods. We see a large potential in using the resulting type of livelihood benefit maps for guiding future land use decisions in the Sahel.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Remote Sensing in agriculture makes possible the acquisition of large amount of data without physical contact, providing diagnostic tools with important impacts on costs and quality of production. Hyperspectral imaging sensors attached to airplanes or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can obtain spectral signatures, that makes viable assessing vegetation indices and other characteristics of crops and soils. However, some of these imaging technologies are expensive and therefore less attractive to familiar and/or small producers. In this work a method for estimating Near Infrared (NIR) bands from a low-cost and well-known RGB camera is presented. The method is based on a weighted sum of NIR previously acquired from pre-classified uniform areas, using hyperspectral images. Weights (belonging degrees) for NIR spectra were obtained from outputs of K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. The results showed that presented method has potential to estimate near infrared band for agricultural areas by using only RGB images with error less than 9%.

AB Time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data have been widely used for large area crop mapping. However, the temporal crop signatures generated from these data were always accompanied by noise. In this study, a denoising method combined with Time series Inverse Distance Weighted (T-IDW) interpolating and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was presented. The detail crop planting patterns in Hebei Plain, China were classified using denoised time-series MODIS NDVI data at 250 m resolution. The denoising approach improved original MODIS NDVI product significantly in several periods, which may affect the accuracy of classification. The MODIS NDVI-derived crop map of the Hebei Plain achieved satisfactory classification accuracies through validation with field observation, statistical data and high resolution image. The field investigation accuracy was 85% at pixel level. At county-level, for winter wheat, there is relatively more significant correlation between the estimated area derived from satellite data with noise reduction and the statistical area (R (2) = 0.814, p < 0.01). Moreover, the MODIS-derived crop patterns were highly consistent with the map generated by high resolution Landsat image in the same period. The overall accuracy achieved 91.01%. The results indicate that the method combining T-IDW and DWT can provide a gain in time-series MODIS NDVI data noise reduction and crop classification.

AB Optimal resource planning is essential in developing countries, particularly in the Middle East, where scarcity of resources represents a major challenge for development. To eliminate inappropriate human influence on natural resources and develop a strategy for appropriate land use, land evaluation (LE) assessments are crucial to be properly carried out. In this context, land suitability (LS) assessment was performed in Port Said Governorate. LE and LS were carried out for several field crops, vegetable crops, forage crops, and fruit trees. LS was matched based on the requirements of the selected crops, then it was associated with physiographic map units using a GIS platform. Different sources of remote sensing-derived maps were integrated and homogenized to increase the accuracy of physiographic. Moreover, land quality and soil characteristics mapping were conducted in Arc GIS spatial model to generate LS using geostatistical methods. The results revealed that structure of LS classification was four classes only, moderately suitable S-2 = 36%, marginally suitable S-3 = 30%, currently not suitable N-1 = 23%, and permanently not suitable for crops N-2 = 11% of total area of land), respectively, of land. The actual LS produced in association with physiographic units. The potential crops suitability was produced considering the significant fluctuation in land use in the area. Fluctuation changes in land use; fish farms led to increase organic matter (OM) to 2.3 from 0.4% in some soil profiles due to the fish farms practices in the area, and reduce soil electrical conductivity by 50% due to leaching effect. Severe limitations of crop suitability are due to defects associated with organic OM, soil compaction, salinization, alkalinization and carbonates. This work helps to achieve optimum use of available land resources to help in soil improvement and prevent land degradation. Comprehensive LS assessment is required to grow appropriate crops on marginal lands. Hence, there is an urgent need for developing a crop suitability framework for optimum use of land in the area. This approach provides an integrated approach to identify suitable crops for areas with physical constraints.

AB Hyperspectral determination of soil types has the potential to become an important addition to the methods used for classification and mapping of soils. In this study laboratory measured spectra of different soils, vegetation and crop residue were combined to simulate hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. The overall aim was to examine the spectral unmixing of these materials under laboratory conditions to better understand the limits to prediction of soil types and determination of cover fractions. Two different methods were utilized to mix spectra of the soil and vegetation and substantial differences were observed in the unmixing results from the different image types, particularly in mixed pixels. Results found pure soils were easily distinguished from each other when not mixed with vegetation, while some mixes of soil and vegetation were confused as pure soil spectra. The accuracy of abundance fractions retrieved in the unmixing process also varied substantially with soil type and vegetation cover.

DT Article
AB Studies for estimating cultivated area and yield of rice using remote sensing data acquired from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) system with six bands (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7) were conducted. Three images taken on different days were visually and digitally analysed for the estimation of rice cultivated area. This was obtained with over 90 per cent classification accuracy. False colour composite of 5R, 4G, 3B was selected for the identification of rice cultivated area at maturity stage. Band combination of 1, 3, 4 and 5 was selected as an appropriate subset in the digital analysis for the estimation of rice areas. An attempt was made to develop a relationship between reflectance values and actual grain yield using an image of the fully ripened stage of the crop. High correlation was observed with reflectance values of some bands and yields. A computerized plant process model was adopted for the simulation of rice growth and yield. This was used for estimating yield per unit area.

AB In this study, land use change and its effects on level and volume of groundwater were investigated. Using satellite images and field measurements, change in land uses was determined from 1998 to 2007. By analyzing the observation wells data and preparing the zoning maps in GIS, groundwater level fluctuations were assessed. Considering the area corresponding to these fluctuations, changes in aquifers volume were calculated. The rain gauge and synoptic stations data were used to calculate meteorological parameters and evapotranspiration. The water requirement of the main crops was determined by CROPWAT software. Results showed an increase in average rainfall and crops water requirement. The classification of satellite images showed that 11,800 ha was increased in lands under irrigated crops cultivation, while 27,655 ha of rangeland was declined in the region. Groundwater levels dropped an average of 7 m, equal to 63.4 MCM reductions in volume of water in the aquifer.

AB Crop area mapping is important for tracking agricultural production and supporting food security. Spaceborne approaches using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) now allow for mapping crop area at moderate spatial and temporal resolutions. Multi-frequency SAR data is highly useful for crop monitoring because backscatter response from vegetation canopies is wavelength dependent. This study evaluates the utility of C-band Sentinel-1B (Sentinel-1) and L-band ALOS-2 (PALSAR) data, collected during the 2019 growing season, for generating accurate active crop extent (crop vs. non-crop) classifications over an agricultural region in western Canada. Evaluations were performed against the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada satellite-based Annual Cropland Inventory (ACI), an open data product that maps land cover across the extent of Canada's agricultural land. Classifications were performed using the temporal coefficient of variation (CV) approach, where an optimal crop/non-crop delineating CV threshold (CVthr) is selected according to Youden's J-statistic. Results show that crop area mapping agreed better with the ACI when using Sentinel-1 data (83.5%) compared to PALSAR (73.2%). Analysis of performance by crop reveals that PALSAR's poorer performance can be attributed to soybean, urban, grassland, and pasture ACI classes. This study also compared CV values to in situ wet biomass data for canola and soybeans, showing that crops with lower biomass (soybean) had correspondingly lower CV values.

AB Cereal grain is one of the main export commodities of Australian agriculture. Over the past decade, crop yield forecasts for wheat and sorghum have shown appreciable utility for industry planning at shire, state, and national scales. There is now an increasing drive from industry for more accurate and cost-effective crop production forecasts. In order to generate production estimates, accurate crop area estimates are needed by the end of the cropping season. Multivariate methods for analysing remotely sensed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 16-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery within the cropping period (i.e. April-November) were investigated to estimate crop area for wheat, barley, chickpea, and total winter cropped area for a case study region in NE Australia. Each pixel classification method was trained on ground truth data collected from the study region. Three approaches to pixel classification were examined: (i) cluster analysis of trajectories of EVI values from consecutive multi-date imagery during the crop growth period; (ii) harmonic analysis of the time series (HANTS) of the EVI values; and (iii) principal component analysis (PCA) of the time series of EVI values. Images classified using these three approaches were compared with each other, and with a classification based on the single MODIS image taken at peak EVI. Imagery for the 2003 and 2004 seasons was used to assess the ability of the methods to determine wheat, barley, chickpea, and total cropped area estimates. The accuracy at pixel scale was determined by the percent correct classification metric by contrasting all pixel scale samples with independent pixel observations. At a shire level, aggregated total crop area estimates were compared with surveyed estimates. All multi-temporal methods showed significant overall capability to estimate total winter crop area. There was high accuracy at pixel scale (> 98% correct classification) for identifying overall winter cropping. However, discrimination among crops was less accurate. Although the use of single-date EVI data produced high accuracy for estimates of wheat area at shire scale, the result contradicted the poor pixel-scale accuracy associated with this approach, due to fortuitous compensating errors. Further studies are needed to extrapolate the multi-temporal approaches to other geographical areas and to improve the lead time for deriving cropped-area estimates before harvest.

AB Agriculture monitoring is a key task for producers, governments and decision makers. The analysis of multitemporal remote sensing data provides a cost-effective way to perform this task. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been successfully used in temporal modeling problems, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS) are the state-of-the-art in image classification, mainly due to their ability to capture spatial context. In this work, we propose the use of a hybrid network architecture for crop mapping that combines RNNs and CNNs. We evaluate this architecture experimentally upon a Sentinel-1A database from a tropical region in Brazil. The ability of recurrent networks to model temporal context is compared with the conventional image stacking approach. The impact of using CNN learned features rather than context aware handcrafted features is also investigated. In our analysis the hybrid architecture achieved better average class accuracy than alternative approaches based on image stacking and GLCM features.

AB Yield gaps, which reflect the difference between the yield a grower achieves in a field, and the water-limited yield potential of that field, have been extensively discussed in the last decade. To date, most analyses have occurred at regional levels, and derived insight through surveys, remote sensing, or small scale targeted case studies. Here, we provide an analysis based on a survey of 250 fields from 2015 to 2018 inclusive. Biotic factors, nutrients and crop yields are all monitored. Crop models were calibrated locally at each site. Regression and Classification Trees (RCART) were used to determine the key drivers of the yield gap in wheat, and again used to identify attributes contributing to a yield gap for a field regardless of crop type. The mean yield gap from 697 wheat crops, collected over 4 years, was 1.03 t/ha (MSE = 2.23 t/ha). This equated to a mean wheat yield gap of 20.3 % +/- S.D 36.2 %. 18 % of fields had repeated yield gaps of 20 % or more, irrespective of crop type. The RCART analysis demonstrated that for wheat, the yield potential of the crop was the most important predictor, where fields with high yield potentials were most likely to have a higher yield gap. Nitrogen was the second most important predictor. Yield gaps of wheat crops grown in high yielding regions were also related to crop rotation, leaf diseases and weed populations. In low rainfall zones, wheat yield gaps were related to the presence of soil pathogens including Pratylenchus sp., Pythium sp. and Fusarium sp. In conclusion, yield potential and nitrogen are important predictors of the yield gap. Increasing nitrogen inputs would address the yield gap in 25 % of wheat crops. In 22 % of wheat crops, increasing nitrogen inputs will not correct the gap, as other biotic stresses are often present, that require sophisticated agronomic intervention. In the remaining 53 % of wheat fields yield gaps were less than 0.37 t/ha.

AB The identification of biotic stress of rice crops using handheld sensing devices is a challenge, as computationally intensive machine learning models are difficult to be executed in these devices. This challenge is exacerbated in farmers' fields located in remote regions with limited internet connectivity. Thus, an individualiased plant-specific solution to detect biotic stress due to crop infections is required in farms adopting digital agricultural practices. The existing biotic stress detection solutions are deficient in their ability to make decisions in real-time. It is required to have a system that is capable of making decisions at the edge in handheld devices having limited computational capability. This paper proposes RiceBioS, an AI-based deep learning-enabled handheld device for identifying biotic stress in rice crops using the computational capabilities of handheld devices. RiceBioS adopts Edge-as-a-Service (EaaS) as an approach for classifying rice crop images into two categories - healthy and stressed. The biotic stress condition is further diagnosed into two types of infections, fungal (rice blast) and bacterial (bacterial leaf blight of rice) by pruning the shrunk deep learning classification model and incorporating an automated RoI detection and feature extraction workflow, which makes use of adaptive thresholding and hierarchial masking techniques to perform dimensionality reduction. While RiceBioS demonstrates a test accuracy of 93.25%, it exhibits a negligible tradeoff on a smartphone after deployment. This cutting edge solution helps the farmers make informed decisions based on real-time insights provided by the user-friendly mobile application interface of RiceBioS.

AB Increasing pressure to feed the growing population with scarce water resources requires accurate and routine cropland mapping. This paper develops and implements a rule-based automated cropland classification algorithm (AccA) using multi-sensor remote sensing data. Pixel-by-pixel accuracy assessments showed that ACCA produced an overall accuracy of >= 96 percent (K-hat = 0.8) when tested using independent data layers. Furthermore, AccA-generated county cropland areas showed high agreement (R-square values >= 0.94) when compared with three independent data sources: (a) US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data layer derived cropland areas, (b) county specific crop acreage data from the Farm Service Agency, and (c) the Census of Agriculture data for the 58 counties in California.

AB Soil salinity is the key factor limiting agricultural expansion over poorly drained soils. In Saudi Arabia, the main source of irrigational water is the groundwater aquifers. Therefore, groundwater resources are under constant pressure and over exploited to fulfil the irrigational water demands. Moreover, soils in Saudi Arabia are poor and lack tolerable drainage system. Harsh agricultural environments thrust the farmers to maximize daily groundwater pumpage to overcome the substantial daily evapotranspiration caused by the massive turbulent heat fluxes in the designated study area. Normalized difference salinity index was generated based on remotely sensed data derived from Landsat 8 acquired on April 14th, 2014, after proper radiometric and atmospheric corrections. Thematic map of soil salinity was generated and then reclassified into four classes based on the natural break classification techniques. On the other hand, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is another remotely sensed vegetation index established to envisage the effect of different soil salinity on the crop vigorously. FAPAR index was estimated using remote sensing data derived from the medium-spectral resolution imaging spectrometer on the same day of acquisition for consistency reasons. Results demonstrated that the FAPAR index is highly dependent on soil salinity. Higher soil salinity values corresponded to lower FAPAR values. Findings of the current research will help decision makers and decision takers to take soil salinity into consideration in future strategic plans.

AB Consumer-grade cameras are being increasingly used for remote sensing applications in recent years. However, the performance of this type of cameras has not been systematically tested and well documented in the literature. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of original and resolution-reduced images taken from two consumer-grade cameras, a RGB camera and a modified near-infrared (NIR) camera, for crop identification and leaf area index (LAI) estimation. Airborne RGB and NIR images taken over a 6.5-square-km cropping area were mosaicked and aligned to create a four-band mosaic with a spatial resolution of 0.4 m. The spatial resolution of the mosaic was then reduced to 1, 2, 4, 10, 15 and 30 m for comparison. Six supervised classifiers were applied to the RGB images and the four-band images for crop identification, and 10 vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the images were related to ground-measured LAI. Accuracy assessment showed that maximum likelihood applied to the 0.4-m images achieved an overall accuracy of 83.3% for the RGB image and 90.4% for the four-band image. Regression analysis showed that the 10 VIs explained 58.7% to 83.1% of the variability in LAI. Moreover, spatial resolutions at 0.4, 1, 2 and 4 m achieved better classification results for both crop identification and LAI prediction than the coarser spatial resolutions at 10, 15 and 30 m. The results from this study indicate that imagery from consumer-grade cameras can be a useful data source for crop identification and canopy cover estimation.

AB The main purpose of this study is to present a methodology for mapping and monitoring temporal signatures of Mediterranean crops over several years in irrigated areas, and to study their inter-annual dynamics. These goals were achieved by remote sensing using 36 Landsat images from 2002 to 2005. Four crop maps, one for each year, with six agricultural categories and a thematic accuracy of 93%, 95%, 96% and 94% were obtained using a hybrid classifier. A mean of nine images produced these highly accurate results, but the absence of one image in the growth period of 2002 resulted in lower accuracies, particularly in fruit trees (85% of user accuracy). This highlights the importance of a multi-temporal approach based on a relatively large number of images. After the classification results were validated, two parameters were used to characterize the dynamics of the four crops (rice, maize, alfalfa and fruit trees): greenness, extracted from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and wetness, calculated from the Tasselled Cap Wetness (TCW) Index. In order to differentiate the wetness origin of crops, an analysis of local daily precipitation (which could cause significant anomalies in the TCW coefficients) and water stored in the Susqueda reservoir (which may result in farmers making important management decisions when water is limited) was conducted during this four-year period. After applying statistical analysis, the results showed that, of the four crops analysed, rice, alfalfa and fruit trees had more stable dynamics than maize, which was planted later in case of water deficit at the beginning of the irrigation campaign (in 2002) and earlier when the deficit occurred later (in 2005).

ID RULE-BASED CLASSIFICATION; RANDOM FORESTS; NO-TILL; IMAGERY
AB We used an object-oriented approach in conjunction with the Random Forest algorithm to classify agricultural practices, including tillage (till or no-till (NT)), crop intensity, and grassland-based conservation reserve (CR). The object-oriented approach allowed for per-field classifications and the incorporation of contextual elements in addition to spectral features. Random Forest is a classification tree-based advanced classifier that avoids data over-fitting associated with many tree-based models and incorporates an unbiased internal classification accuracy assessment. Landsat satellite imagery was chosen for its continuous coverage, cost effectiveness, and image accessibility. Classification results for 2007 included producer's accuracies of 91% for NT and 31% for tillage when applying Random Forest to image objects generated from a May Landsat image. Low classification accuracies likely were attributed to the misclassification of conservation-based tillage practices as NT. Results showed that the binary separation of tillage from NT management is likely not appropriate due to surface spectral and textural similarities between NT and conservation-type tillage practices. Crop and CR lands resulted in producer's accuracies of 100% and 90%, respectively. Crop and fallow producer's accuracies were 95% and 82% in the 2007 classification, despite post-senesced vegetation; misclassification within the fallow class was attributed to pixel-mixing problems in areas of narrow (<100 m) strip management. A between-date normalized difference vegetation index approach was successfully used to detect areas having "changed" in vegetation status between the 2007 and prior image dates; classified "changed" objects were then merged with "unchanged" objects to produce crop status maps. Field crop intensity was then determined from the multi-year analysis of generated crop status maps. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mostly motivated by the crop field classification problem and the automated computational methodology for the extraction of agricultural fields with a uniform crop distribution from satellite data, we propose an indirect approach for the image segmentation which is based on the concept of a piecewise constant approximation of the slope-based vegetation indices. We discuss in detail the consistency of the new statement of segmentation problem and its solvability. We mainly focus on the rigor mathematical substantiation of the proposed approach, deriving the corresponding optimality conditions, and we show that the new optimization problem is rather a flexible and powerful model of variational image segmentation problems. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by numerical experiences with images that have been delivered by satellite Sentinel-2. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrologic condition in Kien Giang province on the west coast of Vietnam's Mekong Delta is unique in the sense that it has extensive saline water intrusion during the dry season every year. Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions.

AB The classification of agricultural tillage systems has proven challenging in the past using traditional classification methods due to the similarity of spectral reflectance signatures of soils and senescent crop residues. In this study, five classification methods were examined to determine the most suitable classification algorithm for the identification of no-till (NT) and traditional tillage (TT) cropping methods: minimum distance (MD), Mahalanobis distance, Maximum Likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapping (SAM), and the cosine of the angle concept (CAC). A Landsat ETM+ image acquired over southern Michigan and northern Indiana was used to test these classification methods. Each classification method was validated with 293 ground truth sampling locations collected commensurate with the satellite overpass. Classification accuracy was then assessed using error matrix analysis, Kappa statistics, and tests for statistical significance. The results indicate that of the classification routines examined, the two spectral angle methods were superior to the others. The cosine of the angle concept algorithm outperformed all the other classification routines for tillage practice identification and mapping, yielding an overall accuracy of 97.2% (Kappa = 0.959).

AB A workflow headed up to identify crops growing under plastic-covered greenhouses (PCG) and based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data is developed in this article. This workflow is made up of four steps: (i) data pre-processing, (ii) PCG segmentation, (iii) binary pre-classification between greenhouses and non-greenhouses, and (iv) classification of horticultural crops under greenhouses regarding two agronomic seasons (autumn and spring). The segmentation stage was carried out by applying a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm on the pre-processed WorldView-2 data. The free access AssesSeg command line tool was used to determine the more suitable multi-resolution algorithm parameters. Two decision tree models mainly based on the Plastic Greenhouse Index were developed to perform greenhouse/non-greenhouse binary classification from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A time series, attaining overall accuracies of 92.65% and 93.97%, respectively. With regards to the classification of crops under PCG, pepper in autumn, and melon and watermelon in spring provided the best results (F around 84% and 95%, respectively). Data from the Sentinel-2A time series showed slightly better accuracies than those from Landsat 8.

AB With the continuous development of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data technology, and intelligent agriculture have become hot topics in agricultural science and technology research. Machine learning is one of the core topics in artificial intelligence, and its application has penetrated every aspect of human social life. In modern agricultural intelligent management and decision making, machine learning plays an important role in crop classification, crop disease and insect pest prediction, agricultural product price prediction, and other aspects of management and decision-making processes in agriculture. To detect and recognize the latest research developing features in a quantitative and visual way, and based on machine learning methods in agricultural management, the authors of this paper used CiteSpace bibliometric methods to analyze relevant studies on the development process and hot spots. High-value references, productive authors, country and institution distributions, journal visualizations, research topics, and emerging trends were reviewed and analyzed. According to the keyword visualization and high-value references, machine learning approaches focus on sustainable agriculture, water resources, remote sensing, and machine learning methods. The research mainly focuses on six topics: learning technology, land environment, reference evapotranspiration, decision support systems for river geography, soil management, and winter wheat, while learning technology has been the most popular in recent years.

TI Detection of mosaic virus disease in cassava plants by sunlight-induced

AB Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is a prominent virus infection that causes considerable crop damage and yield reduction. Early detection of crop damage by remote sensing could be a useful tool for initiating remedial measures to reduce further crop damage. This article presents a non-destructive method for detection and classification of CMD infection, based on the red: far-red chlorophyll (chl) fluorescence image ratio. This pilot study was carried out in 14 varieties of potted cassava plants (Manihot esculenta Crantz) with a multispectral imaging system (MSIS) consisting of an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera. Sunlight-induced chl fluorescence (SICF) images of plant leaves were recorded using the MSIS at the Fraunhofer lines of O-2-B at 687 nm and O-2-A at 759.5 nm and their off-lines at 684 and 757.5 nm. The recorded images were analysed using the Fraunhofer line discrimination (FLD) technique to extract the SICF from the solar reflectance in the recorded images. The chl fluorescence image ratio (red: far-red, F-687:F-760) was computed and correlated with the laser-induced chl fluorescence (LICF) ratio (F-685:F-735) determined by point monitoring, chl content variation, and the net photosynthetic rate (P-n). The scatter plot of the F-687:F-760 image ratio showed good discrimination between different levels of CMD infection as evidenced by the high sensitivity and specificity values. It is observed that the fluorescence image ratio (F-687:F-760) has a good correlation with P-n (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.85), chl content (R-2 = 0.82), and the LICF ratio (F-685:F-735) (R-2 = 0.80), thereby highlighting the potential of the SICF image ratio in the discrimination of CMD infection. The results clearly indicate that changes in the red: far-red fluorescence image ratio due to CMD stress can easily be detected at an early stage and the technique has great potential for monitoring the health of crops and vegetation from proximal sensing platforms.

AB The importance of automatic classification procedures applied on digital images (aerial orthophotographs, satellite images, etc.) for the recognition of soil coverage or morphological elements (geological discontinuities, ground textures, etc.) is widely confirmed by several studies on environmental issues. As far as crop shelters are concerned, there is no thematic cartography generally available mainly due to the temporary character of this type of constructions. Yet a wide and deep knowledge of localization and territorial density of crop shelters can be of great interest in strategic choices for environmental and landscape planning and protection. Aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of image processing application to the classification of crop shelter sites and its accuracy. An intensively-cultivated area located in South-Eastern Sicily was selected to perform the localization of greenhouses and other type of shelters (e.g. vineyards coverings). A mosaicked digital orthophotograph of Sicilian territory was subset to obtain the study area. This image was georeferenced and analyzed by an image processing software. A methodology based on supervised classification of the image was found as the most adequate to the classification of crop shelters. According to this methodology suitable classes were selected on the basis of signatures related to specific sample areas. The classification was then refined by using neighbourhood and contiguity analysis algorithms. The results of the analyses allowed to recognize, localize the crop shelters and quantify their planimetric area. The latter was also compared with the attributes of georeferenced feature classes based on visual recognition. The application of this methodology to adjacent areas showed good results. The methodology developed in this study could provide the technical cartography with a new thematic layer of crop shelter coverage. This application, among the others, could be useful to show the modifications in crop shelter localization during years in a specific area.

AB In Mediterranean landscapes, the encroachment of pyrophytic shrubs is a driver of more frequent and larger wildfires. The high-resolution mapping of vegetation cover is essential for sustainable land planning and the management for wildfire prevention. Here, we propose methods to simplify and automate the segmentation of shrub cover in high-resolution RGB images acquired by UAVs. The main contribution is a systematic exploration of the best practices to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a segmentation network architecture (U-Net) to detect shrubs in heterogeneous landscapes. Several semantic segmentation models were trained and tested in partitions of the provided data with alternative methods of data augmentation, patch cropping, rescaling and hyperparameter tuning (the number of filters, dropout rate and batch size). The most effective practices were data augmentation, patch cropping and rescaling. The developed classification model achieved an average F1 score of 0.72 on three separate test datasets even though it was trained on a relatively small training dataset. This study demonstrates the ability of state-of-the-art CNNs to map fine-grained land cover patterns from RGB remote sensing data. Because model performance is affected by the quality of data and labeling, an optimal selection of pre-processing practices is a requisite to improve the results.

AB The development of reliable methods for the estimation of crown architecture parameters is a key issue for the quantitative evaluation of tree crop adaptation to environment conditions and/or growing system. In the present work, we developed and tested the performance of a method based on low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for the estimation of olive crown parameters (tree height and crown diameter) in the framework of olive tree breeding programs, both on discontinuous and continuous canopy cropping systems. The workflow involved the image acquisition with consumer-grade cameras on board a UAV and orthomosaic and digital surface model generation using structure-from-motion image reconstruction (without ground point information). Finally, geographical information system analyses and object-based classification were used for the calculation of tree parameters. Results showed a high agreement between remote sensing estimation and field measurements of crown parameters. This was observed both at the individual tree/hedgerow level (relative RMSE from 6% to 20%, depending on the particular case) and also when average values for different genotypes were considered for phenotyping purposes (relative RMSE from 3% to 16%), pointing out the interest and applicability of these data and techniques in the selection scheme of breeding programs.

AB Forest regeneration assessment considers the abundance and condition of crop trees as well as the level of competing vegetation. Most remote sensing research has been conducted on conifer crop tree detection and assessment using imagery acquired in deciduous leaf-off conditions. Some research on competition assessment has been conducted using leaf-on imagery, but it is too costly and time consuming to require both leaf-off and leaf-on image acquisition and analysis for complete regeneration assessment. This paper evaluates the potential of automated methods for assessment of woody stem competition using very high-resolution (2 cm) leaf-off imagery. The intent is to couple the competition-evaluation methods with previously developed leaf-off conifer assessment methods. The automated method combined texture analysis, classification, and line detection. Results show that competition measures extracted from the processed imagery agreed well with estimates derived from both manual competition interpretation and field measurements. Manual estimates slightly outperformed automated extraction when compared against field measurements, but the best approach may be to combine them to optimize processing time and achieve the highest possible precision, particularly in areas where competition abundance is estimated to be close to a given silvicultural decision threshold.

AB Mapping crop distribution with remote sensing data is of great importance for agricultural production, food security and agricultural sustainability. Winter rape is an important oil crop, which plays an important role in the cooking oil market of China. The Jianghan Plain and Dongting Lake Plain (JPDLP) are major agricultural production areas in China. Essential changes in winter rape distribution have taken place in this area during the 21st century. However, the pattern of these changes remains unknown. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of winter rape from 2000 to 2017 on the JPDLP were analyzed. An artificial neural network (ANN)-based classification method was proposed to map fractional winter rape distribution by fusing moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) data and high-resolution imagery. The results are as follows: (1) The total winter rape acreages on the JPDLP dropped significantly, especially on the Jianghan Plain with a decline of about 45% during 2000 and 2017. (2) The winter rape abundance keeps changing with about 20-30% croplands changing their abundance drastically in every two consecutive observation years. (3) The winter rape has obvious regional differentiation for the trend of its change at the county level, and the decreasing trend was observed more strongly in the traditionally dominant agricultural counties.

AB The European Commission promotes new technologies and data generated by the Copernicus Programme. These technologies are intended to improve the management of the Common Agricultural Policy aid, implement new monitoring controls to replace on-the-spot checks, and apply up to 100% of the applications continuously for an agricultural year. This paper presents a generic methodology developed for implementing monitoring controls. To achieve this, the dataset provided by the Sentinel-2 time series is transformed into information through the combination of classifications with machine learning using random forest and remote sensing-based biophysical indices. This work focuses on monitoring the helpline associated with rice cultivation, using 13 Sentinel-2 images whose grouping and characteristics change depending on the event or landmark being sought. Moreover, the functionality to check, before harvesting the crop, that the area declared is equal to the area cultivated is added. The 2020 results are around 96% for most of the metrics analysed, demonstrating the potential of Sentinel-2 for controlling subsidies, particularly for rice. After the quality assessment, the hit rate is 98%. The methodology is transformed into a tool for regular use to improve decision making by determining which declarants comply with the crop-specific aid obligations, contributing to optimising the administrations' resources and a fairer distribution of funds.

TI SACRA - a method for the estimation of global high-resolution crop

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION INDEX; SNOW-COVER; MODIS; PHENOLOGY; MISSION; MODEL
AB To date, many studies have performed numerical estimations of biomass production and agricultural water demand to understand the present and future supply-demand relationship. A crop calendar (CC), which defines the date or month when farmers sow and harvest crops, is an essential input for the numerical estimations. This study aims to present a new global data set, the SAtellite-derived CRop calendar for Agricultural simulations (SACRA), and to discuss advantages and disadvantages compared to existing census-based and model-derived products. We estimate global CC at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin using satellite-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, which corresponds to vegetation vitality and senescence on the land surface. Using the time series of the NDVI averaged from three consecutive years (2004-2006), sowing/harvesting dates are estimated for six crops (temperate-wheat, snow-wheat, maize, rice, soybean and cotton). We assume time series of the NDVI represent the phenology of one dominant crop and estimate CCs of the dominant crop in each grid. The dominant crops are determined using harvested areas based on census-based data. The cultivation period of SACRA is identified from the time series of the NDVI; therefore, SACRA considers current effects of human decisions and natural disasters. The difference between the estimated sowing dates and other existing products is less than 2 months (<62 days) in most of the areas. A major disadvantage of our method is that the mixture of several crops in a grid is not considered in SACRA. The assumption of one dominant crop in each grid is a major source of discrepancy in crop calendars between SACRA and other products. The disadvantages of our approach may be reduced with future improvements based on finer satellite sensors and crop-type classification studies to consider several dominant crops in each grid. The comparison of the CC also demonstrates that identification of wheat type (sowing in spring or fall) is a major source of error in global CC estimations.

AB Irrigation accounts for 70% of global water use by humans and 33-40% of global food production comes from irrigated croplands. Accurate and timely information related to global irrigation is therefore needed to manage increasingly scarce water resources and to improve food security in the face of yield gaps, climate change and extreme events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Unfortunately, this information is not available for many regions of the world. This study aims to improve characterization of global rain-fed, irrigated and paddy croplands by integrating information from national and sub-national surveys, remote sensing, and gridded climate data sets. To achieve this goal, we used supervised classification of remote sensing, climate, and agricultural inventory data to generate a global map of irrigated, rainfed, and paddy croplands. We estimate that 314 million hectares (Mha) worldwide were irrigated circa 2005. This includes 66 Mha of irrigated paddy cropland and 249 Mha of irrigated non-paddy cropland. Additionally, we estimate that 1047 Mha of cropland are managed under rain-fed conditions, including 63 Mha of rain-fed paddy cropland and 985 Mha of rain-fed non-paddy cropland. More generally, our results show that global mapping of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands is possible by combining information from multiple data sources. However, regions with rapidly changing irrigation or complex mixtures of irrigated and non-irrigated crops present significant challenges and require more and better data to support high quality mapping of irrigation.

TI The effect of dew on the use of RADARSAT-1 for crop monitoring -
   Choosing between ascending and descending orbits
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Radar sensors, like RADARSAT-1. can be a valuable tool for monitoring agricultural crops. RADARSAT-1 imagery can be acquired regardless of cloud cover, and the satellite can be programmed to collect imagery, in a wide range of beam modes and incidence angles. This flexibility significantly increases the revisit schedule, thereby ensuring that images can be acquired during key crop growth stages. Users also have the flexibility of choosing acquisitions during either ascending or descending orbits. However, the condition of agricultural targets can change diurnally, and consequently, care must be taken in choosing between RADARSAT-1's dawn and dusk orbits, In temperate regions. early morning dew, is often present on the crop canopy at the time of the satellite overpass. Consequently, this study used fine mode dawn, dusk image pairs acquired over western Canada to examine the potential effect of dew on operational crop mapping. The data consistently demonstrated that backscatter increased when dew was present on the canopy. However. overall crop separability did not appear to be affected by the presence of dew. These results indicate that although choice of orbit is less important for crop classification, the probability of dew on the canopy must be carefully considered when users are extracting quantitative crop information from radar imagery.

AB The identification of crop areas marked by biotic and abiotic factors is a challenge in precision agriculture (PA). Remote sensing and supervised segmentation of hyperspectral images (HIs) have become a fast and precise solution of PA for the identification of problems in crops. However, wellknown problems for knowledge extraction in HIs are related to data volumes and capacity for modeling each phenomenal due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Some techniques for dealing with dimensionality, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), are promising, but they cannot assure a compromise between the segmentation effectiveness and reduction of dimensionality. In this paper, a multi-objective method based on Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2 and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier is proposed for supervised segmentation of HIs dealing with the problem of dimensionality. Experiments with three datasets and cross-validation showed that the proposed method reduced the average number of bands between 75.4% and 88.2% for each evaluation. In addition to reducing the number of bands, statistical tests showed that our method had a pixel classification performance equivalent or more significant than other state-of-the-art methods. Based on the results, the method is promising for band selection in HIs and can contribute to segmentation.

AB Remote sensing is important to precision agriculture and the spatial resolution provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is revolutionizing precision agriculture workflows for measurement crop condition and yields over the growing season, for identifying and monitoring weeds and other applications. Monitoring of individual trees for growth, fruit production and pest and disease occurrence remains a high research priority and the delineation of each tree using automated means as an alternative to manual delineation would be useful for long-term farm management. In this paper, we detected citrus and other crop trees from UAV images using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, followed by a classification refinement using superpixels derived from a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The workflow performed well in a relatively complex agricultural environment (multiple targets, multiple size trees and ages, etc.) achieving high accuracy (overall accuracy = 96.24%, Precision (positive predictive value) = 94.59%, Recall (sensitivity) = 97.94%). To our knowledge, this is the first time a CNN has been used with UAV multi-spectral imagery to focus on citrus trees. More of these individual cases are needed to develop standard automated workflows to help agricultural managers better incorporate large volumes of high resolution UAV imagery into agricultural management operations.

AB This work introduces a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based technique to classify agricultural crops. The method recognizes different crops by analyzing their spectral profiles over a sequence of satellite images. Different HMMs, one for each of the considered crop classes, are used to relate the varying spectral response along the crop cycles with plant phenology. The method assigns for a given image segment the crop class whose corresponding HMM presents the highest probability of emitting the observed sequence of spectral values. Experiments were conducted upon a sequence of 12 previously classified LANDSAT images. The performance of the proposed multitemporal classification method was compared to that of a monotemporal maximum likelihood classifier, and the results indicated a remarkable superiority of the HMM-based method, which achieved an average of no less than 93% accuracy in the identification of the correct crop, for sequences of data containing a single crop class.

AB Crop yield is a key element in rural development and an indicator of national food security. A method that could estimate crop yield over large hilly areas would be highly desirable. Methods including high spatial resolution satellite imagery have the potential to achieve this objective. This paper describes a method of integrating QuickBird imagery with a production efficiency model (PEM) to estimate crop yield in Zhonglianchuan, a hilly area on Loess Plateau, China. In the PEM model, crop yield is a function of the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) and light-use efficiency (LUE). Based on the high spatial resolution QuickBird imagery, a land cover classification is used to attribute a class-specific LUE. The fAPAR is related to spectral vegetation indices (SVI), which can be derived from the satellite images. The LUE, WAR and incident PAR data were combined to estimate the crop yield. Farmer-reported crop yield data in 80 representative plots were used to validate the model output. The results indicated QuickBird imagery can improve the accuracy of predicted results relative to the Landsat TM image. The predicted yield approximated well with the data reported by the farmers (r(2) = 0.86; n = 80). The spatial distributions of crop yield derived here also offers valuable information to manage agricultural production and understand ecosystem functioning. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series allows describing the rice phenological cycle by the backscattering time signature. Therefore, the advent of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 program expands studies of radar data (C-band) for rice monitoring at regional scales, due to the high temporal resolution and free data distribution. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model has reached state-of-the-art in the pattern recognition of time-sequenced data, obtaining a significant advantage at crop classification on the remote sensing images. One of the most used approaches in the RNN model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and its improvements, such as Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). Bi-LSTM models are more effective as their output depends on the previous and the next segment, in contrast to the unidirectional LSTM models. The present research aims to map rice crops from Sentinel-1 time series (band C) using LSTM and Bi-LSTM models in West Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). We compared the results with traditional Machine Learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Normal Bayes (NB). The developed methodology can be subdivided into the following steps: (a) acquisition of the Sentinel time series over two years; (b) data pre-processing and minimizing noise from 3D spatial-temporal filters and smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filter; (c) time series classification procedures; (d) accuracy analysis and comparison among the methods. The results show high overall accuracy and Kappa (>97% for all methods and metrics). Bi-LSTM was the best model, presenting statistical differences in the McNemar test with a significance of 0.05. However, LSTM and Traditional Machine Learning models also achieved high accuracy values. The study establishes an adequate methodology for mapping the rice crops in West Rio Grande do Sul.

AB The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of potentialities of the new Sentinel-1 radar images for mapping the different crops in the Camargue region in the South France. The originality relies on deep learning techniques. The analysis is carried out on multitemporal Sentinel-1 data over an area in Camargue, France. 50 Sentinel-1 images processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from May 2017 to September 2017. We revealed that even with classical machine learning approaches (K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine), good performance classification could be achieved with F-measure/Accuracy greater than 86 % and Kappa coefficient better than 0.82. We found that the results of the two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers clearly outperformed the classical approaches. Finally, our analyses of Camargue area results show that the same performance was obtained with two different RNN-based classifiers on the Rice class, which is the most dominant crop of this region, with a F-measure metric of 96 %. These results thus highlight that in the near future, these RNN-based techniques will play an important role in the analysis of remote sensing time series.

AB For farmers, policymakers, and government agencies, it is critical to accurately define agricultural crop phenology and its spatial-temporal variability. At the moment, two approaches are utilized to report crop phenology. On one hand, land surface phenology provides information about the overall trend, whereas weekly reports from USDA-NASS provide information about the development of particular crops at the regional level. High-cadence earth observations might help to improve the accuracy of these estimations and bring more precise crop phenology classifications closer to what farmers demand. The second component of the proposed solution requires the use of robust classifiers (e.g., random forest, RF) capable of successfully managing large data sets. To evaluate this solution, this study compared the output of a RF classifier model using weather, two different satellite sources (Planet Fusion; PF and Sentinel-2; S-2), and ground truth data to improve maize (Zea mays L.) crop phenology classification using two regions of Kansas (Southwest and Central) as a testbed during the 2017 growing season. Our findings suggests that high temporal resolution (PF) data can significantly improve crop classification metrics (f1-score = 0.94) relative to S-2 (f1-score = 0.86). Additionally, a decline in the f1-score between 0.74 and 0.60 was obtained when we assessed the ability of S-2 to extend the temporal forecast for crop phenology. This research highlights the critical nature of very high temporal resolution (daily) earth observation data for crop monitoring and decision making in agriculture.

AB Timely crop acreage and distribution information are the basic data which drive many agriculture related applications. For identifying crop types based on remote sensing, methods using only a single image type have significant limitations. Current research that integrates fine and coarser spatial resolution images, using techniques such as unmixing methods, regression models, and others, usually results in coarse resolution abundance without sufficient detail within pixels, and limited attention has been paid to the spatial relationship between the pixels from these two kinds of images. Here we propose a new solution to identify winter wheat by integrating spectral and temporal information derived from multi-resolution remote sensing data and determine the spatial distribution of sub-pixels within the coarse resolution pixels. Firstly, the membership of pixels which belong to winter wheat is calculated using a 25-m resolution resampled Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image based on the Bayesian equation. Then, the winter wheat abundance (acreage fraction in a pixel) is assessed by using a multiple regression model based on the unique temporal change features from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data. Finally, winter wheat is identified by the proposed Abundance-Membership (AM) model based on the spatial relationship between the two types of pixels. Specifically, winter wheat is identified by comparing the spatially corresponding 10x10 membership pixels of each abundance pixel. In other words, this method takes advantage of the relative size of membership in a local space, rather than the absolute size in the entire study area. This method is tested in the major agricultural area of Yiluo Basin, China, and the results show that acreage accuracy (Aa) is 93.01% and sampling accuracy (As) is 91.40%. Confusion matrix shows that overall accuracy (OA) is 91.4% and the kappa coefficient (Kappa) is 0.755. These values are significantly improved compared to the traditional Maximum Likelihood classification (MLC) and Random Forest classification (RFC) which rely on spectral features. The results demonstrate that the identification accuracy can be improved by integrating spectral and temporal information. Since the identification of winter wheat is performed in the space corresponding to each MODIS pixel, the influence of differences of environmental conditions is greatly reduced. This advantage allows the proposed method to be effectively applied in other places.

AB During the last decades, massive amounts of satellite images are becoming available that can be enriched with semantic annotations for the creation of value-added earth observation products. One challenge is to extract knowledge from the raw satellite data in an automated way and to effectively manage the extracted information in a semantic way, to allow fast and accurate decisions of spatiotemporal nature in a real operational scenario. In this work, we present a framework that combines supervised learning for crop type classification on satellite imagery time-series with semantic web and linked data technologies to assist in the implementation of rule sets by the European common agricultural policy (CAP). The framework collects georeferenced data that are available online and satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission. We analyze image time-series that cover the entire cultivation period and link each parcel with a specific crop. On top of that, we introduce a semantic layer to facilitate a knowledge-driven management of the available information, capitalizing on ontologies for knowledge representation and semantic rules, to identify possible farmers noncompliance according to the Greening 1 (crop diversification) and SMR 1 rule (protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates) rules of the CAP. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed integrated approach in three different scenarios for crop type monitoring and consistency checking for noncompliance to the CAP rules: the smart sampling of on-the-spot checks; the automatic detection of CAP's Greening 1 rule; and the automatic detection of susceptible parcels according to the CAP's SMR 1 rule.

AB Land use/cover (LCLU) is considered as one of the most serious environmental challenges that threatens developed and less developed countries. LCLU changes' monitoring using the integration of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) and their predicting using an artificial neural network (ANN) in the western part of the Tarim River Basin (Aksu), north-western Xinjiang-China, from 1990 to 2030 have been investigated first time through satellite imageries available. The imageries of 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were downloaded from GLCF and USGS websites. After digital image processing, the object-oriented image classification approach was applied. The ANN method with MOLUSCE Plugin was used to simulate the LCLU changes in 2020, 2025, and 2030. GIS has also been used to calculate the distance from the road and water and etc. The simulation results of 2010 and 2015 were validated using classification data with Kappa coefficient. The results showed high accuracy of the classification and prediction as the validation of simulated 2010 and 2015 maps to the referenced maps have high accuracy of Kappa 84 and 88%, respectively. The results revealed that the land cover classes forest-, grass-, wet-, and barren land have been decreased from 50.01, 13.06, 8.24, and 1.06% in 1990 to 32.03, 3.06, 6.26, and 0.97% in 2015, respectively, while the land use classes, crop or farm land, and urban land have been increased almost double from 25.5 and 2.13% in 1990 to 53.71 and 3.86% from the total area in 2015, respectively. For the prediction, forest- and wetlands will loss more than half of their areas by 2030, the grass land will be cleared completely to be only 1.3% from the total study area, while the urban land will be increased to be 4.4% or the double of 1990. These results are attributed to population growth and expanding of agriculture land on the grass land, but the effect of climate was weak as the rainfall increased during the study period. Causes and effects of the LCLU changes were briefly discussed. The output of the study serves as useful tools for policy and decision makers combatting natural resources misused in arid lands.

AB Image classification is an important process of land use and land cover mapping. For effective image classification, quite a few aspects have to be considered including the accessibility of quality of satellite imagery, ground control points, a accurate classification method and the skill and proficiency of the user in the processes involved. This study classifies and maps the land use/land cover (LULC) of the Sagar Island using two images (1975 and 2015) and additionally verifies the precision of the classification method used. The study has been divided into two sections (1) Landuse/Land cover (LULC) classification and (2) accuracy assessment. Unsupervised classification was performed using Non-Parametric Rule and change detection was done for the 40 years study period. It was observed that 7.60% of mangrove vegetation's were converted to cropland. Similarly, 40.26% of agricultural (mono-crop) land was converted to agriculture land, 1.48% of mud flat was converted to mangrove swamps, 1.87% wetland area converted to aquaculture land, and 22.54% agricultural (mono-crop) land converted to the settlement with homestead orchard respectively. Other LULC conversions are agricultural (mono-crop) land to cropland (40.26%), mud flat to shallow water (1.36%), wetlands to cropland (0.055%). The study had an overall classification accuracy of 79.53% and Kappa coefficient (K) 0.7465. This overall classification accuracy of the LULC maps is quite significant in terms of their potential use for land use change modeling of Sagar Island.

AB Lodging, a commonly occurring rice crop disaster, seriously reduces rice quality and production. Monitoring rice lodging after a typhoon event is essential for evaluating yield loss and formulating suitable remedial policies. The availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 open-access remote sensing data provides large-scale information with a short revisit time to be freely accessed. Data from these sources have been previously shown to identify lodged crops. In this study, therefore, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data after a typhoon event were combined to enable monitoring of lodging rice to be quickly undertaken. In this context, the sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features (SF) and spectral indices (SI) extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to lodged rice were analyzed, and a model was constructed for selecting optimal sensitive parameters for lodging rice (OSPL). OSPL has high sensitivity to lodged rice and strong ability to distinguish lodged rice from healthy rice. After screening, Band 11 (SWIR-1) and Band 12 (SWIR-2) were identified as optimal spectral indices (OSI), and VV, VV + VH and Shannon Entropy were optimal SAR features (OSF). Three classification results of lodging rice were acquired using the Random Forest classification (RFC) method based on OSI, OSF and integrated OSI-OSF stack images, respectively. Results indicate that an overall level of accuracy of 91.29% was achieved with the combination of SAR and optical optimal parameters. The result was 2.91% and 6.05% better than solely using optical or SAR processes, respectively.

AB The inherent interpretability properties of fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCSs) are undoubtedly one of their major advantages when compared to conventional black-box classifiers. In this paper we present a preliminary study of how the so-called technique of feature construction can prove useful in the context of land cover classification tasks using remotely sensed imagery. The method is integrated into a previously proposed genetic FRBCS (GFRBCS) and applied in a crop classification task using a multispectral satellite image. The experimental analysis shows that feature construction can effectively identify very useful hidden relationships among the initial variables of the problem.

AB Land-cover monitoring is one of the core applications of remote sensing. Monitoring and mapping changes in the distribution of agricultural land covers provide a reliable source of information that helps environmental sustainability and supports agricultural policies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can contribute considerably to this monitoring effort. The first objective of this research is to extend the use of time series of polarimetric data for land-cover classification using a decision tree classification algorithm. With this aim, RADARSAT-2 (quad-pol) and Sentinel-1 (dual-pol) data were acquired over an area of 600 km(2) in central Spain. Ten polarimetric observables were derived from both datasets and seven scenarios were created with different sets of observables to evaluate a multitemporal parcel-based approach for classifying eleven land-cover types, most of which were agricultural crops. The study demonstrates that good overall accuracies, greater than 83%, were achieved for all of the different proposed scenarios and the scenario with all RADARSAT-2 polarimetric observables was the best option (89.1%). Very high accuracies were also obtained when dual-pol data from RADARSAT-2 or Sentinel-1 were used to classify the data, with overall accuracies of 87.1% and 86%, respectively. In terms of individual crop accuracy, rapeseed achieved at least 95% of a producer's accuracy for all scenarios and that was followed by the spring cereals (wheat and barley), which achieved high producer's accuracies (79.9%-95.3%) and user's accuracies (85.5% and 93.7%).

AB In Asia, rice is a staple cereal crop and the continent accounts for about 90 % of the global rice production and consumption. Statistics on the areas planted with rice or production of paddy rice are fundamental to agriculture-related decisions or policy-making. Asia-Rice Crop Estimation & Monitoring (Asia-RiCE) aims to develop rice-related information, such as paddy field maps, rice growing conditions, yield, and production, using remote sensing tools and disseminate the same at the local and global scales. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the identification of rice-planted areas by using multi-temporal SAR images; a software named INternational Asian Harvest mOnitoring system for Rice (INAHOR) was developed to manipulate the proposed algorithm. The INAHOR uses the imagery observed both at the time of planting of rice and grown-up stages. In this study, two thresholds needed for the INAHOR were optimized based on the detailed land cover data collected through a field survey. Rice-planted areas across the study area in Japan were identified by the INAHOR using the RADARSAT-2 Wide Fine beam mode data. The classification results of RADARSAT-2 VV and VH polarizations were compared. The data with VH polarization showed a higher total accuracy of 83 % with -20.5 dB and 3.0 dB for the minimum and range thresholds, respectively. The INAHOR is currently being used with the RADARSAT-2, ALOS, and ALOS-2 SAR data in the Southeast Asian countries to assess the robustness of the thresholds and classification accuracies under the framework of Asia-RiCE.

AB Naked cropland elimination is an important part of Beijing Olympic ecological project. In this paper, Multi-temporal satellite data were used to monitor and position the naked croplands. Three Landsat TM images and two "Beijing-1" Small-Satellite images were selected to calculate NDVI series according to crop phenological calendars and investigated information of agricultural cropping structures in Beijing suburb. Based on the phenological spectral characteristics of main agricultural land use types, a classification scheme was proposed to extract the naked croplands. Considering the structural characteristic hierarchical classification and various demands of feature selection in different periods, decision tree algorithm and a stepwise masking technology were employed to extract typical crops in each season, and hence the naked croplands were left. Accuracy assessment of the naked croplands in winter and spring were performed with comparison of the monitoring areas with statistical data. The results show that the area of the naked croplands in winter and spring was 170368.1ha in Beijing. The areas of the top five districts (Yanqing, Shunyi, Daxing, Miyun and Tongxian) were 17933.3ha, taking a percent of 69.2% of that of Beijing. The areas of the naked cropland were 25719.6 ha, 4485.4 ha and 3325 ha in summer, autumn and all the year round respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that our method would fast and simply monitor agricultural land use.

AB The scarcity of water for agricultural use is a serious problem that has increased due to intense droughts, poor management, and deficiencies in the distribution and application of the resource. The monitoring of crops through satellite image processing and the application of machine learning algorithms are technological strategies with which developed countries tend to implement better public policies regarding the efficient use of water. The purpose of this research was to determine the main indicators and characteristics that allow us to discriminate the phenological stages of maize crops (Zea mays L.) in Sentinel 2 satellite images through supervised classification models. The training data were obtained by monitoring cultivated plots during an agricultural cycle. Indicators and characteristics were extracted from 41 Sentinel 2 images acquired during the monitoring dates. With these images, indicators of texture, vegetation, and colour were calculated to train three supervised classifiers: linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours (kNN) models. It was found that 45 of the 86 characteristics extracted contributed to maximizing the accuracy by stage of development and the overall accuracy of the trained classification models. The characteristics of the Moran's I local indicator of spatial association (LISA) improved the accuracy of the classifiers when applied to the L*a*b* colour model and to the near-infrared (NIR) band. The local binary pattern (LBP) increased the accuracy of the classification when applied to the red, green, blue (RGB) and NIR bands. The colour ratios, leaf area index (LAI), RGB colour model, L*a*b* colour space, LISA, and LBP extracted the most important intrinsic characteristics of maize crops with regard to classifying the phenological stages of the maize cultivation. The quadratic SVM model was the best classifier of maize crop phenology, with an overall accuracy of 82.3%.

DE corn; crop condition; crop yied; polarization; RADARSAT-2
AB In agriculture, soil and crop conditions change from day to day and throughout the growing season. Agricultural targets also vary spatially with differences observed from field to field, as well as within individual fields. The heterogeneity of corn-growing conditions in Mexico makes accurate data for crop type, crop condition and crop yield prediction difficult to obtain. Yield predictions are needed by the federal government to estimate, ahead of harvest time, the amount of corn required to be imported in order to meet the expected domestic shortfall. In this project a methodology for the estimation of corn yield ahead of harvest time is developed which uses radar and optical remote sensing and which specifically considers the corn-growing situation in Central Mexico. Radar based crop type classification requires data sets with multiple polarizations. Recent research to assess relative classification accuracies of multi-polarized combinations for target crops using airborne data has been reported. In addition to identifying crop type and variety, identifying crop growth stage is valuable. Crop condition, loosely defined as the vigor or health of a crop in a particular growth stage, is related to crop productivity and yield; however, the relationship is complex. Main crop condition indicators include biomass, height, leaf area and contents (if plant water, chlorophyll and nitrogen. Crop-type and crop-condition mapping are among the applications that are expected to benefit the most from the technical enhancements embodied by RADARSAT-2. The potential of RADARSAT-1 data for these applications has been rated as "limited", whereas for RADARSAT-2 data this potential is anticipated to be "strong". The Science and Operational Applications Research for RADARSAT-2 Program (SOAR) is promoting the evaluation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities by providing images to selected research projects which include the present one.
   The objectives of this project are: a) use RADARSAT-2 data and optical data to determine cultivated areas and monitor crop condition for obtaining better estimations of crop yield; b) obtain polarization signatures from RADARSAT-2 data for corn and relate these to Leaf Area Index and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) crop parameters and vegetation indexes, to establish indicators of crop condition and produce estimates for crop yield; c) use field data collected for three key corn crop growth stages over 300 pilot plots during 2001-2006, and increase the number of plots to build a database to support accuracy studies using RADARSAT-2 data.
   The expected benefits of this project are: to obtain knowledge about crop type, crop condition and crop yield with better accuracy than with current methodologies; to support national corn farmers associations; to design agriculture related activities within State agriculture plans; to support the corn product industry and aid government decision making. Relevant results and economical impact will imply operational usage of RADARSAT- 2 data in the agricultural sector in Mexico.

AB Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) is located at the eastern of South Sumatra Province, 2 degrees 30'-4 degrees 15' latitude and 104 degrees 20'-106 degrees 00' longitude. Digital image of land was captured from Landsat 8 satellite path 124/row 062. Landsat 8 is new generation satellite which has two sensors, Operation Land Manager (OLI) and Thermal Infra-Red Sensor (TIRS). In preprocessing step, there are a geometric correction, radiometric correction, and cropping of the digital images which resulting coordinated geography. Classification uses maximum likelihood estimator algorithm. In segmentation process and classification, grey value spread is into evenly after applying histogram technique. The results of entropy value are7.42 which is the highest of result image classification, then the smallest entropy value in the result of correction mapping are 6.39. The three of them prove that they have enough high entropy value. Then the result of peatlands classification is given overall accuracy value = = 94.0012% and overall kappa value = 0.9230 so the result of classification can be considered to be right.

DE Horticultural plantations; high resolution data; texture; object
   oriented; classification accuracy; semi-automatic
AB High resolution satellite images are associated with large variance and thus, per pixel classifiers often result in poor accuracy especially in delineation of horticultural crops. In this context, object oriented techniques are powerful and promising methods for classification. In the present study, a semi-automatic object oriented feature extraction model has been used for delineation of horticultural fruit and plantation crops using Erdas Objective Imagine. Multi-resolution data from Resourcesat LISS-IV and Cartosat-1 have been used as source data in the feature extraction model. Spectral and textural information along with NDVI were used as inputs for generation of Spectral Feature Probability (SFP) layers using sample training pixels. The SFP layers were then converted into raster objects using threshold and clump function resulting in pixel probability layer. A set of raster and vector operators was employed in the subsequent steps for generating thematic layer in the vector format. This semi-automatic feature extraction model was employed for classification of major fruit and plantations crops viz., mango, banana, citrus, coffee and coconut grown under different agro-climatic conditions. In general, the classification accuracy of about 75-80 per cent was achieved for these crops using object based classification alone and the same was further improved using minimal visual editing of misclassified areas. A comparison of on-screen visual interpretation with object oriented approach showed good agreement. It was observed that old and mature plantations were classified more accurately while young and recently planted ones (3years or less) showed poor classification accuracy due to mixed spectral signature, wider spacing and poor stands of plantations. The results indicated the potential use of object oriented approach for classification of high resolution data for delineation of horticultural fruit and plantation crops. The present methodology is applicable at local levels and future development is focused on up-scaling the methodology for generation of fruit and plantation crop maps at regional and national level which is important for creation of database for overall horticultural crop development.

AB Accurate crop type mapping provides numerous benefits for a deeper understanding of food systems and yield prediction. Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification accuracies for crop types. We compared the results of the 3D U-Net to the state-of-the-art deep learning networks, including SegNet and 2D U-Net, as well as commonly used machine learning method such as Random Forest. The results showed (1) fusing multi-temporal SAR and optical data yields higher training overall accuracies (OA) (3D U-Net 0.992, 2D U-Net 0.943, SegNet 0.871) and testing OA (3D U-Net 0.941, 2D U-Net 0.847, SegNet 0.643) for crop type mapping compared to standalone multi-temporal SAR or optical data (2) optical data fused with denoised SAR data via a denoising convolution neural network (OA 0.912) performed better for crop type mapping compared to optical data fused with boxcar (OA 0.880), Lee (OA 0.881), and median (OA 0.887) filtered SAR data and (3) 3D convolutional neural networks perform better than 2D convolutional neural networks for crop type mapping (SAR OA 0.912, optical OA 0.937, fused OA 0.992).

AB The olives orchard is one of the most important crops in Spain. The long-term sustainability in marginal areas depends on good agricultural practices. One of them is the maintenance of grass cover in order to prevent the soil erosion, especially in areas of steep slopes. Therefore determining the percentage of grass cover in these areas it is essential.
   This research aims the grass cover determination in olive orchard using remote sensing techniques. To achieve this, frames of olive orchard were captured by the airborne sensor Ultracam D Vexcel. Where the selected area was an olive orchard of 32000 hectares in the Valle de los Pedroches in the South of Spain, where 64 digital aerial photographs and data of 173 agricultural plots were used. Object-oriented classification technique was applied in this frames, this means a previous image segmentation allowing isolating the grass cover in the olive orchard. Thus, it is allowed to work with the image at object level, which greatly expands the amount of information that can be extracted from it. The software used was eCognition (c). The resulting objects are the basis for subsequent classification. The results show that was possible achieving an overall accuracy of 96.10% and an excellent Kappa statistic (94.10%) for object-oriented classification. In conclusion this technique opens new perspectives for the determination of grass cover in olive orchards.

AB Land cover and crop-types classification are of great importance for monitoring agricultural production and land-use patterns. Many classification approaches have used different parameters settings. In this paper, we investigate the modern classifiers using the most effective parameters to improve the classification accuracy of the major crops and land covers that exist in Sentinel-2 images for Fayoum region of Egypt. Four major crop-types and four major land-cover types are classified. This paper investigates the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) supervised classifiers. The experimental results show that the SVM and the RF report more robust results. The k-NN reports the least accuracy especially for crop types. The RT, K-NN, ANN, and SVM record 92.7%, 92%, 92.1% and 94.4% respectively. The SVM classifier out-performs the k-NN, ANN and RF classifiers.

AB Estimating crop area is a key factor for any crop monitoring and agricultural management system. Having annual information on crop acreage and production change is sufficient for agricultural decision makers and planners. The aim of this study is to monitor changes in cultivated areas and to estimate wheat crop area using satellite imagery with different spatial resolutions and time series normalize different vegetation index (NDVITs). The study is focusing on using accuracy assessment from maximum likelihood classification methods applied to multi-spatial resolution scenes (30, 20 and 10 meters) derived from Landsat8 and Sentinel-2 satellites. More specifically, NDVITs estimates from Landsat 30m, Sentinel-2 (20m), and (10m) spatial resolutions are compared to discriminate wheat crop. The study area is located in El-Minya governorate, Egypt. The results showed that the accuracy of using NDVITs data from different imageries showed higher accuracy than using one single date. The NDVITs estimate from the Sentinel-2(10m) has (81%) as an overall accuracy and (0.74) as Kappa coefficient where Sentinel-2(20m) NDVITs data has (69.38%) as an overall accuracy and (0.58) as Kappa coefficient. The lowest accuracy (64.38%) and Kappa coefficient (0.51) resulted from occurred with Landsta8 (NDVITs) data.

AB The derivation of leaf area index (LAI) from satellite optical data has been the subject of a large amount of work. In contrast, few papers have addressed the effective model inversion of high resolution satellite images for a complete series of data for the various crop species in a given region. The present study is focused on the assessment of a LAI model inversion approach applied to multitemporal optical data, over an agricultural region having various crop types with different crop calendars. Both the inversion approach and data sources are chosen because of their wide use. Crops in the study region (Barrax, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) include: cereal, corn, alfalfa, sugar beet, onion, garlic, papaver. Some of the crop types (onion, garlic, papaver) have not been addressed in previous studies. We use in-situ measurement sets and literature values as a priori data in the PROSPECT+ SAIL models to produce Look Up Tables (LUTs). Those LUTs are subsequently used to invert Landsat-TM and Landsat-ETM+ image series (12 dates from March to September 2003). The Look Up Tables are adapted to different crop types, identified on the images by ground survey and by Landsat classification. The retrieved LAI values are compared to in-situ measurements available from the campaign conducted in mid July-2003. Very good agreement (a high linear correlation) is obtained for LAI values from 0.1 to 6.0. LAI maps are then produced for each of the 12 dates. The LAI temporal variation shows consistency with the crop phenological stages. The inversion method is favourably compared to a method relying on the empirical relationship between LAI and NDVI from Landsat data. This offers perspectives for future optical satellite data that will ensure high resolution and high temporal frequency. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing can aid in discriminating crop residue owing to the ability of narrow bands to capture the unique absorption feature of soil and residue. The present study was carried out to find out the suitable narrow spectral bands and hyper-spectral indices for discriminating wheat residue (stubble and burnt). Ground spectra of wheat residue and the adjoining soil were collected using the ASD fieldspecTM spectroradiometer. The best spectral range was derived using the Stepwise Discriminating Analysis (SDA). 'F'statistics from one-way ANOVA was used to find out the best index for discriminating wheat residue from soil. EO1-Hyperion data over Anand-Borsad region of Gujarat state in India was acquired free of cost from USGS earth explorer website (http://eo1.usgs.gov/) to apply the field based result over the Hyperion scene. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification scheme was used to generate the wheat residue cover over the Hyperion scene. Among the hyperspectral indices evaluated for this study the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) was found to be the best and hence CAI was used to classify the Hyperion scene for discriminating crop residue in field and also the burnt wheat residue. Results indicated that the wave bands at 10 nm width in the SWIR spectral region specifically from 1500-1700nm and 1900 to 2300nm are most suitable for wheat residue discrimination. The SAM classification technique is suitable for classifying the wheat residues with an overall accuracy of around 80 % whereas classification based on CAI could be used successfully to identify both wheat stubble and the burnt residues. This study concluded that wheat residue can be mapped for a large area with an accuracy of 80 % using the space borne hyperspectral data with.

AB Black soil is one of the most productive soils with high organic matter content. Crop residue covering is important for protecting black soil from alleviating soil erosion and increasing soil organic carbon. Mapping crop residue covered areas accurately using remote sensing images can monitor the protection of black soil in regional areas. Considering the inhomogeneity and randomness, resulting from human management difference, the high spatial resolution Chinese GF-1 B/D image and developed MSCU-net+C deep learning method are used to mapping corn residue covered area (CRCA) in this study. The developed MSCU-net+C is joined by a multiscale convolution group (MSCG), the global loss function, and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) based on U-net and the full connected conditional random field (FCCRF). The effectiveness of the proposed MSCU-net+C is validated by the ablation experiment and comparison experiment for mapping CRCA in Lishu County, Jilin Province, China. The accuracy assessment results show that the developed MSCU-net+C improve the CRCA classification accuracy from IOUAVG = 0.8604 and Kappa(AVG) = 0.8864 to IOUAVG = 0.9081 and Kappa(AVG) = 0.9258 compared with U-net. Our developed and other deep semantic segmentation networks (MU-net, GU-net, MSCU-net, SegNet, and Dlv3+) improve the classification accuracy of IOUAVG/Kappa(AVG) with 0.0091/0.0058, 0.0133/0.0091, 0.044/0.0345, 0.0104/0.0069, and 0.0107/0.0072 compared with U-net, respectively. The classification accuracies of IOUAVG/Kappa(AVG) of traditional machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), are 0.576/0.5526 and 0.6417/0.6482, respectively. These results reveal that the developed MSCU-net+C can be used to map CRCA for monitoring black soil protection.

AB A multi-temporal/multi-sensor field experiment was conducted within the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) in Spain, in order to retrieve useful information from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and upcoming Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) missions. The objective of the experiment was first to identify which radar observables are most sensitive to the development of crops, and then to define which crop parameters the most affect the radar signal. A wide set of radar variables (backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators) acquired by Radarsat-2 were analyzed and then exploited to determine variables characterizing the crops. Field measurements were fortnightly taken at seven cereals plots between February and July, 2015. This work also tried to optimize the crop characterization through Landsat-8 estimations, testing and validating parameters such as the leaf area index, the fraction of vegetation cover and the vegetation water content, among others. Some of these parameters showed significant and relevant correlation with the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (R > 0.60). Regarding the radar observables, the parameters the best characterized were biomass and height, which may be explored for inversion using SAR data as an input. Moreover, the differences in the correlations found for the different crops under study types suggested a way to a feasible classification of crops.

ID PHENOLOGY
AB Crop growth monitoring is an important phenomenon for agriculture classification, yield estimation, agriculture field management, improve productivity, irrigation, fertilizer management, sustainable agricultural development, food security and to understand how environment and climate change effect on crops especially in Russia as it has a large and diverse agricultural production. In this study, we assimilated monthly crop phenology from January to December 2018 by using the NDVI time series derived from moderate to high Spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel and Landsat data in cropland field at Samara airport area, Russia. The results support the potential of Sentinel and Landsat data derived NDVI time series for accurate crop phenological monitoring with all crop growth stages such as active tittering, jointing, maturity and harvesting according to crop calendar with reasonable thematic accuracy. This satellite data generated NDVI based work has great potential to provide valuable support for assessing crop growth status and the above-mentioned objectives with sustainable agriculture development.

AB Natural and semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes are likely to come under increasing pressure with the global population set to exceed 9 billion by 2050. These non-cropped habitats are primarily made up of trees, hedgerows and grassy margins and their amount, quality and spatial configuration can have strong implications for the delivery and sustainability of various ecosystem services. In this study high spatial resolution (0.5 m) colour infrared aerial photography (CIR) was used in object based image analysis for the classification of non-cropped habitat in a 10,029 ha area of southeast England. Three classification scenarios were devised using 4 and 9 class scenarios. The machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) was used to reduce the number of variables used for each classification scenario by 25.5 % +/- 2.7%. Proportion of votes from the 4 class hierarchy was made available to the 9 class scenarios and where the highest ranked variables in all cases. This approach allowed for misclassified parent objects to be correctly classified at a lower level. A single object hierarchy with 4 class proportion of votes produced the best result (kappa 0.909). Validation of the optimum training sample size in RF showed no significant difference between mean internal out-of-bag error and external validation. As an example of the utility of this data, we assessed habitat suitability for a declining farmland bird, the yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella), which requires hedgerows associated with grassy margins. We found that similar to 22% of hedgerows were within 200 m of margins with an area >183.31 m(2). The results from this analysis can form a key information source at the environmental and policy level in landscape optimisation for food production and ecosystem service sustainability.

AB Crop biomass plays an important role in food security and global carbon cycle. Recently, remote sensing technology has been proven to be an effective tool for biomass estimation with fewer field surveys. In this study, we try to map summer maize biomass using SPOT-5 (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre-5) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) MOD09Q1/A1 data. First, the STARFM (spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model) algorithm was applied to generate high spatio-temporal resolution NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and LSWI (land surface water index) datasets through fusing SPOT-5 and MODIS data. The blended NDVI and LSWI exhibited high correlations with the referenced SPOT-5 NDVI and LSWI (0.72 <= R-NDVI(2) <= 0.76, 0.74 <= R-LSWI(2) <= 0.86). Afterwards, a MLC (maximum likelihood classification) and ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique) method was employed to cluster time series NDVI, result shows that 91.3% maize fields were correctly identified and the overall accuracy was 89.8% with a kappa of 0.7957, which was 10-20% higher than the classification of MODIS-NDVI. Finally, NDVI, LSWI and meteorological data were inserted into a light use efficiency model to estimate aboveground biomass, the estimated results that involved blended data correlated well with the measured values (0.66 <= R-2 <= 0.75, 23.5 <= RMSE <= 163.4 g/m(2)), and more accurate than the estimation using MODIS data (0.51 <= R-2 <= 0.66, 27.1 <= RMSE <= 174.4 g/m(2)). In addition, biomass distribution maps were generated based on the crop classification and estimation results. Our research provided a reliable method for the biomass mapping of summer maize with SPOT-5 and MODIS data, which is also very meaningful for the precision agriculture.

AB We have mapped the broad groups of crops grown each summer and winter, from 1987 to 2017, for a 300,000km 2 region of Queensland, Australia. These maps are part of a legislated decision-making process for the protection of prime agricultural land. For summer, the two groups of crops are 'Coarse-grain & Pulse' and 'Cotton'. For winter, the two groups of crops are 'Cereal' and 'Pulse'. Non-crop groups, present in both summer and winter, are 'Bare soil' and 'Other' (comprising pastures, woody vegetation, and crop residues). The foundation of the maps is time-series modelling-specifically, applying the concepts of geostatistics in the temporal domain-to model the variation in land-surface phonology within a growing season. The time-series model is flexible, robust, parsimonious, parallelisable, and able to deal with irregular observations. We combined satellite imagery from the Landsat sensors, as well as, when available, Sentinel-2A and MODIS (with the last two reprojected to the 30m grid of Landsat). We applied the time-series model pixel-wise across the study region, to three variables derived from satellite imagery gathered for an individual growing season: enhanced vegetation index, and the sub-pixel proportions of bare-ground and non-photosynthetic vegetation. Weekly-averaged predicted phenological metrics then served as explanatory variables in a tiered, tree-based classification model, for the prediction of the groups. The classification model comprised two expert rules and two random forests. Prior to fitting the classification model, geospatial object-based image analysis was used to change the scale of analysis from individual pixels to (approximately) field-based segments. From the perspective of a map-user, in any given growing season we predicted 'Coarse-grain & Pulse' correctly in 79% of cases; the values for 'Cotton', 'Cereal', and 'Pulse' were 90%, 84%, and 73%, respectively; 'Bare soil' was 72% in summer, and 88% in winter. 'Other' was the most accurately mapped group (98% correct in summer, and 99% correct in winter).

AB Accurate crop distribution maps provide important information for crop censuses, yield monitoring and agricultural insurance assessments. Most existing studies apply low spatial resolution satellite images for crop distribution mapping, even in areas with a fragmented landscape. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provides an alternative imagery source for crop mapping, yet its spectral resolution is usually lower than satellite images. In order to produce more accurate maps without losing any spatial heterogeneity (e.g., the physical boundary of land parcel), this study fuses Sentinel-2A and UAV images to map crop distribution at a finer spatial scale (i.e., land parcel scale) in an experimental site with various cropping patterns in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. Using a random forest algorithm, the original, as well as the fused images, are classified into 10 categories: rice, corn, soybean, buckwheat, other vegetations, greenhouses, bare land, water, roads and houses. In addition, we test the effect of UAV image choice by fusing Sentinel-2A with different UAV images at multiples spatial resolutions: 0.03 m, 0.10 m, 0.50 m, 1.00 m and 3.00 m. Overall, the fused images achieved higher classification accuracies, ranging between 10.58% and 16.39%, than the original images. However, the fused image based on the finest UAV image (i.e., 0.03 m) does not result in the highest accuracy. Instead, the 0.10 m spatial resolution UAV image produced the most accurate map. When the spatial resolution is less than 0.10 m, accuracy decreases gradually as spatial resolution decreases. The results of this paper not only indicate the possibility of combining satellite images and UAV images for land parcel level crop mapping for fragmented landscapes, but it also implies a potential scheme to exploit optimal choice of spatial resolution in fusing UAV images and Sentinel-2A, with little to no adverse side-effects.

AB Remote Sensing is extensively used for crop mapping and management in current era. High resolution multispectral data of every part of earth is available at relatively low cost. Selection of appropriate decision rule and appropriate spectral bands is critical for obtaining accurate classification results. Need to find an accurate decision rule which is less time consuming and needs less resources leads to the performance analysis of different classification algorithms on the basis of their classification accuracy, time consumption, computational requirements, reliability etc. A SPOT 5 image acquired on 2009-07-03 from Barcelona city of Spain located at 41.3833 degrees N, 2.1833 degrees, and the classification algorithms i.e. Maximum Likelihood, Parallelepiped, and Mahalanobis Distance classifiers were used for the classification of the SPOT image. A spatial subset of the original imagery was created with resolution half of the original image. In this research, imagery was first atmospherically corrected using QUAC (Quick Atmospheric Correction). The spectral signature of different land classes were extracted using the spectral profile of each individual land class. The whole imagery was then classified using three Classifiers/Decision Rules i.e. Maximum Likelihood, Mahalanobis Distance and Parallelepiped Classifier. The post classification procedures i.e. clump and sieve were applied to the classified imagery to improve classification results. Maximum Likelihood Classifier outperforms other classifiers i.e. Mahalanobis Distance and Parallelepiped Classifier with Overall Accuracy (OAA) of 99.17 per cent. However these classifiers show good accuracy for classification of some classes of interest for instance the Mahalanobis Classifier outperforms the Maximum Likelihood Classifier in classifying water bodies. Results also show that the band selection is also critical in accurate classification of the imagery. The spectrally subsetted images (NIR band removed) of the same place showed very less classification accuracy than that of the original image

AB In the face of global change, concepts for sustainable land management are increasingly requested, among others to cope with the rapidly increasing energy demand. High resolution land use classifications can contribute spatially explicit information suitable for land use planning. In this study, the coverage of cereal crops was derived for two regions in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate - Germany, as well as in the Alsace - France, by classifying multi-temporal and multi-scale remote sensing data. The presented methodology shall be used as basic input for high resolution bio-energy potential calculations.
   Segmentation of pan-merged 15 m Landsat 7 ETM+ data and pre-classification with CORINE data was applied to derive homogenous objects assumed to approximate the field boundaries of agricultural areas. Seven acquisitions of moderate resolution IRS-P6 AWiFS data (60 m) recorded during the vegetation period of 2007 were used for the subsequent classification of the objects. Multiple classification and regression trees (random forest) were selected as classification algorithm due to their ability to consider non-linear distributions of class values in the feature space. Training and validation was based on a subset of 1724 samplings of the official European land use survey LUCAS (Land Use/ Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey).
   Altogether, the object based approach resulted in an overall accuracy of 74 %. The use of 15 m Landsat for mapping field objects were identified to be one major obstacle caused by the characteristically small agricultural units in Southwest Germany. Improvements were also achieved by correcting the LUCAS samples for location errors.

AB The monitoring of tree species diversity is important for forest or wetland ecosystem service maintenance or resource management. Remote sensing is an efficient alternative to traditional field work to map tree species diversity over large areas. Previous studies have used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral or multispectral remote sensing) for species richness prediction. The recent development of very high spatial resolution (VHR) RGB images has enabled detailed characterization of canopies and forest structures. In this study, we developed a three-step workflow for mapping tree species diversity, the aim of which was to increase knowledge of tree species diversity assessment using deep learning in a tropical wetland (Haizhu Wetland) in South China based on VHR-RGB images and LiDAR points. Firstly, individual trees were detected based on a canopy height model (CHM, derived from LiDAR points) by the local-maxima-based method in the FUSION software (Version 3.70, Seattle, USA). Then, tree species at the individual tree level were identified via a patch-based image input method, which cropped the RGB images into small patches (the individually detected trees) based on the tree apexes detected. Three different deep learning methods (i.e., AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50) were modified to classify the tree species, as they can make good use of the spatial context information. Finally, four diversity indices, namely, the Margalef richness index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the Simpson diversity index, and the Pielou evenness index, were calculated from the fixed subset with a size of 30 x 30 m for assessment. In the classification phase, VGG16 had the best performance, with an overall accuracy of 73.25% for 18 tree species. Based on the classification results, mapping of tree species diversity showed reasonable agreement with field survey data (R-Margalef(2) = 0.4562, root-mean-square error RMSEMargalef = 0.5629; R-Shannon-Wiener(2) = 0.7948, RMSEShannon-Wiener = 0.7202; R-Simpson(2) = 0.7907, RMSESimpson = 0.1038; and R-Pielou(2) = 0.5875, RMSEPielou = 0.3053). While challenges remain for individual tree detection and species classification, the deep-learning-based solution shows potential for mapping tree species diversity.

AB Soil salinization is one of the most serious problems facing soil fertility, crop productivity and sustainable agricultural development in Egypt. The risk of salinization is present, when it leads to toxicity. This study focuses on evaluation of soil salinization at East of Nile Delta to enhance management strategy program using geographical information system (GIS). Two different classifications of salt-affected soils, agronomic classification and Russian classification, were used. Ninety-two surface soil samples were collected at depth 0-30 cm. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) was used for spatial distribution mapping of soil salinity and salinization degree. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the correlation between vegetation density cover and soil salinity levels. The obtained data and salinity maps of the studied area presented that salinity levels according to agronomic classification occupied areas of 60% - non-saline, 15% slightly saline, 13% moderately saline, 2% strongly saline and 10% for extremely saline level. Nevertheless, soil salinization degrees according to Russian classification located 71% - non-saline, 10.5% - slight saline, 9% - moderate saline, 3.8% strongly saline and 5.7% for very strongly saline of the investigated area. On the other hand, the results showed reasonable correlation between NDVI, salinity (EC) and total toxic salts (%) (R-2 = 0.58 with salinity and 0.65 with toxic salts). Finally, precise soil salinity management should consider the concentration of total toxic salts and chemical composition of salts. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI Estimating soybean yield using time series of anomalies in vegetation

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

AB An accurate estimation of soybean yield while the plants are still in the field is highly necessary for industry applications and decision-making policies related to planning. Remote sensing is a powerful tool, due to its spatio-temporal coverage, for developing empirical models to predict and evaluate crop yields at regional and national scales. In Argentina, soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is the most important crop, particularly in Cordoba province the 89% of the sown area and 88% of the production is concentrated in eleven departments. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the performance of three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to explain the anomalies in the soybean yield at department-level in Cordoba, and to develop regressions models for estimate this variable using anomalies of these indices and average crop yield, considering time series of historical records and different sources of data. The results showed that the anomalies of the three vegetation indices fit, with very good precision, the anomalies of soybean yield (Pearson correlation coefficient values from 0.71 to 0.85). The evolution of the NDVI anomalies of mid-season crop development stage, for all periods considered, showed a similar pattern to yield anomalies, particularly differentiating years where droughts or highest soybean yields occurred, independently of data sources used. The regression models estimated soybean yield with NDVI anomalies, obtained prior to harvest, with % RMSE values between 8% and 17%. These simple and versatile models show that using free MODIS data, we can produce reasonable real-time estimates of soybean yield at department-level without previous crop classification.

AB Mapping irrigated areas of a river basin is important in terms of assessing water use and food security. This paper describes an innovative remote sensing based vegetation phenological approach to map irrigated areas and then the differentiates the ground water irrigated areas from the surface water irrigated areas in the Krishna river basin (26,575,200 hectares) in India using MODIS 250 meter every 8-day near continuous time-series data for 2000-2001. Temporal variations in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) pattern obtained in irrigated classes enabled demarcation between: (a) irrigated surface water double crop, (b) irrigated surface water continuous crop, and (c) irrigated ground water mixed crops. The NDVI patterns were found to be more consistent in areas irrigated with ground water due to the continuity of water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release that affected time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the NDVI pattern. Double cropped and light irrigation have relatively late onset of greenness, because they use canal water from reservoirs that drain large catchments and take weeks to fill. Minor irrigation and ground water irrigated areas have early onset of greenness because they drain smaller catchments where aquifers and reservoirs fill more quickly. Vegetation phonologies of 9 distinct classes consisting of Irrigated, rainfed, and other land use classes were also derived using MODIS 250 meter near continuous time-series data that were tested and verified using groundtruth data, Google Earth very high resolution (sub-meter to 4 meter) imagery, and state-level census data. Fuzzy classification accuracies for most classes were around 80% with class mixing mainly between various irrigated classes. The areas estimated from MODIS were highly correlated with census data (R-squared value of 0.86).

AB The combination of high spatial resolution and multi-date satellite imagery offers new opportunities for mapping and monitoring crop types of different agricultural field sizes. However, mapping of crop types at high spatial resolution requires high-quality crop type reference data typically collected from the ground-based surveys to create the maps and/or to assess the map accuracy. The availability of sufficient crop type reference data is limited over large geographic regions because of the time, effort, cost, and accessibility in different parts of the world. To generate large area crop type maps, any existing, but limited reference data must be spatially extended to other regions using appropriate and available non-ground-based sources. There is the potential to classify High Resolution Imagery (HRI) using a phenology-based approach as demonstrated in this paper to generate additional reference data within similar agriculture ecological zones (AEZs) based on the crop characteristics, their types, and their growing season. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate if existing, limited crop type reference data could be extended using this approach. Multi-date, high spatial resolution satellite images were used to spatially extend the limited crop type reference data from one region [called the training region (TR)] to another region [called the test region (TE)] within the same AEZ using a phenology-based Decision Tree (DT) classifier for three different field sizes. The results demonstrate that this phenology-based classification approach can efficiently and effectively extend the limited crop type reference data to other regions in same AEZ for different field sizes.

AB This paper presents the results of a crop type mapping exercise conducted in two study areas in Bulgaria and based on data from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites. A multi-date maximum likelihood classification approach was used in which nine spectral bands from three cloud-free images, well distributed across the growing season, were used. Validation was performed using field data collected as part of the study and data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) dataset. Depending on the validation dataset and the study area, an overall accuracy of 74-95% was achieved after the crop type maps were post-processed by mode filtering. Further increase in accuracy may be obtained if parcel boundaries, as defined in the IACS dataset, are used to aggregate the per-pixel classification to a parcel level.

AB The objectives of this study were to evaluate several spectral indices for estimating soil tillage practices and determining crop residue cover using multispectral and Hyperspectral satellite images. For this purpose, Landsat satellite and EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data were acquired over agricultural fields in central Ohio, near Columbus, in April and May. According to the calculated mean normalized difference tillage index data (NDTI), in the period 2003 to 2014, area of conservation tillage fields increased at a rate of 8.41 %, while no-tillage fields decreased at a rate of 14.45 %. Comparing normalized difference index (NDI) data from 2003 and in 2014 it was determined that a reduction of 10% vegetated areas occurred. Normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NSDVI) values did not evidence significant change over a nearly 10 year period. The best determination of tillage practices was obtained using the cellulose absorption index (CAI) value calculated from Hyperspectral data. By combining information on crop classification with indexes, similar results were obtained for crop distribution over a ten year period.

AB Oil palm is a commercial crop that is important for its food value and as a biofuel, along with its other benefits towards the economy and human health. Currently, Malaysia cultivates approximately 5.64 million ha of oil palm. To date, a study identifying abandoned oil palm areas using satellite images is almost nonexistent. Conventionally, the monitoring of abandoned oil palm lands is tedious and time consuming, especially over large areas. Hence, in this article, the capability of high resolution satellite image via Satellite Pour I'Observation de la Terre-6 (SPOT-6) products to extract abandoned oil palm areas was explored, as was the use of multi-temporal Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery to develop the phenology of abandoned oil palm sites. Homogeneity measures derived through SPOT images played a more important role to identify abandoned oil palm than crop phenology characteristics extracted from high spectral resolution of Landsat images. With the advancement of object-oriented classification, monitoring of abandoned oil palm areas can be done semi-automatically with an accuracy of 92 +/- 1%.

AB Agriculture is essential to the continued existence of human life as they directly depend on it for the production of food. The exponential rise in population calls for a rapid increase in food with the application of technology to reduce the laborious work and maximize production. Precision Agriculture is thought to be solution required to achieve the production rate required. There has been a significant improvement in the area of image processing and data processing which has being a major challenge previously in the practice of precision Agriculture. A database of images is collected through remote sensing, analyzed and a model is developed to determine the right treatment plans for different crop types and different regions. Features of images from vegetation's need to be extracted, classified, segmented and finally fed into the model. Different techniques have been applied to the processes from the use of the neural network, support vector machine, fuzzy logic approach and recently, the most effective approach generating fast and excellent results using the deep learning approach of convolution neural network for image classifications. Deep Convolution neural network is used in plant images recognition and classification to optimize production on a maize plantation. The experimental results on the developed model yielded results with an average accuracy of 99.58%.

ID INFORMATION; AREA
AB Andrews first proposed an equation to visualize the structures within data in 1972. Since then, this equation has been used for data transformation and visualization in a wide variety of fields. However, it has yet to be applied to satellite image data. The effect of unwanted, or impure, pixels occurring in these data varies with their distribution in the image; the effect is greater if impurity pixels are included in a classifier's training set. Andrews' curves enable the interpreter to select outlier or impurity data that can be grouped into a new category for classification. This study overcomes the above-mentioned problem and illustrates the novelty of applying Andrews' plots to satellite image data, and proposes a robust method for classifying the plots that combines Dempster-Shafer theory with fuzzy set theory. In addition, we present an example, obtained from real satellite images, to demonstrate the application of the proposed classification method. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are investigated for different training set sizes and crop types, and are compared with the results of two traditional classification methods. We find that outlier data are easily eliminated by examining Andrews' curves and that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods when considering the classification accuracy.

AB Land cover classification over Yellow River basin, China, by means of simple decision tree classification method using multi-temporal metrics derived from MODIS data is shown in this paper. Since the land cover is one of the input parameters for the hydrological model, the critical feature of classification method is to control the classification result using threshold values. The tentative result shows good correlations with existing digital land use map, thou.-h the small overestimation or underestimation are recognized in several categories and the improvement is necessary in discriminating the single cropped agricultural field from natural grassland. The adjustments of the threshold values established in the decision tree would be done by the aid of higher resolution satellite data.

AB Ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is essential in remote sensing but still full of challenges in the deep learning era. The unbalanced dataset and lack of models are two limitations. Upsampling with data augmentation and ratio batching are proposed to solve the first problem. Upsampling with data augmentation is upsampling by cropping and flipping. It can improve the diversity of the dataset. Ratio batching is realized by choosing the same amount of ships per class in each minibatch. It can make the model converge faster and better. To solve the second problem, a new loss function and convolutional neural network model are proposed. The new loss function can maximize the intraclass compactness and interclass separation simultaneously. Dense residual network has two submodules. One is the identity mapping through elementwise summation to reuse old features. The other is dense connection through concatenation to exploit new features. The designed architecture is suitable for the task of SAR ship classification. We use the confusion matrix and accuracy averaged on classes to measure the performance. From the experiments, we can find that the proposed ideas have excellent performance especially on the rare classes. (C) 2018 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Rice crop is one of the most important agricultural products in Asia. It is necessary to monitor rice in wide area for the food control and the adjustment of food. This study focuses on the validation for monitoring of rice crop growth and extraction of rice-planted area using the German TerraSAR-X (X-band), ENVISAT-1/ASAR (C-band) and ALOS/PALSAR (L-band). TerraSAR-X is an advanced satellite which is able to observe 1m resolution with single polarization (HH or VV) or 2m resolution with dual polarization (HH/VV) in SpotLight mode. Also ASAR and PALSAR have single and dual polarization mode. Multi-temporal SAR data of each satellite are processed and analyzed to investigate temporal change of SAR backscattering coefficient of rice-planted area during the rice growing cycle with different wavelength, polarization and resolution in the test site of Hiroshima, Japan. Ground truth data are measured simultaneously with satellite observation such as height of plant, vegetation cover and Leaf Area Index (LAI) corresponding to SAR observation, and also the correlation between SAR backscattering coefficient and those parameters of rice crop growing were analyzed. SAR backscatter shows the significant change in early stage of rice growing cycle. Therefore, rice-planted area extraction is conducted with multi-temporal SAR data based on a classification technique using maximum likelihood method (MLC). In conclusion, rice crop growth and rice-planted area extraction can be successfully monitored using multi-temporal and multi-wavelength SAR data.

AB This paper presents the analysis of IRS LISS III satellite image based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for extracting the crop pattern of rabi season of Kangsabati commanded area located at Bankura district of West Bengal, India. NDVI was calculated through creation of FCC (False Colour Composite) followed by supervised classification by applying ground truth data obtained after physical survey on three districts, covered under Kangsabati reservoir commanded area. Final crop map is generated to extract different crop classes from which crop sown in rabi season is estimated. It has been found that potato crop is sown on much more area than rice. Finally, accuracy is checked, and 87% accuracy was achieved after successful identification of crop. This study suggest that this approach will be effective with an acceptable accuracy for crop map generation to classify the different crops and thereby calculate the actual crop water demand of commanded area of Kangsabati reservoir and thereby evaluate the performance of the canal system in near future.

AB In southern Laos, water stored in farm ponds is largely underutilised as it is perceived to be unfit for human consumption; subsequently, groundwater is the preferred source for domestic and agricultural consumption. For the first time, this paper presents the results of a study designed to quantify the total pond water volume within the landscape via remote-sensing methods in two districts in Champasak province that could be used to improve rural household cash income through the expansion of market-oriented dry season crop production. Water bodies were delineated via simple classification of RapidEye data using the Normalised Difference Water Index and a sub-classification was performed to distinguish between ponds and the streamflow network. Final estimates of total pond volume in Sukhuma and Phonthong districts were similar to 2.30 x 10(6) m(3) and 3.55 x 10(6) m(3), respectively; and the average pond volume across both districts was similar to 1987 m(3). Sensitivity analysis of the potential gross value of farm ponds for irrigation of dry season, vegetable production typical of market-oriented smallholder activities in the area indicated that substantial gross economic gains could be made from better use and management of these resources.

AB Classification of crops and other land cover types is an important application of both optical/infrared and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data. It is already an import application of present satellite systems, as it will be for planned missions, such as the Sentinels. A multitemporal data set from the Danish airborne polarimetric EMISAR has been used to assess the performance of different polarization modes for crop classification. Both C-and L-band SAR data were acquired simultaneously over the Foulum agricultural test site in Denmark on a monthly basis during the growing season. Single-and dual-polarization and fully polarimetric data have been used in the analysis. The best result for a single-frequency system was a 20%-22% classification error, and the results for C-band and for L-band were very similar. The best result was obtained at C-band using the VVXP polarization combination (the dual-polarization mode, where the VV-channel and the cross-polarized channel have been combined) and at L-band using the fully polarimetric mode with the Hoekman and Vissers classifier. The best result for the combination of the C- and L-bands was 16%. In this case also, the VVXP polarization combination performed best. There is a trade-off between the polarimetric information and the multitemporal information, where the best overall results are obtained using the multitemporal information.

AB Precision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy that analyzes the spatial and temporal variability of agricultural fields using information and communication technologies with the aim to optimize profitability, sustainability, and protection of agro-ecological services. In the context of PA, this research evaluated the reliability of multispectral (MS) imagery collected at different spatial resolutions by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 satellite platforms in monitoring onion crops over three different dates. The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was used for monitoring the vigor of the study field. Next, the vigor maps from the two satellite platforms with those derived from UAV were compared by statistical analysis in order to evaluate the contribution made by each platform for monitoring onion crops. Besides, the two coverage's classes of the field, bare soil and onions, were spatially identified using geographical object-based image classification (GEOBIA), and their spectral contribution was analyzed comparing the SAVI calculated considering only crop pixels (i.e., SAVI onions) and that calculated considering only bare soil pixels (i.e., SAVI soil) with the SAVI from the three platforms. The results showed that satellite imagery, coherent and correlated with UAV images, could be useful to assess the general conditions of the field while UAV permits to discriminate localized circumscribed areas that the lowest resolution of satellites missed, where there are conditions of inhomogeneity in the field, determined by abiotic or biotic stresses.

AB Soil erosion associated with non-point source pollution is viewed as a process of land degradation in many terrestrial environments. Careful monitoring and assessment of land use variations with different temporal and spatial scales would reveal a fluctuating interface, punctuated by changes in rainfall and runoff, movement of people, perturbation from environmental disasters, and shifts in agricultural activities and cropping patterns. The use of multi-temporal remote sensing images in support of environmental modeling analysis in a geographic information system (GIS) environment leading to identification of a variety of long-term interactions between land, resources, and the built environment has been a highly promising approach in recent years. This paper started with a series of supervised land use classifications, using SPOT satellite imagery as a means, in the Kao-Ping River Basin, South Taiwan. Then, it was designed to differentiate the variations of eight land use patterns in the past decade, including orchard, farmland, sugarcane field, forest, grassland, barren, community, and water body. Final accuracy was confirmed based on interpretation of available aerial photographs and global positioning system (GPS) measurements. Finally, a numerical simulation model (General Watershed Loading Function, GWLF) was used to relate soil erosion to nonpoint source pollution impacts in the coupled land and river water systems. Research findings indicate that while the decadal increase in orchards poses a significant threat to water quality, the continual decrease in forested land exhibits a potential impact on water quality management. Non-point source pollution, contributing to part of the downstream water quality deterioration of the Kao-Ping River system in the last decade, has resulted in an irreversible impact on land integrity from a long-term perspective.

AB India's rapid population and economic growth leads to fast changing land use and management practices that have a major impact on the environment. Therefore, this study assesses spatio-temporal dynamics of land use and cropping frequencies using moderate resolution spaceborne data (Landsat 7 and LISS III). Based on a hierarchical knowledge-based classification approach, multi-temporal satellite data from the years 2000/2001 and 2010/2011 have been used to derive land use and cropping frequency maps. The approach adopted in this study resulted in a satisfactory classification quality as indicated by overall accuracies > 90% for the individual classifications. A reduced land use pressure on mountainous areas was found, indicated by an increasing development of forests within the transition zones between cultivated land and steep slopes. Furthermore, an increase of tree plantations points to a shift from drought vulnerable plants to less risk prone perennial plants. We found a higher cropping frequency in 2010/11 related to both inter-annual precipitation differences over the course of the rainy season and long-term socio-economic changes. While low yield areas are left for natural succession or switched to tree plantations, the cultivation of high yield areas was intensified.

AB Perennial commodity crops, such as coffee, often play a large role globally in agricultural markets and supply chains and locally in livelihoods, poverty reduction, and biodiversity. Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical "coffee belt," hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural infor-mation and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences.

AB Crop infestation with root-knot nematodes (RKN) and water deficiency lead to similar visible symptoms in the plant canopy. Identification of biotic or abiotic stress origin is therefore a problem, and currently the only reliable methods for determination of RKN infestation are invasive and applicable only for point-searches. In this study the applicability of hyperspectral remote sensing for early identification of drought stress and RKN infestations in tomato plants was tested. A four-stage image and data management pipeline was established: (1) image acquisition, (2) data extraction, (3) pre-processing, and (4) processing.
   This pipeline reduces atmospheric impacts, facilitates data extraction (by using specially designed spectral libraries and supervised classification procedures), diminishes the impact of viewing geometry, and emphasized small spectral variations not apparent in the raw data.
   By combining partial least squares - discriminant analysis and support vector machines with time series analysis, we achieved up to 100% classification success when determining watering regime and infestation, and their severity.
   This pipeline could be at least partially automated, thus facilitating high throughput identification of stress origin in plants. Furthermore, the same pipeline could be applied to hyperspectral phenotyping procedures, which are gaining importance in breeding programs. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Satellite image time series (SITS) provide spectral-temporal features that describe phenological changes in vegetation over the growing season, which is expected to facilitate the classification of crop types. While most SITS-based crop type classifications were focused on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) temporal profiles, less attention has been paid to using the complete image spectral resolution of the time series. In this work we assessed different approaches to SITS-based classification of four major fruit-tree crops in the Maipo Valley, central Chile, during the 2013-14 growing season. We compared four feature sets from a time series comprised of eight cloud-free Landsat-8 images: the full-band SITS, the NDVI and NDWI (normalized difference water index) temporal profiles, and an image stack with all the feature sets combined. State-of-the-art classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, LDA; random forest; and support vector machine) were applied on each feature set at different training sample sizes (N = 100, 200, 400, 800 and 2291 fields), and classification results were assessed by cross-validation of the misclassification error rate (MER). For all the feature sets overall results were good (MERs <= 0.21) although substantially improved classification accuracies were achieved when the full-band SITS was employed (MER 0.14-0.05). Classifications applied on the NDVI temporal profile consistently had the worst performance. For a sample size of 200 fields, LDA using the full-band SITS of image dates 1, 3, 6 and 8 produced the best tradeoff between the number of images and classification accuracy (MER = 0.06), being the green, red, blue and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands of image date 1 (acquired at the early greenup stage) the most relevant for crop type discrimination. Our results show the importance of considering the complete image spectral resolution for SITS-based crop type classifications as the commonly used NDVI temporal profile and their red and near infrared bands were not found the most significant to discriminate the crop types of interest. Furthermore, in light of the good results obtained, the methodology used here might be transferred to similar agricultural lands cultivated with the same crop types, thus providing a reliable and relatively efficient methodology for creating and updating crop inventories.

AB Accurate measurements of agricultural land cover are important for monitoring global food security, economic stability, and environmental conditions. Since significant portions of global agricultural land are frequently cloud covered, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been shown to be a reliable form of gathering crop measurements, even in regions where acquiring clear optical imagery is challenging. In this work, repeat coverage from the C-band Sentinel-1 satellite over a portion of North Dakota is used to classify individual agricultural land-cover types. In this approach the times series forms the basis of a classification algorithm, where individual pixels are compared against a model of average crop backscatter response and classified as the crop with the least difference from the model. Multiple variations on the analysis are run to test the influence of polarization, iterations in model building, number of training fields, and validation input on the classification accuracy. It is shown that both VV and VH polarizations individually and combined are routinely able to produce overall accuracies above 90% when using multiple iterations in model building. These results show the potential for SAR-based agricultural land cover classifications built from comprehensive time series data.

AB An algorithm of generic classification is described based on the form of the spectral signature of 12 objects present on the images of the ETM+ sensor of Landsat 7 satellite. The algorithm is a decision tree that does not require training areas to carry out the classification, since it is backed up by Boolean operations, which identify the objects by the characteristic forms of their spectral signature. The algorithm has been successfully used in estimations of crop areas and in the identification of water bodies in images that cover almost all Mexico.

AB The purpose of this investigation is to apply 3-D wavelet denoising to resolve spatial, as well as spectral, data in Landsat images. The use of multiple thresholds will be extended to achieve image classification. Wavelet denoising has been shown to be effective for noise reduction in 1-D signals and 2-D images. 3-D wavelet transforms have the potential for multiresolution surface reconstruction from volume data. 3-D wavelet denoising will be applied to spatial (2-D) and spectral (1-D) data. Landsat images were produced from a multispectral scanner on Landsat satellites. Wavelet have been used to achieve some level of image classification. Finer classification can be achieved in agricultural areas because of temporal difference between crops and because of spectral differences in transmission spectra. Varying threshold should achieve image classification based on spectral difference between crops. 3-D wavelet data processing is expected to offer greater potential for improving resolution of volume data. Use of multithreshold for spectral resolution might be usefully applied to images generated by nonvisible wavelengths: radar, IR and laser radar.

AB In this article, a vegetation classification hypothesis based on plant biochemical composition is presented. The basic idea of this hypothesis is that the vegetation species/crops have their own biochemical composition characteristics, which are separable from each other for those co-existing species at a specific region. Therefore, vegetation species can be classified based on the biochemical composition characteristics, which can be retrieved from hyperspectral remote-sensing data. In order to test this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted in north-western China. Field data on the biochemical compositions and spectral responses of different plants and an Earth-observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion image were simultaneously collected. After analysing the relationship between biochemical composition and spectral data collected from Hyperion, the vegetation biochemical compositions were estimated using sample biochemical data and bands of Hyperion data. The vegetation classification was completed using the biochemical content classifier (BCC) and maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC) with all Hyperion bands (MLC_ A) and selected bands (MLC_ S), which were used for estimating considered biochemical contents (cellulose and carotenoid). The overall classification accuracy of the BCC (95.2%) was as good as MLC_ S (95.2%) and better than MLC_ A (91.1%), as was the kappa value (BCC 92.849%, MLC_ S 92.845%, MLC_ A 86.637%), suggesting that the BCC was a feasible classification method. The biochemical-based classification method has higher vegetation classification accuracy and execution speed, reduces data dimension and redundancy and needs only a few spectral bands to retrieve biochemical contents instead of using all of the spectral bands. It is an effective method to classify vegetation based on plant biochemical composition characteristics.

AB The rice-cropping system in southern China experienced a major change in the past few decades. Rice-cropping systems not only affect the comprehensive utilization intensity of agricultural resources, food security, and the ecological environment but also reveal the conditions of the agricultural policy, regional economy, and rural labor force. Consequently, accurate detection of rice-cropping systems is an essential issue. We present a method for classifying rice-cropping systems using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) that involves extracting deep features of spatial and spectral trajectories. The study area is a major rice-growing region located in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Multitemporal Sentinel-2 satellite images were collected to obtain time series curves of texture (spatial trajectories) and the first derivative vegetation index (spectral trajectories) as inputs of the hierarchical classification model. The classification results of land cover and rice-cropping systems were acquired using the pretrained CNN, and the method achieved overall accuracy of 94.78% and 94.87%, respectively. This method was then compared with the support vector machine (SVM). The accuracy of rice-cropping systems using the pretrained CNN was 7.11% higher than that of the SVM. The adaptability of the model was also investigated using the time series curve in another year with relatively insufficient data. The model obtained satisfactory performance with the overall accuracy of land cover types and rice-cropping systems of 93.52% and 93.23%, respectively. We suggest that the pretrained CNN can improve the accuracy of rice-cropping system mapping by extracting deep features of spatial and spectral trajectories during the rice growth cycle and such method may be applied in other fine crop classifications.

AB Glyphosate and paraquat herbicide drift injury to crops may substantially reduce growth or yield. Determining the type and degree of injury is of importance to a producer. This research was conducted to determine whether remote sensing could be used to identify and quantify herbicide injury to crops. Soybean and corn plants were grown in 3.8-L pots to the five- to seven-leaf stage, at which time, applications of nonselective herbicides were made. Visual injury estimates were made, and hyperspectral reflectance data were recorded 1, 4, and 7 d after application (DAA). Several analysis techniques including multiple indices, signature amplitude (SA) with spectral bands as features, and wavelet analysis were used to distinguish between herbicide-treated and nontreated plants. Classification accuracy using SA analysis of paraquat injury on soybean was better than 75% for both 1/2- and 1/8X rates at 1, 4, and 7 DAA. Classification accuracy of paraquat injury on corn was better than 72% for the 1/2X rate at 1, 4, and 7 DAA. These data suggest that hyperspectral reflectance may be used to distinguish between healthy plants and injured plants to which herbicides have been applied; however, the classification accuracies remained at 75% or higher only when the higher rates of herbicide were applied. Applications of a 1/2X rate of glyphosate produced 55 to 81% soybean injury and 20 to 50% corn injury 4 and 7 DAA, respectively. However, using SA analysis, the moderately injured plants were indistinguishable from the uninjured controls, as represented by the low classification accuracies at the 1/8-, 1/32-, and 1/64X rates. The most promising technique for identifying drift injury was wavelet analysis, which successfully distinguished between corn plants treated with either the 1/8- or the 1/2X rates of paraquat compared with the nontreated corn plants better than 92% 1, 4, and 7 DAA. These analysis techniques, once tested and validated on field scale data, may help determine the extent and the degree of herbicide drift for making appropriate and, more importantly, timely management decisions.

AB In this study, the coefficient of variation (CV) is introduced as a unitless statistical measurement for the classification of croplands using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. As a measurement of change, the CV is able to capture changing backscatter responses caused by cycles of planting, growing, and harvesting, and thus is able to differentiate these areas from a more static forest or urban area. Pixels with CV values above a given threshold are classified as crops, and below the threshold are non-crops. This paper uses cross-polarized L-band SAR data from the ALOS PALSAR satellite to classify eleven regions across the United States, covering a wide range of major crops and climates. Two separate sets of classification were done, with the first targeting the optimum classification thresholds for each dataset, and the second using a generalized threshold for all datasets to simulate a large-scale operationalized situation. Overall accuracies for the first phase of classification ranged from 66%-81%, and 62%-84% for the second phase. Visual inspection of the results shows numerous possibilities for improving the classifications while still using the same classification method, including increasing the number and temporal frequency of input images in order to better capture phenological events and mitigate the effects of major precipitation events, as well as more accurate ground truth data. These improvements would make the CV method a viable tool for monitoring agriculture throughout the year on a global scale.

AB This article presents a monitoring of land cover/use by satellite images over an 11-year period (2006-2016), over a study site located in southwestern France near Toulouse. Time series of optical data are acquired by Spot and Landsat, which deliver images in multispectral mode with high spatial resolution (10-30 m). The detection of the different types of land cover/use (crops, grasslands, water, urban and wood) is produced every year. It is based on national reference geographical data and a random forest algorithm. The classifications arc characterized by a high level of performance, with an average kappa of 0,83 (OA - 0.85). The performance by land cover/use type is related to their representativeness, dates and number of acquisitions, and the resolution of satellite images. The results allow analyzing the evolution of the three main crops (wheat, sunflower and corn).

AB The objectives of this study were to determine onion water requirements with a sprinkler irrigation system, the most usual irrigation method in Spain. A weighing lysimeter was used to measure single (Kc) and dual (Kcb + Ke) crop coefficient curves and obtain the relationship between Kc-ground cover (GC) and Kcb-GC. Experimental work was carried out in 2005 at "Las Tiesas" farm, located in Albacete (Central Spain). To determine actual onion evapotranspiration (ETc), we used a weighing lysimeter with continuous electronic data recording. Daily measured ETc values obtained by the lysimeter were compared to calculated ETc values obtained through the standard FAD methodology [Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., 1998. Crop evapotranspiration. Guidelines for computing crop water requirements. FAO Irrig. and Drain. Paper 56. Rome, Italy]. Seasonal evapotranspiration measured in the lysimeter (893.34 mm) was higher than the seasonal ETc calculated by FAO-56 method (832.90 mm). The percentage of GC was found through the supervised classification technique of digital photographic images with the maximum probability algorithm [Calera, A., Martinez, C., Melia, J., 2001. A procedure for obtaining green plant cover: relation to NDVI in a case study for barley. Int. J. Remote Sensing, 22, 3357-3362]. The values derived from lysimetric measurements are Kc ini: 0.65. Kc mid: 1.20 and Kc end: 0.75, similar to values given in FAO-56. Lysimetric measurements showed that the evaporative component was high during the growing season, due to the high frequency of irrigation and the fact that the onion crop does not completely cover the ground; maximum GC was 72%. Therefore, the dual crop coefficient was calculated, which allowed differentiation between crop transpiration (basal crop coefficient, Kcb) and evaporation from the soil (evaporation coefficient, Ke). With the aim of facilitating extrapolation of the results to other areas, Kc and Kcb were linearly correlated to fractional GC. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate determination of phenological information of crops is essential for field management and decision-making. Remote sensing time-series data are widely used for extracting phenological phases. Existing methods mainly extract phenological phases directly from individual remote sensing time-series, which are easily affected by clouds, noise, and mixed pixels. This paper proposes a novel method of phenological phase extraction based on the time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm using MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 5-day time-series data with a spatial resolution of 500 m. Firstly, based on the phenological differences between winter wheat and other land cover types, winter wheat distribution is extracted using the TWDTW classification method, and the results show that the overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient reach 94.74% and 0.90, respectively. Then, we extract the pure winter-wheat pixels using a method based on the coefficient of variation, and use these pixels to generate the average phenological curve. Next, the difference between each winter-wheat phenological curve and the average winter-wheat phenological curve is quantitatively calculated using the TWDTW algorithm. Finally, the key phenological phases of winter wheat in the study area, namely, the green-up date (GUD), heading date (HD), and maturity date (MD), are determined. The results show that the phenological phase extraction using the TWDTW algorithm has high accuracy. By verification using phenological station data from the Meteorological Data Sharing Service System of China, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the GUD, HD, and MD are found to be 9.76, 5.72, and 6.98 days, respectively. Additionally, the method proposed in this article is shown to have a better extraction performance compared with several other methods. Furthermore, it is shown that, in Hebei Province, the GUD, HD, and MD are mainly affected by latitude and accumulated temperature. As the latitude increases from south to north, the GUD, HD, and MD are delayed, and for each 1 degrees increment in latitude, the GUD, HD, and MD are delayed by 4.84, 5.79, and 6.61 days, respectively. The higher the accumulated temperature, the earlier the phenological phases occur. However, latitude and accumulated temperature have little effect on the length of the phenological phases. Additionally, the lengths of time between GUD and HD, HD and MD, and GUD and MD are stable at 46, 41, and 87 days, respectively. Overall, the proposed TWDTW method can accurately determine the key phenological phases of winter wheat at a regional scale using remote sensing time-series data.

AB Significant advances in weed mapping from unmanned aerial platforms have been achieved in recent years. The detection of weed location has made possible the generation of site specific weed treatments to reduce the use of herbicides according to weed cover maps. However, the characterization of weed infestations should not be limited to the location of weed stands, but should also be able to distinguish the types of weeds to allow the best possible choice of herbicide treatment to be applied. A first step in this direction should be the discrimination between broad-leaved (dicotyledonous) and grass (monocotyledonous) weeds. Considering the advances in weed detection based on images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles, and the ability of neural networks to solve hard classification problems in remote sensing, these technologies have been merged in this study with the aim of exploring their potential for broadleaf and grass weed detection in wide-row herbaceous crops such as sunflower and cotton. Overall accuracies of around 80% were obtained in both crops, with user accuracy for broad-leaved and grass weeds around 75% and 65%, respectively. These results confirm the potential of the presented combination of technologies for improving the characterization of different weed infestations, which would allow the generation of timely and adequate herbicide treatment maps according to groups of weeds.

SO PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Classification of digital satellite images involves a process similar to classification problems in artificial intelligence.  In a knowledge-based classification, ancillary data and knowledge are combined with spectral information.  A method of knowledge-based classification based on temporal relationships between classes is introduced.  Knowledge about crop rotations is represented by means of state transition matrices.  Spectral image information, information stored in a geographic information system, and knowledge as represented in a matrix are combined in a Bayesian maximum-likelihood classification.  This method is elaborated for a test area in The Netherlands.  Depending on the spectral separation of the classes and the level of detail of the transition matrices, the overall accuracy of the classification increased by 4 percent to 20 percent with respect to the result based on only spectral information.

AB Background: Monitoring the changing pattern of vegetation across diverse landscapes through remote sensing is instrumental in understanding the interactions of human activities and the ecological environment. Land use pattern in the state of Himachal Pradesh in the Indian Western Himalayas has been undergoing rapid modifications due to changing cropping patterns, rising anthropogenic pressure on forests and government policies. We studied land use change in Solan Forest Division of Himachal Pradesh to assess species wise area changes in the forests of the region.
   Methods: The supervised classification (Maximum likelihood) on two dates of IRS (LISS III) satellite data was performed to assess land use change over the period 1998-2010.
   Results: Seven land use categories were identified namely, chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) forest, broadleaved forest, bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) forest, ban oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) forest, khair (Acacia catechu) forest, culturable blank and cultivation. The area under chir pine, cultivation and khair forests increased by 191 ha (4.55 %), 129 ha (13.81 %) and 77 ha (23.40 %), whereas the area under ban oak, broadleaved, culturable blank and bamboo decreased by 181 ha (16.58 %), 152 ha (6.30 %), 71 ha (2.72 %) and 7 ha (0.47 %), respectively.
   Conclusions: The study revealed a decrease in the area under forest and culturable blank categories and a simultaneous increase in the area under cultivation primarily due to the large scale introduction of horticultural cash crops in the state. The composition of forests also exhibited some major changes, with an increase in the area of commercially important monoculture plantation species such as pine and khair, and a decline in the area of oak, broadleaved and bamboo which are facing a high anthropogenic pressure in meeting the livelihood demands of forest dependent communities. In time deforestation, forest degradation and ecological imbalances due to the changing forest species composition may inflict irreversible damages upon unstable and fragile mountain zones such as the Indian Himalayas. The associated common property externalities involved at local, regional and global scales, necessitate the monitoring of land use dynamics across forested landscapes in developing future strategies and policies concerning agricultural diversification, natural forest conservation and monoculture tree plantations.

AB Mung bean (Vigna radiata) plays an important role providing protein in the rice-based diet of the people in Bangladesh. In the coastal division of Barisal, our study area, the average farm size is less than 0.5 ha and individual fields measure about 0.10 ha. The availability of free Sentinel-2 optical satellite data acquired at a 10 m ground sampling distance (GSD) may offer an opportunity to generate crop area estimates in smallholder farming settings in South Asia. We combined different sources of in situ data, such as aerial photographs taken from a low flying manned aircraft, data collected on the ground, and data derived from satellite images to create a data set for a segment based classification of mung bean. User's accuracy for mung bean was 0.98 and producer's accuracy was 0.99. Hence, the accuracy metrics indicate that the random tree classifier was able to identify mung bean based on 10 m GSD data, despite the small size of individual fields. We estimated the mung bean area for 2019 at 109,416 ha, which is about 40% lower than the Department of Agricultural Extension estimates (183,480 ha), but more than four times higher than the 2019 data reported by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (26,612 ha). Further analysis revealed that crop production tends to be clustered in the landscape by crop type. After merging adjacent segments by crop type, the following average cluster sizes resulted: 1.62 ha for mung bean, 0.74 ha for rice (Oryza sativa), 0.68 ha for weedy fallow and 0.40 ha for a category of other crops. This explains why 10 m GSD satellite data can be used for the identification of predominant crops grown in specific regions of South Asia.

AB Irrigation is the greatest human interference with the terrestrial water cycle. Detailed knowledge on irrigation is required to better manage water resources and to increase water use efficiency (WUE). This study applies a framework to quantify net irrigation at monthly timescale at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) providing high spatial and temporal detail for regional water resources management. The study is conducted in the Haihe River Basin (HRB) in China encompassing the North China Plain (NCP), a global hot spot of groundwater depletion. Net irrigation is estimated based on the systematic evapotranspiration (ET) residuals between a remote sensing-based model and a hydrologic model that does not include an irrigation scheme. The results suggest an average annual net irrigation of 126 mm yr(-1) (15.2 km(3) yr(-1)) for NCP and 108 mm yr(-1) (18.6 km(3) yr(-1)) for HRB. It is found that net irrigation can be estimated with higher fidelity for winter crops than for summer crops. The simulated water balance for NCP is evaluated with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, and the net irrigation estimates can close the water balance gap. Annual winter wheat classifications reveal an increasing crop area with a trend of 2,200 km(2) yr(-1). This trend is not accompanied by a likewise increasing trend in irrigation water use, which suggests an increased WUE in the NCP, which is further supported by net primary productivity data. The proposed framework has potential to be transferred to other regions and support decision makers to support sustainable water management.

AB Seasonal evapotranspiration is an essential measure to model crop growth and hydrological balances particularly for irrigation agriculture in semi-arid environments. Hydrological models traditionally integrate single-spot measurements of meteorological stations to estimate potential evapotranspiration. During the last years, the application of thermal remote sensing data in combination with meteorological data of soil-vegetation-atmosphere models facilitated the estimation of actual evapotranspiration on a large scale. This study employed multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to apply the Surface Energy Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model to the heterogeneous environment of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan. Further meteorological data was used to extrapolate actual evapotranspiration to seasonal actual evapotranspiration. The validation of the modeled actual evapotranspiration showed acceptable accuracy when compared to the limited point-based ground truth data. The integration of a rule-based land use classification with higher spatial resolution revealed the necessity to include sub-pixel knowledge of land use distribution to interpret the modeling results. First evaluations of the water distribution and consumption situation were achieved by interpretation of modeled seasonal actual evapotranspiration with hydrological GIS information.

AB The main aim of this paper was to explore the potential of SAR data, in combination with optical remote sensing data, in identifying inland fresh water wetland from crop, especially rice paddy. The test area is a part of Hongze Lake, the fourth biggest fresh water lake in China. It is one of important wetlands for migratory birds in China. Due to unreasonable exploitation of wetland resources, the lake is facing a great loss of wetland. In Hongze lake watershed, Jiangsu Provincial Sihong Hongze Lake wetland ecological reserve was established for the preserve of wetland ecosystem and rare species in the watershed. In the processing of the dataset, clustering algorithm ISODATA was employed firstly to generate initial classification results for sample selection. Then, 1500 samples were taken in total by using stratified random sampling. These samples were superimposed on the screen on top of rectified aerial images. The land cover class at each point was determined based on field investigation and visual interpretation. 900 samples of them were for training and the other for the assessment of classification accuracy. Attributes of samples such as the digital number values of six bands of ETM+( TM1-5, 7), texture, DEM and 4 components of principal components analysis of six bands of ETM + data, were fed into the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm for the generation of knowledge rules. Because the training observations were evenly distributed among classes, the class assignment at each terminal node was determined by the majority of per-class observations at that node. Then, decision tree classifier was applied to the imagery of ETM+ for the classification of landuse/cover in the whole study area. RADARSAT SAR C-band was classified into four classes: lowest backscatter, low backscatter, medium and high backscatter. The results from two data sources were combined by using rules. The results showed that the combination of the SAR data and the optical remotely sensed data have achieved the highest classification accuracy (92.3% of total classification accuracy). The results also confirmed the value of classification tree in the identification of fresh water wetland. It was illustrated that radar data was a good complementary data source for the identification of welland.

AB Spectral reflectance and backscattering's of remotely-sensed data presents significant details of different objects on the Earth's surface in numerous applications of space technology. In this study, satellite datasets such as Sentinel-1 i.e. synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets i.e. multispectral data is used in order to effectively classify crop patterns of rainfed regions of India. The study areas have been selected in Jhansi district of Uttar Pradesh, Buldhana district of Maharashtra and Ballari district of Karnataka. These three (3) selected districts contains rainfed and irrigated agricultural lands. In the initial stage baseline map of cropland has been prepared by the following concepts; a baseline map is a map including the total cropland area i.e. Rabi and Kharif and non-cropped area's i.e. man-made (infrastructures + urban), permanent water, permanent vegetation (forest), and other land cover's depending on the area (for instance wetlands, etc.). This is generated by using annual temporal descriptors (TD). In the next, Sentinel-2 MSI high-resolution satellite data has been further used for crop pattern map derived by applying the supervised classification following the machine learning algorithms (MLA) techniques. The accuracy level of crop pattern map of Ballari district is 84.04%, Jhansi district is 89.3%, and of Buldhana district is 83.09%. The total crop land area in Ballari district is 0.582 million ha, with the total crop types covered area is cotton 32%, groundnut 23%, maize 29%, pearl millet 10% and paddy 6%. The total cropland area in Jhansi district is 0.507 million ha, with the total crop types covered area is black gram 65%, paddy 10%, groundnut 17%, and peppermint 8%. The total cropland area in Buldhana district is 0.686 million ha, with the total crop types covered area is cotton 24%, maize 7%, pigeon pea 16%, sorghum 25% and soybean 28%, respectively.

AB Tillage practices, which have direct impacts on soil and water quality, have changed dramatically during the past several decades. Tillage information is one of the important inputs for environmental modeling, but the availability of this information is still limited spatially and temporally. Previous studies have encountered difficulties in defining reliable correlations between crop residue cover (CRC) and Landsat-based tillage indices because they neglected the significance of the timing of tillage implementation. This study explores relationships between temporal changes of agricultural surfaces and the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) in Central Indiana. We found that minimum NDTI (minNDTI) values extracted from multi-temporal NDTI profiles reliably indicate the surface status when tillage or planting occurred. Simple linear regression reveals a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89 between CRC and minNDTI for calibration. In addition, a percentage change (PC) method was tested for classifying CRC into three categories (CRC<30%; 30%<CRC<70%; CRC> 70%). Both the minNDTI and PC methods resulted in overall classification accuracies of >90%, producer's accuracies of 83-100%, and user's accuracies of 75-100%. Our results indicated that both Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery are capable of mapping CRC, however, multi-temporal Landsat imagery is required. To establish a capability for crop residue mapping, designers of future remote sensing platforms should consider increasing temporal resolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ACCESSIBILITY
AB Urban green is indispensable from an urban ecological and social point of view and fulfils important functions such as dust binding, temperature reduction, wind damping or groundwater recharge. Especially for bioclimatic modeling, knowledge of size, structure and green volume of the urban vegetation is essential. Manual mapping of vegetation structures is timeconsuming and cost-intensive and can only ever be carried out in locally limited study areas. Active and passive remote sensing technologies in combination with automated methods for information extraction offer the opportunity to record the green structure in urban areas differentiated according to vegetation types. The new globally and freely available data provided by the European Copernicus Program raises the question whether these data are suitable for mapping and quantifying the urban green structure, including an accuracy estimation. Previous studies on the usability of Sentinel-2 data for vegetation analysis were essentially limited to crop and tree species classification in open space. The approach presented here thus considers for the first time the application of this data in a purely urban environment. Here we present a modeling approach based on multiple regression models. A Sentinel-2A scene from July 4, 2015 covering the greater Dresden area served as the input data set. After atmospheric correction of the satellite image scene 10 spectral channels were available. A high-resolution vegetation cover model with a grid width of 50 cm was available as a reference data set for the entire study area (City of Dresden, Germany). This takes into account the vegetation classes deciduous trees, conifers, shrubs, low (grassy) vegetation and arable land. Thus the area share of these vegetation types could be determined aggregated for each pixel of the satellite image scene. In addition, vegetation indices (NDVI and others) were calculated using suitable channels. For the prediction of each vegetation class, estimation equations were drawn up and evaluated with regard to their quality. Especially for deciduous and coniferous trees, satisfactory model quality values could be obtained, so that the green component prediction in these cases represents a useful basis for the determination of the green structure at the building block level in urban areas.

AB Hyperspectral face recognition plays an important role in remote sensing. However, it faces many challenges such as difficulty in data acquisition, low signal to noise ratio (SNR), and high dimensionality. In this paper, we develop a novel method for hyperspectral face recognition by extracting histogram of oriented features (HOG) and using collaborate representation-based classifier (CRC) to classify unknown face data cubes. To improve overall classification rates, we also implement noise reduction in hyperspectral face data cubes. We also crop the face images by a bounding box and use this bounding box image to classify the testing faces. Experiments show that our new method outperforms several existing methods for both the PolyU-HSFD dataset and the CMU-HSFD dataset for hyperspectral face recognition. The contribution of this paper is the following: We introduce the MNF-based denoising method in this paper, which is new to the best of our knowledge. We also combine it with HOG features and CRC classifier so that better recognition rate can be achieved.

AB One of the most important decisions made by farmers every year involves land allocation to different crops. Accurate information on crop sequences over large areas is a key prerequisite to address social concerns as soybean monoculture, to map good agronomic practices and to assess farmers' adaptive capacity among others. Here we aimed to characterize crop sequences and describe the crop rotation patterns in an area of the Rolling Pampas in Argentina. We performed annual supervised classifications for the 2010/2011 to 2016/2017 growing seasons using high resolution satellite images and in situ data. Classification's accuracies were always higher than 85%. Analysis of crop sequences showed that the most common practice was alternating periods of continuous planting of early soybean with periods where maize and/or wheat were included in the rotation. In addition, during the period analyzed nearly 10% of the study area exhibited continuous soybean monoculture, and 6% of the area showed a strict crop rotation of maize, soybean, and wheat-soybean double crop. Changes in early soybean planted area were significantly associated (p < 0.1) to its previous year's international price, and were probably affected by political economy regulations. The inclusion of maize or wheat in the rotation was more frequently observed at larger cadastral units, while soybean monoculture was more frequent in smaller cadastral units. This suggests that farmers' capitalization may be associated to different crop rotation decisions through a different long term planning capacity.

AB The remote sensing and geoprocessing are important geotechnologies in support of the survey data of agriculture, enabling studies and understanding of environmental relations in which a particular culture is insert. The objective of this work was to relate the physical variables, such as altimetry, slope and soil type with the coffee agrosystems in Umuarama-PR through the geotechnologies. The image of the LANDSAT 5/TM (Thematic Mapper) dated in 02/07/2007 and the software SPRING 4.3.3 were used for the image processing. The bands 3, 4 and 5 of the sensor TM were restored, which resulted in images of 15m spatial resolution and, later, creating the RGB color composition, which was used to identify the coffee crops through visual interpretation. For the relief map study, the data of the SRTM mission were applied, which enabled us to know the altimetry and declivity of the region. The image of the TM sensor enabled the visual classification and the consequent identification of the coffee crops with high precision. As for the relief area, it was noticed that about 99% of the coffee fields are located between 380 and 480 meters of altitude and that 90% of them are located in declivity of up to 8% of inclination. About the soils, it was observed that 89% of the coffee fields are grown over distrofic Red Latosol, of sandy texture.

AB A timely and detailed crop-specific land cover map can support many agricultural applications and decision makings. However, in-season crop mapping over a large area is still challenging due to the insufficiency of ground truth in the early stage of a growing season. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient machine-learning workflow for the rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans fields without ground truth data for the current year. We use trusted pixels, a set of pixels that are predicted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data with high confidence in the current year's crop type, to label training samples on multitemporal satellite images for crop type classification. The entire mapping process only involves a limited number of satellite images acquired within the growing season (normally 3-4 images per scene) and no field data needs to be collected. According to the investigation on 12 states of the U.S. Corn Belt, it is found that a considerable number of trusted pixels can be identified from the historical CDL data by the trusted pixel prediction model based on artificial neural network. According to the experiment on 49 Landsat-8 scenes and 31 Sentinel-2 tiles, the in-season maps of corn and soybeans are expected to reach 85%-95% agreement with CDL as well as field data by mid-July. Once the in-season satellite imagery becomes available, the crop cover map can be rapidly created even with limited computational resources. This study provides a new perspective and detailed guidance for rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans, which can be potentially applied to identify more diverse crop types and scaled up to the entire United States.

ID DECISION TREE; OPTIMIZATION; MODELS
AB Paddy rice is the major crop of food in Taiwan. There are three main contributions of rice cultivation on Taiwan: regional eco-friendly of environments, adjustment of floods, and refreshing the air. The estimation of paddy rice crop area is important since this information is related to the national food policy, yearly crop yields calculation, and post-disaster reimbursement. In the past, a large amount of human power and time-consuming works are performed through field exploration and rice pattern revising. A more economic manner to estimate paddy rice area is desired. Accordingly, this study aims to design a paddy rice classifier by which the evaluation of paddy rice area in a remote sensing image can be rationally performed. In this study, the ant-based clustering optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to present image classification on paddy rice mapping. The advantage of this algorithm is that it can effectively cluster data into groups through unsupervised learning. The ACO implementation can be organized to the following steps: (a) initialize the number of ants, (b) compute the pheromone trail matrix of ants, (c) update the pheromone trail matrix, (d) select the best few ants that have the optimal object function value, and (e) repeat iterations until termination criteria are satisfied. In the meantime, self-organizing map (SOM) clustering was used as a parallel study for comparison. A classifier for paddy rice pattern discernment was built as well as paddy rice thematic maps are drawn. The result shows that ACO clustering algorithm has a higher accuracy than that of SOM.

AB The determination of time for grape harvest is probably the most important decision for wine making producers, because grapes are not climacteric fruits and if they are harvested before fully ripe their quality is compromised. This is because sugar content, aroma and color compounds increase only before harvest for non-climacteric fruits. The current practice for determining berry ripeness includes measurements of berry samples for total soluble solids (TSS) and pH, but this procedure is time consuming and laborious. On the other hand, with the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and modern ultralight cameras the grower can now obtain data rapidly and also spatial information for crop's physiological status at farm scale. Berry samples were collected from grapevines (cv. Malagousia) and their reflectance spectra were used to estimate TSS and pH by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The highest classification accuracy was achieved using the SVM model. Moreover, berries taken by grapevines with low Carotenoid Reflectance Index 2 (CRI2) had higher TSS, pH and terpenes, and gave wine with higher alcohol by volume. The importance for constructing a model for predicting TSS in berries is obvious, because this can aid in the prediction of wine quality. The current work is a preliminary compilation of methodologies for making a monitoring tool of berry ripeness, using statistical techniques, remote sensing and crop physiological data.

AB Mapping agriculture with high accuracy is important to generate reliable information about crop production. Pixel-based methods still present problems with noise and usually require post-processing approaches to reach satisfactory results. Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) enable the detection of homogeneous objects in remote sensing images based on spectral similarity. However, traditional OBIA does not consider the multi-temporal characteristics of land cover or land use, such as agriculture. The objective of this study is to evaluate a phenological object-based approach with dense Landsat image time series for mapping agriculture in different level of detail in the Brazilian Cerrado. We derived pixel-wise EVI fitted time series with 8-day temporal resolution and applied multi-resolution segmentation using all image bands to incorporate the influence of space and time. Then we generated phenological metrics and applied OBIA of agricultural lands in Brazil using a hierarchical classification scheme. The overall accuracies for each hierarchical level were around 90%, and the spatial consistency of the generated maps is promising.

   The paper put forward a new approach based on existed many approach, that merge the category based on the foundation of the traditional cluster. The new approach includes two steps: Firstly, choose a small scale to cluster and not need a category corresponding with a integrate region in image space. Secondly, take the category generated in the first step as object, then merge the category, form the corresponding relationship of the image region and category. The Step is a core of the new approach, it systematize the image segmentation based on multidimensional histograms and form a new approach, which by creating the Separating, Closeness (borderline connect, borderline disconnect and integrate)Tighten Index in characteristic space, creating Gathering, Capturing, Equality, Average between clusters and Average in the cluster Index in image space, Division and classification do constantly between the characteristic space and image space changing the shortage of single space approach, extracting the features information more effective.

AB Developing techniques are required to generate agricultural land cover maps to monitor agricultural fields. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) offers reflectance data over the visible to shortwave-infrared range. OLI offers several advantages, such as adequate spatial and spectral resolution, and 16 day repeat coverage, furthermore, spectral indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI possess great potential for evaluating the status of vegetation. Additionally, classification algorithms are essential for generating accurate maps. Recently, multi-Grained Cascade Forest, which is also called deep forest, was proposed, and it was shown to give highly competitive performance for classification. However, the ability of this algorithm to generate crop maps with satellite data had not yet been evaluated. In this study, the reflectance at 7 bands and 57 spectral indices calculated from Landsat 8 OLI data were evaluated for its potential for crop type identification.

AB Decadal time-series derived from satellite observations are useful for discriminating crops and identifying crop succession at national and regional scales. However, use of these data for crop modeling is challenged by the presence of mixed pixels due to the coarse spatial resolution of these data, which influences model accuracy, and the scarcity of field data over the decadal period necessary to calibrate and validate the model. For this data article, cloud-free satellite "Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 250 m" Terra (MOD13Q1) and Aqua (MYD13Q1) products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as well as the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) vector field data, were collected throughout France for the 12-year period from 2006 to the end of 2017. A GIS workflow was developed using R software to combine the MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products, and then to select "pure" MODIS pixels located within single-crop parcels over the entire period. As a result, a dataset for 21,129 reference plots (corresponding to "pure" pixels) was generated that contained a spectral time-series (red band, near-infrared band, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) and the associated annual crop type with an 8-day time step over the period. This dataset can be used to develop new classification methods based on time-series analysis using deep learning, and to monitor and predict crop succession. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB The Taiwan sites, organized by Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research of National Central University, were planned as four sites: West Taiwan, South Taiwan, 921 Quake, and Ken Ting. West Taiwan site and South Taiwan site were selected for the study of land cover, ship detection, and coastal mapping using 40 MHz POLSAR and 80 MHz HiSAR[1], respectively. There are various types of agricultural crops and vegetations in West Taiwan site. The HiSAR data of South Taiwan site acquisition was centred on Kao Hsiung Harbor for the study of ship detection. The other two sites, 921 Quake site and Ken Ting site were selected for generating digital elevation model using XTI1 ping pong TOPSAR mode and XTI2 ping pong TOPSAR mode, respectively. The terrain was strongly deformed by 921 Great Quake (Chi-Chi Quake) in Sep. 21, 1999. The purpose of 921 Quake site is to generate digital elevation model of disaster area of 921 Quake and to study the land deformation by comparing with historical data and GPS survey. Finally, Ken Ting site was planned in part as verification site for SRTM and PACRIM I[1].
   The ground truths over these sites were also collected by field trip from Sep. 26 to Sep. 28, 2000 by aids of unmanned remote helicopter sensing. There are total five sets of ground truth: 1) Hsin-Chu, an important wetland area located in North-west Taiwan. 2) Costal lines of West Taiwan. 3) Kao-Hsiung Harbor, in which types and locations of ships entering and leaving the harbor were recorded by means of coastal radar. 4) Tai-Chung Harbor, where the land covers in-, and outside of the harbor was recorded by photography. 5) Au-Ku Farm Field, which is an agricultural field and is cultivated with sugar cane and rice. The cultivating area is arranged regularly and shaped as rectangle. The land cover of each cultivation area was recorded. The fishpond outside the field was photographed by remote helicopter. Besides, overpass remote sensing sensor data from SPOT and RADARSAT were also acquired during the campaign.
   This paper outlines the applications of POLSAR and TOPSAR data in the area of costal monitoring, land subsidence and deformation, and terrain cover classification. It is hoped that these demonstration will lead to future operational use of SAR data in these study areas.

AB In this article, a multiple dimensional Look-Up-Table (LUT) is generated based on the PROSAIL model for multiple crops LAI estimation from unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral data. Based on Taylor expansion method (TEM) and computational geometry model (CGM), a scale transfer model considering both difference between inter-class and intraclass is constructed for scale effect analysis of LAI inversion over inhomogeneous surface. The results indicate that, 1) the LUT method based on classification and parameter sensitive analysis is useful for LAI retrieval of corn, potato, sunflower and melon on Baotou test site, with correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.85 and root mean square error RMSE of 0.41m(2)/m(2). 2) The scale effect of LAI is becoming obvious with the decrease of resolution, and scale difference between inter-classes is higher than that of intra-class, which can be corrected efficiently by the scale transfer model established based Taylor expansion and Computational geometry. 3) Further research could focus on multiple scale remote sensing products validation based on the scale transfer model mentioned above.

AB Classification of crop species is an actively studied topic in remote sensing using multi spectral image sensors. Unfortunately, the spectral bands available in the multispectral imagery are broad and limited in number to classify the crop species. In this paper, we propose optimal spectral bands to classify Allium (garlic and onion) and Brassicaceae (Chinese cabbage and radish) by using higher-dimensional data from hyperspectral imagery. A decision-tree classifier was used to determine the optimal method to use the high dimensional data. The high-dimensional data were analysed for all growth stages and considering bandwidths with different full width at half maximum (FWHM) values at 25, 40, 50 and 80 nm. The spectral bands selected for Allium were differentiated into green, blue, and NIR bands for each growth stage. The results show that Allium can be classified clearly as overall accuracy (OA) 1 and kappa coefficient 1 for all FWHM based on March 22 data. For each April 19 and May 12 data, the decision-tree classifier with each 80 nm FWHM and 50 nm FWHM yielded a better classification accuracy of more than OA 0.921 and kappa coefficient 0.839 than other FWHM. The spectral bands selected for Brassicaceae were found to be similar to blue band for all growth stages. Brassicaceae was classified clearly for all FWHM based on October 27 data. Also, Brassicaceae was classified clearly for 25 nm FWHM based on November 25 data and OA, kappa coefficient for 40 nm FWHM and 50 nm FWHM are high as 0.974, 0.947 respectively. (C) 2018 IAgrE.

AB Creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis (L.) Scop.) is a perennial weed that causes yield loss in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) crops. The weeds are usually mapped for site specific weed management because they tend to grow in patches. Remote sensing techniques have shown promising results in species discrimination and therefore provide potential for weed mapping. In this study we examined the feasibility of high-resolution imaging for sugar beet and thistle discrimination and proposed a protocol to select multispectral camera filters. Spectral samples from sugar beet and thistle were acquired with a field portable spectroradiometer under field conditions and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) classification models were developed with 211 and 36 spectral features of 1.56 and 10 nm bandwidths, respectively. The classification rates obtained using these models were regarded as the maximum obtainable. Then, spectral responses of a multiband camera equipped with the filter configuration proposed by the PLS-DA models were simulated. Finally, a simulation of crop-weed discrimination was made using small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based multispectral images. More than 95% of the thistles and 89% of the sugar beets were correctly classified when continuous spectral data were used with 1.56 and 10 nm bandwidths. Accuracy dropped to 93% of thistles identified and 84% of sugar beets correctly classified when only the four best bands were used. The validation based on aerial images showed that sugar beets and thistle plants could be discriminated in images if sufficient pure pixels containing leaf spectra were available, that is with spatial resolutions of 6 mm pixel(-1) or finer.

AB Satellite images have enormous potential for qualitative land use analysis. This paper presents empirical results that demonstrate how normally invisible dimensions produced by land use can be identified by enriching satellite data with qualitative information from field studies.
   Land use can be defined as the intentional use of a specific piece of land resulting in patterns of ecological responses that are visible in the land cover and landscape. Responses to land use often result in a heterogeneous combination of reflectance in satellite images. Statistical methods used in the classification of satellite imagery are limited in their capacity to handle categories consisting of heterogeneous combinations of spectral values. To overcome this limitation, a contextual post-classification method has been used to map land cover configurations as related to different agricultural practices in the district of Sodo, Ethiopia.
   The results show that it is possible to map socio-spatial distribution of different agricultural and socioeconomic practices on a regional level by combining field observations and spatial contextual information. The empirical findings show local agricultural activity variations in cash crop production and subsistence agriculture in the Sodo district of Ethiopia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents hierarchical clustering algorithms for solving the task of crop classification using a multispectral satellite image. The hierarchical clustering algorithms uses splitting and merging techniques, w here splitting is used to obtain ideal possible clusters along with its centers. The clusters with its centers are then merged based on a parametric method. Three hierarchical clustering algorithms, namely, the Niche Hierarchical Artificial Immune System (NHAIS), Niche Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO), and Niche Genetic Algorithm (NGA) are applied here for classification. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm, results are presented for a real-time multispectral satellite image and an additional benchmark data set from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository. A performance comparison between all the three hierarchical clustering algorithms are presented and analyzed. The obtained results show that the NHAIS is most efficient among presented approaches.

AB Water resources planning and management is fundamental for food security, environmental conservation, economic development and livelihoods. In complex basins like the Indus Basin, water is utilized by different land cover and land uses. Up to date information about these Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes provide essential information on the water flow path. Traditionally, landscapes are described by cover type. For water management analysis, the information on land use is vital. To this end, a classification of LULC in the Indus Basin (covering 116.2 million hectares of Pakistan, India, China and Afghanistan) has been made. Vegetation index images freely available from SPOT-Vegetation satellite were used to describe the phenological cycle of all agro-ecosystems at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. An unsupervised clustering technique was adapted to classify 27 land use classes. Ground information and expert knowledge on the growing patterns of crops was used to label the resulting LULC classes. This helped to discern specific crops and crop rotations. An error matrix was prepared using ground truthing data to evaluate the classification accuracy. Existing global, regional and local studies were also considered for validation. The results show an overall accuracy of 77%, with the producer's accuracy being 78% and user's accuracy 83%. The Kappa coefficient (0.73) shows moderate agreement between on ground and satellite derived map. This is deemed sufficient for supporting water management analysis. The availability of major crop rotation statistics and types of forests and savanna is key information for the input data in hydrological models and water accounting frameworks.

AB To support farmers and improve the quality of crops production, designing of smart greenhouses is becoming indispensable. In this paper, a novel prototype for remote monitoring of a greenhouse is designed. The prototype allows creating an adequate artificial environment inside the greenhouse (e.g., water irrigation, ventilation, light intensity, and CO2 concentration). Thanks to the Internet of things technique, the parameters controlled (air temperature, relative humidity, capacitive soil moisture, light intensity, and CO2 concentration) were measured and uploaded to a designed webpage using appropriate sensors with a low-cost Wi-Fi module (NodeMCU V3). An Android mobile application was also developed using an A6 GSM module for notifying farmers (e.g., sending a warning message in case of any anomaly) regarding the state of the plants. A low-cost camera was used to collect and send images of the plants via the webpage for possible diseases identification and classification. In this context, a deep learning convolutional neural network was developed and implemented into a Raspberry Pi 4. To supply the prototype, a small-scale photovoltaic system was built. The experimental results showed the feasibility and demonstrated the ability of the prototype to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely, as well as to identify the state of the plants. The designed smart prototype can offer real-time remote measuring and sensing services to farmers.

AB In classification of satellite images acquired over smallholder agricultural landscape with complex spectral profiles of various crop types, exploring image spatial information is important. The deep convolutional neural network (CNN), originally designed for natural image recognition in the computer vision field, can automatically explore high level spatial information and thus is promising for such tasks. This study tried to evaluate different CNN structures for classification of four smallholder agricultural landscapes in Heilongjiang, China using pan-sharpened 2 m GaoFen-1 (meaning high resolution in Chinese) satellite images. CNN with three pooling strategies: without pooling, with max pooling and with average pooling, were evaluated and compared with random forest. Two different numbers (70,000 and 290,000) of CNN learnable parameters were examined for each pooling strategy. The training and testing samples were systematically sampled from reference land cover maps to ensure sample distribution proportional to the reference land cover occurrence and included 60,000-400,000 pixels to ensure effective training. Testing sample classification results in the four study areas showed that the best pooling strategy was the average pooling CNN and that the CNN significantly outperformed random forest (2.4-3.3% higher overall accuracy and 0.05-0.24 higher kappa coefficient). Visual examination of CNN classification maps showed that CNN can discriminate better the spectrally similar crop types by effectively exploring spatial information. CNN was still significantly outperformed random forest using training samples that were evenly distributed among classes. Furthermore, future research to improve CNN performance was discussed.

TI The 10-m crop type maps in Northeast China during 2017-2019
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA

DT Article; Data Paper
AB Northeast China is the leading grain production region in China where one-fifth of the national grain is produced; however, consistent and reliable crop maps are still unavailable, impeding crop management decisions for regional and national food security. Here, we produced annual 10-m crop maps of the major crops (maize, soybean, and rice) in Northeast China from 2017 to 2019, by using (1) a hierarchical mapping strategy (cropland mapping followed by crop classification), (2) agro-climate zone-specific random forest classifiers, (3) interpolated and smoothed 10-day Sentinel-2 time series data, and (4) optimized features from spectral, temporal, and texture characteristics of the land surface. The resultant maps have high overall accuracies (OA) spanning from 0.81 to 0.86 based on abundant ground truth data. The satellite estimates agreed well with the statistical data for most of the municipalities (R-2 >= 0.83, p<0.01). This is the first effort on regional annual crop mapping in China at the 10-m resolution, which permits assessing the performance of the soybean rejuvenation plan and crop rotation practice in China.

AB The objective of this work is to evaluate the capacity of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series imagery, acquired by the European satellite Sentinel-1 (S1), for the agriculture crop classification and its reliability to differentiate onion from sunflower, among others. The work then focused on classifying land cover in intensively cultivated agricultural regions. The study was developed in the Bonaerense Valley of the Colorado River (BVCR), Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, backed up by the field truth of 1634 field samples. In addition to the onion and sunflower crops, there are other crops present in the study area such as cereals, alfalfa, potatoes and maize, which are considered as the image background in the classification process. The field samples database was used for training and supporting a supervised classification with two machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-obtaining high levels of accuracy in each case. Different S1 SAR time-series features were used to assess the performance of S1 crop classification in terms of polarization VH+VV, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) image texture and a combination of both. The analysis of SAR data and their features was carried out at OBIA lot level (Object Based Image Analysis) showing an optimal strategy to counteract the effect of the residual and inherent speckle noise of the radar signal. In the process of differentiating onion and sunflower crops, the analysis of the VH+VV stack with the SVM algorithm delivered the best statistical classification results in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index, (Kp) when other crops (image background) were not considered (OA = 95.35%, Kp = 0.89). Certainly, the GLCM texture analysis derived from the S1 SAR images is a valuable source of information for obtaining very good classification results. When differentiating sunflower from onion considering also other crops present in the BVCR, the GLCM stack proved to be the most suitable dataset analyzed in this work (OA = 89.98%, Kp = 0.66 for SVM algorithm). This working methodology is applicable to other irrigated valleys in Argentina dedicated to intensive crops. There are also variables inherent to each lot, soil, crop and agricultural producer that differ according to the study area and that should be considered for each case in the future.

AB Objects on the surface of earth describe unique patterns in time and this is exploited in the proposed land cover classification method enumerated in this paper. The applicability of various distance measures to reasonably find similarity or dissimilarity between time series vegetation index patterns for land cover classification is demonstrated. These distance metrics have inherent advantages for satellite image classification as land use practices such as field crops/vegetation exhibit temporal shifts from pixel to pixel based on the geographic location. Experimental results on time series of MODIS EVI (250m) and AWiFS derived NDVI (56m) demonstrate the applicability and validate the performance of the proposed method. The classification method is also compared with k nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier to understand its utility.

AB Sentinel-2 images are expected to improve global crop monitoring even in challenging tropical small agricultural systems that are characterized by high intra- and inter-field spatial variability and where satellite observations are disturbed by the presence of clouds. To overcome these constraints, we analyzed and optimized the performance of a combined Random Forest (RF) classifier/object-based approach and applied it to multisource satellite data to produce land use maps of a smallholder agricultural zone in Madagascar at five different nomenclature levels. The RF classifier was first optimized by reducing the number of input variables. Experiments were then carried out to (i) test cropland masking prior to the classification of more detailed nomenclature levels, (ii) analyze the importance of each data source (a high spatial resolution (HSR) time series, a very high spatial resolution (VHSR) coverage and a digital elevation model (DEM)) and data type (spectral, textural or other), and (iii) quantify their contributions to classification accuracy levels. The results show that RF classifier optimization allowed for a reduction in the number of variables by 1.5- to 6-fold (depending on the classification level) and thus a reduction in the data processing time. Classification results were improved via the hierarchical approach at all classification levels, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.7% and 64.4% for the cropland and crop subclass levels, respectively. Spectral variables derived from an HSR time series were shown to be the most discriminating, with a better score for spectral indices over the reflectances. VHSR data were only found to be essential when implementing the segmentation of the area into objects and not for the spectral or textural features they can provide during classification.

AB Soil salinity, caused by natural or human-induced processes, is not only a major cause of soil degradation but also a major environmental hazard all over the world. This results in increasing impact on crop yields and agricultural production in both dry and irrigated areas due to poor land and water management.
   Multi-temporal optical and microwave remote sensing can significantly contribute to detecting spatial-temporal changes of salt-related surface features. The study area is located in the west of Jilin Province, Northeast China, which is one of most important saline-alkalized areas in semi-arid and and area in North China. Decision tree classifiers are used to improve the classification of soil salinity on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images in later autumn of 1996. The Kauth-Thomas (K-T) transformation was performed after TM image preprocessing including image registration, mosaic and resizing for the study area. Then the first component of KT transformation, TM 6 imagery (thermal infrared imagery), and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from TM 4 and TM 3 images, were density-sliced respectively to establish suitable feature classes of soil salinity as the decision nodes. Thus, the classification of soil salinity was improved using decision trees based on these feature classes.
   Compared with the conventional maximum likelihood classification, this method is more effective to distinguish soil salinity from mixed residential and sand areas in the west of Jilin Province. China.

AB Water stress limits wheat growth and the yield on rain-fed sodic soils. Appropriate selection of traits and novel methods are required to forecast yield and to identify water stress tolerant wheat genotypes on sodic soils. In this study, we proposed a thermal remote sensing and machine learning-based approach to help predict the biomass and grain yields of wheat genotypes grown with variable water stress in sodic soil environments. We employed unmanned aerial vehicle-based thermal imaging to quantify water stress of 18 contrasting wheat genotypes grown on moderately sodic (MS) and highly sodic (HS) soils in north-eastern grains growing regions of Australia and related these to ground-measured plant biomass and grain yields. We evaluated crop water stress indices; standardized canopy temperature index, crop water stress index, stomatal conductance index, vapour pressure deficit, and crop stress index, which were computed from thermal imagery and on-site agro-meteorological parameters close to flowering. We then employed a classification and regression tree (CRT) as a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify crop water stress and predict biomass and grain yields as a function of crop water stress indices. The CRT accurately predicted biomass yield (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.86; root mean square error (RMSE) = 41.3 g/m(2) and R-2 = 0.75; RMSE = 47.7 g/m(2) for the MS and HS site) and grain yield (R-2 = 0.78; RMSE = 16.7 g/m(2) and R-2 = 0.69; RMSE = 23.2 g/m(2) for the MS and HS site, respectively). High sodic soil constraints increased crop water stress more than moderately sodic constraints soil that limits wheat yield similar to 40%. Wheat genotypes; Bremer, Gregory, Lancer, Mace, and Mitch were more productive than Gladius, Flanker, Scout, Emu Rock, and Janz in sodic soil environments. The study improves our ability to develop decision-making tools to assist farmers and breeders in securing agricultural productivity on sodic soils.

AB Accurate crop identification and spatial distribution mapping are important for crop production estimation and famine early warning, especially for food-deficit African agricultural countries. By evaluating existing preprocessing methods for classification using satellite image time series (SITS) in Kenya, this study aimed to provide a low-cost method for cultivated land monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa that lacks financial support. SITS were composed of a set of MODIS Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) in 2018, and the classification method included the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifier. Eight datasets obtained at three levels of preprocessing from MOD13Q1 were used in the classification: (1) raw SITS of vegetation indices (R-NDVI, R-EVI, and R-NDVI + R-EVI); (2) smoothed SITS of vegetation indices (S-NDVI); and (3) vegetation phenological data (P-NDVI, P-EVI, R-NDVI + P-NDVI, and P-NDVI-1). Both SVM and RF classification results showed that the "R-NDVI + R-EVI" dataset achieved the highest performance, while the three pure phenological datasets produced the lowest accuracy. Correlation analysis between variable importance and rainfall time series demonstrated that the vegetation index SITS during rainfall periods showed higher importance in RF classifiers, thus revealing the potential of saving computational costs. Considering the preprocessing cost of SITS and its negative impact on the classification accuracy, we recommend overlaying the original NDVI with the original EVI time series to map the crop distribution in Kenya.

AB Geospatial Big Data is currently received overwhelming attention and are on highlight globally and Google Earth Engine (GEE) is currently the hot pot platform to cater big data processing for Remote Sensing and GIS. Currently few or no study regarding the usage of this platform to study land use/cover changes over years in Malaysia. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of GEE as a free cloud-based platform by performing classification of Klang Valley area from Landsat composites of three different years (1988-2003-2018) using multiple Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA). The best classification results were then imported and further processed to quantify the changes over the years using commercial software. Although, the classification results are of high accuracy but CART shows the best accuracy with 94.71%, 97.72% and 96.57% in 1988, 2003 and 2018 in comparison with RF and SVM. Some misclassified pixels were encountered because the annual composited images were compiled without taken into considerations of crops phenological stages (paddy) which resulted to the misclassified agricultural land into urban and bare land. Hence, the selection and composition of data initially had to be structured and strategized prior to processing as they can affect the classification result and further analysis. Regardless, GEE has performed quite well and fast in term of time and processing complexity of multiple datasets with minimal human interaction and intervention. Generally, GEE has proven to be reliable in fulfilling the objectives of this study to evaluate the GEE feasibility by performing classification and quantifying the land use/cover of studied area and provide good base for further analysis using different platform.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the ability of optical images, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images and the combination of both types of data to discriminate between grasslands and crops in agricultural areas where cloud cover is very high most of the time, which restricts the use of visible and near-infrared satellite data. We compared the performances of variables extracted from four optical and five SAR satellite images with high/very high spatial resolutions acquired during the growing season. A vegetation index, namely the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and two biophysical variables, the LAI (Leaf Area Index) and the fCOVER (fraction of Vegetation Cover) were computed using optical time series and polarization (HH, VV, HV, VH). The polarization ratio and polarimetric decomposition (Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier) were calculated using SAR time series. Then, variables derived from optical, SAR and both types of remotely-sensed data were successively classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. The results show that the classification accuracy of SAR variables is higher than those using optical data (0.98 compared to 0.81). They also highlight that the combination of optical and SAR time series data is of prime interest to discriminate grasslands from crops, allowing an improved classification accuracy.

AB A time series of nine ERS-1 SAR images of the MARS sample site Seville, four SPOT XS images and ground surveys of 17 MARS segments all from 1992 have been available for the study. Preliminary masks of non-agricultural areas derived from thematic maps are refined by multi-temporal, unsupervised classification of optical satellite data. Stratification was performed using visual interpretation of SPOT data for refining macro-structural units of the region around Seville extracted from relevant literature. During preliminary investigations it turned out, that significance of supervised classification is limited due to limitations of the available ground truth. A robust, transferable approach is presented, which allows to retrieve crop types/single crops from ERS-1 SAR data on the base of unsupervised clustering. The recombination of clusters to classes is performed using ancillary knowledge (e.g. local agricultural practice, parcel structure). The method is detailed with the example of a single stratum. Application to the other strata of the Seville site proved functionality of the method. There are significant indications, that ERS-1 SAR data could be used as complementer substitute to optical satellite data. With regard to the operational needs of the MARS project the potential for an operationalisation of the approach seems to be high.

AB Plastic mulching on farmland has been increasing worldwide for decades due to its superior advantages for improving crop yields. Monitoring Plastic-Mulched Land-cover (PML) can provide essential information for making agricultural management decisions and reducing PML's eco-environmental impacts. However, mapping PML with remote sensing data is still challenging and problematic due to its complicated and mixed characteristics. In this study, a new Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach has been proposed to investigate the potential for combined use of Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multi-spectral data to extract PML. Based on the ESP2 tool (Estimation of Scale Parameter 2) and ED2 index (Euclidean Distance 2), the optimal Multi-Resolution Segmentation (MRS) result is chosen as the basis of following object-based classification. Spectral and backscattering features, index features and texture features from S1 and S2 are adopted in classifying PML and other land-cover types. Three machine-learning classifiers known as the-Classification and Regression Tree (CART), the Random Forest (RF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) are carried out and compared in this study. The best classification result with an overall accuracy of 94.34% is achieved by using spectral, backscattering, index and textural information from integrated S1 and S2 data with the SVM classifier. Texture information is demonstrated to contribute positively to PML classifications with SVM and RF classifiers. PML mapping using SAR information alone has been greatly improved by the object-based approach to an overall accuracy of 87.72%. By adding SAR data into optical data, the accuracy of object-based PML classifications has also been improved by 1-3%.

ID COVER CLASSIFICATION
AB Soya is a widely grown crop in many countries worldwide, being United States, Brazil, Argentina and China the major producers. In Brazil, in the last three decades an explosive growth in production has occurred, nearly thirty times, causing a chain of unprecedent changes of land uses and land cover (LULC) in the territory. Therefore, it becomes highly necessary to develop means to monitor such LULC changes, and remote sensing is one of the more potential tools for this monitoring. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology for contributing in the mapping and monitoring soybeans planted areas, with time-series of remotely sensed Landsat imagery. Two main techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map soybeans areas, and DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. The study area comprises three municipalities in the northwest of Sao Paulo State, being this area well representative of the agricultural conditions of the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. The statistics indicated an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.88. These results indicate that the combination of OBIA + DM + multitemporal imagery is very efficient and promising for the soybeans mapping process.

AB With the ever-increasing number of satellites and the availability of data free of charge, the integration of multi-sensor images in coherent time series offers new opportunities for land cover and crop type classification. This article investigates the potential of structural biophysical variables as common parameters to consistently combine multi-sensor time series and to exploit them for land/crop cover classification. Artificial neural networks were trained based on a radiative transfer model in order to retrieve high resolution LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER from Landsat-8 and SPOT-4. The correlation coefficients between field measurements and the retrieved biophysical variables were 0.83, 0.85 and 0.79 for LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER, respectively. The retrieved biophysical variables' time series displayed consistent average temporal trajectories, even though the class variability and signal-to-noise ratio increased compared to NDVI. Six random forest classifiers were trained and applied along the season with different inputs: spectral bands, NDVI, as well as FAPAR, LAI and FCOVER, separately and jointly. Classifications with structural biophysical variables reached end-of-season overall accuracies ranging from 73%-76% when used alone and 77% when used jointly. This corresponds to 90% and 95% of the accuracy level achieved with the spectral bands and NDVI. FCOVER appears to be the most promising biophysical variable for classification. When assuming that the cropland extent is known, crop type classification reaches 89% with spectral information, 87% with the NDVI and 81%-84% with biophysical variables.

AB Annual and within-season crop type monitoring and mapping is an important ongoing consideration for governments, global agricultural monitoring organizations and private interests worldwide. Successful country-wide operational remote sensing-based inventories are well-established utilizing optical-only and optical/single frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) combinations of data. However, the drawbacks of these data combinations are the requirement of multiple sources of imagery throughout the entire growing season, which impedes within-season analysis, and cloud cover effects on the optical data. Currently, C-band SAR data are available with continuous global coverage from Sentinel-1A & B, RADARSAT-2 and from the expected launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). With current and expected launches of several other frequency (L-, P-, etc.) SAR missions over the next few years (SAOCOM, NISAR, etc.) the opportunity for continuous, multi-frequency SAR coverage edges toward reality. The JECAM SAR Inter-Comparison Experiment is a multi-year, multi-partner project that aims to compare global methods for SAR-based crop monitoring and inventory. The third component of this experiment is the assessment of multi-frequency SAR data for crop classification and mapping. Earth observation (EO) data acquisitions of Sentinel-1A & B, RADARSAT-2/RCM, ALOS-2, SAOCOM1 and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X have been planned and requested for the 2019 growing season to complement within field surveys being conducted across the globe. In preparation for these data, this research analyzed ALOS-2, TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data for crop mapping at the JECAM Canada-Carman site using two dates of multi-frequency SAR data, in comparison to a traditional full season optical/SAR dataset. The multi-frequency data had similar overall accuracies as the optical/SAR dataset, and improved on several individual agricultural class accuracies.

AB Classification of crops and other land cover types is an important application of both optical/infrared and SAR satellite data. It is already an import application of present satellite systems, as it will be for planned missions, such as the Sentinels. An airborne SAR data set with a short revisit time acquired by the German ESAR system during the ESA-campaign, AgriSAR 2006, has been used to assess the performance of different polarization modes for crop classification. Both C-and L-band SAR data were acquired over the Demmin agricultural test site in North Eastern Germany on a weekly basis during the growing season. Single-and dual-polarization, and fully polarimetric data have been used in the analysis (fully polarimetric data were only available at L-band). The main results of the analysis are, that multitemporal acquisitions are very important for single-and dual-polarization modes, and that cross-polarized backscatter produces the best results, with errors down to 3%-6% at the two frequencies. There is a trade-off between the polarimetric information and the multitemporal information, where the best overall results are obtained using the multitemporal information. If only a few acquisitions are available, the polarimetric mode may perform better than the single-and dual polarization modes.

AB Torreya (T. grandis 'Merrillii') is a rare cash crop tree endemic to Kuaiji mountains of southern China. The present research demonstrated the use of spatial information in object-based classification for improving the identification of Torreya from IKONOS images. Pixel-based and object-based classifications on a combination of spectral and textural features were implemented and their accuracies were compared. The object-based classification proved more accurate than the pixel-based classification. The overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficients were 75.7% and 0.676 for the pixel-based classification; 81.7% and 0.746 for the object-based classification. The overall results demonstrate that object-based classification of very high resolution satellite images using additional features is a practical tool for vegetation mapping in the study area.

AB The use of satellite imagery data to accurately map agricultural land use in semi-arid Africa has proven difficult due to the small size of cropped fields, low vegetative cover within and outside cropped areas, and high correlation between the seasonal trajectories in the signatures of cropped and uncropped surfaces. This paper evaluates the potential of computer-aided classification of multi-temporal imagery data to map traditionally-managed rice fields in Sahelian West Africa. SPOT-XS imagery data covering the southwestern corner of the Inland Niger Delta of Mall were acquired on three dates in 1988. These dares encompass the pre-flood period when ploughed surfaces contrast strongly with surrounding land surface and the first half of the flood period. Two alternative classification approaches were evaluated. Supervised and unsupervised classification of a database formed by principal component reduction proved unsuccessful as a result of the high spectral heterogeneity of ploughed and unploughed surfaces. An alternative classification approach was developed which utilizes a series of steps (unsupervised classification, stratification, and supervised classification) that progressively reduce image heterogeneity in such a way to better aid interpretation and comparison with training data. Seventy-one per cent of ploughed-field reference sites were classified correctly using this approach, while 8-20 per cent of reference sites for cover types with a potential for being confused with ploughed fields were misclassified as ploughed fields. A fuller evaluation was performed using a posterior accuracy assessment of classifications produced at five intermediate stages of the procedure. The suitability of the procedure for land-use classification in spectrally-heterogenous areas is discussed.

AB The systematic use of satellite images to support crop damage assessment has been hampered by two reasons: lack of satellite systems with high revisit frequency have made it difficult to image affected areas within the necessary time windows, and second, the high cost of satellite images with appropriate resolution have made their integration into existing processes too costly to be valuable. RapidEye has developed an operational service to produce damage assessment maps on insured fields in the U. S. corn belt that overcomes these problems. The service will be capable of delivering the maps in a suitable time frame by taking advantage of the RapidEye constellation. The production of these maps is based on analysis of after-storm images only, thus reducing the cost of the service. The processing is based on a six step process that includes: pre-processing of the images; estimation of agricultural land vegetation parameters from the imagery; separation of corn from soybean fields; estimation of the statistical descriptors for corn and soybean fields separately; inner-field classification into damage classes; and integration of the results in maps with road and land cover data. Results from the 2008 and 2009 crop seasons are presented.

AB Due to the very fragmentation of cultivated land in Guangdong Province, there are few studies on the cultivated land multiple cropping index (MCI), which can not meet the needs of agricultural production and policy. Therefore, this paper selects the 2015 paddy field data of Guangdong Province and uses the 16-day synthetic MODIS-EVI data from 2014 to 2016, Savitzky-Golay and Asymmetric Gaussian methods are used to reconstruct multi-temporal remote sensing data, and quadratic difference algorithm is used to extract the paddy field MCF. A comparative analysis of the two methods shows that the Asymmetric Gaussian function fitting is more suitable for a single season. The Savitzky-Golay filtering is more sensitive, and there are many pseudo-peaks in the fitted curve, resulting in a large extraction result compared with verification data. The twice Savitzky-Golay filtering further smooths the curve and removes a large number of false peaks, which is more suitable for the vegetation characteristics of paddy fields in Guangdong Province; The paddy field planting area is highly correlated with the rice planting area, but there are rice-peanut, rice-sweet potato and rice-sweet sugarcane planting patterns in the paddy field. In addition, the classification accuracy of paddy fields is one of the main influencing factors, so it is difficult to extract rice planting area accurately; During 2014-2016, the paddy field in Guangdong Province is dominated by double cropping system. The area of single cropping system is increased and then decreased, and the area of the double cropping system is reduced and then increased. The fallow paddy fields are mainly distributed around the construction land, especially in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

AB Crops and bodies of water are a topic of interest to countries. Having information about growing areas, water sources and their behaviour in the different seasons of the year is useful for agricultural production and decision-making. On the other hand. a large amount of Earth satellite data and tools for the processing of large Volumes of satellite images have now been generated that are critical for forest monitoring, multiteinporal analysis of growing areas and bodies of water, classification of land use, among others. Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation program consisting of 13 spectral bands that provide high spatial resolution and radiometric quality images. This article presents a multitemporal analysis based on the Standardized Difference Vegetation Index and Standardized Difference Water Index obtained with images of the Sentinel-2 satellite, for the identification of changes that occur in an area of south-eastern Mexico in the period 2018-2020. The results obtained demonstrate a low range of radiometric indexes in the study areas during 2018. In addition, the biggest changes during the rainy season were recorded in 2018; this shows the provocation in the decrease in crop quality and in the body of water.

AB Hyperspectral datasets are widely used in many applications of remote sensing in the fields of agriculture, forestry, weather, urban planning, water study, biodiversity and surface changes. Our focus is agriculture with different perspectives such as classifications of crops, identification of different crop growth stages, fallow land, etc. However, the major challenge in working with hyperspectral data is the large number of narrow bands to deal with while having lack of fully labelled ground-truth data sometimes. In this paper, we propose a new band selection algorithm using the statistical parameter, spectral information divergence (SID), from the hyperspectral dataset. A hypothesis of the proposed band selection algorithm is if two most similar crops can be discriminated based on the lowest SID value, then other crops can also be discriminated. Subsequently, we use three classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbours and artificial neural network (ANN) and present the performance of the algorithm using simulations with the two performance parameters, i.e. overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient. We have applied the algorithm on the three datasets: AVIRIS-NG dataset of Anand district in the state of Gujarat of India, Indian Pines dataset of northern-western Indiana state of the USA and Salinas dataset of Salinas Valley of California state of the USA. We have obtained the OA of 97.55% with the selection of 20 bands using SVM in the case of the AVIRIS-NG dataset. If we increase the selection to 40 bands, there is a nominal improvement in OA, i.e. 98.40%. We have also presented the performance of some prevailing algorithms working on band correlation analysis on the same datasets. We conclude that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prevailing ones.

AB The potential use of the interferometric coherence measured with Sentinel-1 satellites as input feature for crop classification is explored in this study. A one-year time-series of Sentinel-1 images acquired over an agricultural area in Spain, in which 17 crop species are present, is exploited for this purpose. Different options regarding temporal baselines, polarization, and combination with radiometric data (backscattering coefficient) are analyzed. Results show that both radiometric and interferometric features provide notable classification accuracy when used individually (overall accuracy lies between 70% and 80%). It is found that the shortest temporal baseline coherences (6 days) and the use of all available intensity images perform best, hence proving the advantage of the 6-day revisit time provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation with respect to longer revisit times. It is also shown that dual-pol data always provide better classification results than single-pol ones. More importantly, when both coherence and backscattering coefficient are jointly used, a significant increase in accuracy is obtained (greater than 7% in overall accuracies). Individual accuracies of all crop types are increased, and an overall accuracy above 86% is reached. This proves that both features provide complementary information, and that the combination of interferometric and radiometric radar data constitutes a solid information source for this application.

AB National-level mapping of crop types is important to monitor food security, understand environmental conditions, inform optimal use of the landscape, and contribute to agricultural policy. Countries or economic regions currently and increasingly use satellite sensor data for classifying crops over large areas. However, most methods have been based on machine learning algorithms, with these often requiring large training datasets that are not always available and may be costly to produce or collect. Focusing on Wales (United Kingdom), the research demonstrates how the knowledge that the agricultural community has gathered together over past decades can be used to develop algorithms for mapping different crop types. Specifically, we aimed to develop an alternative method for consistent and accurate crop type mapping where cloud cover is quite persistent and without the need for extensive in situ/ground datasets. The classification approach is parcel-based and informed by concomitant analysis of knowledge-based crop growth stages and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR time series. For 2018, crop type classifications were generated nationally for Wales, with regional overall accuracies ranging between 85.8% and 90.6%. The method was particularly successful in distinguishing barley from wheat, which is a major source of error in other crop products available for Wales. This study demonstrates that crops can be accurately identified and mapped across a large area (i.e., Wales) using Sentinel-1 C-band data and by capitalizing on knowledge of crop growth stages. The developed algorithm is flexible and, compared to the other methods that allow crop mapping in Wales, the approach provided more consistent discrimination and lower variability in accuracies between classes and regions.

AB The paradox between environmental conservation and economic development is a challenge for Brazil, where there is a complex and dynamic agricultural scenario. This reinforces the need for effective methods for the detailed mapping of agriculture. In this work, we employed land surface phenological metrics derived from dense satellite image time series to classify agricultural land in the Cerrado biome. We used all available Landsat images between April 2013 and April 2017, applying a weighted ensemble of Radial Basis Function (RBF) convolution filters as a kernel smoother to fill data gaps such as cloud cover and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off data. Through this approach, we created a dense Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data cube with an 8-day temporal resolution and derived phenometrics for a Random Forest (RF) classification. We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. Most of the classes showed accuracies higher than 90%. Single crop and Non-commercial crop classes presented lower accuracies. However, we showed that phenometrics derived from dense Landsat-like image time series, in a hierarchical classification scheme, has a great potential for detailed agricultural mapping. The results are promising and show that the method is consistent and robust, being applicable to mapping agricultural land throughout the entire Cerrado.

AB Land use and land cover maps can support our understanding of coupled human-environment systems and provide important information for environmental modeling and water resource management. Satellite data are a valuable source for land use and land cover mapping. However, cloud-free or weather independent data are necessary to map cloud-prone regions. This particularly applies to monsoon regions such as the Chennai basin, located in the north of Tamil Nadu and the south of Andhra Pradesh, India, which is influenced by the South Asian Monsoon and has abundant cloud cover, throughout the monsoon season. The Basin is characterized by small-scale agriculture with multiple cropping seasons and the rapidly developing metropolitan area of Chennai. This study aims to generate a land use and land cover map of the Chennai Basin for the cropping season of Rabi 2015/16 and to assess the influence of combining the new ESA Copernicus satellites Sentinel-1 and -2 on classification accuracies. A Random Forest based wrapper approach was applied to select the most relevant radar (Sentinel-1) images for the combination with the optical (Sentinel-2) data. Area proportion weighted accuracy with 95% confidence interval were estimated for the Random Forest models, which differentiated 13 land cover classes. The highest overall accuracy of 91.53% +/- 0.89 pp was achieved with a combination of 1 Sentinel-2 and 8 Sentinel-1 scenes. This is an improvement of 5.68 pp over a classification with Sentinel-2 data only. An addition of further Sentinel-1 scenes showed no improvement in overall accuracy. The strongest improvement in class-specific accuracy was achieved for paddy fields. This study shows for the first time how land use and land cover classifications in cloud-prone monsoon regions with small-scale agriculture and multiple cropping patterns can be improved by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

AB Remote sensing performed from space carriers for the needs of agriculture as a modern and effective source of informationon occurrence and quality of agricultural crops is presented in the paper.  Processing technology is presented by which the results were obtained for the first time from the agricultural application of remote sensing through satellite under the Czechoslovak conditions.  The data obtained by the scanner, the Thematic Mapper type, at the Landsat satellite on August 24, 1987 were used in the study.  The investigated territory consisted of the area of 15 x 15 km which is farming by the Cooperative Farm,,Mir" Brezuvky, the Zlin district.  The crop rotating plan and additional information of an agronomist were used as supporting data.  The data were processed by a digital system and the method of pattern analysis was used.  The satellite data processing resulted in the thematic map of the topical situation of a crop cover of the territory under study.  Precision was evaluated visually and statistically.  It was found out that statellite apparatus with spatial distinguishing power about 30 m may be used to solve inventory account tasks and also to study the quality of some agricultural crops.  To obtain this result, it is necessary to have an access to the satellite measuring of the suitable time and ground observations.  Field survey is to be directed on the study of phenomena of interest.  This information can be used also to classify another territories with similar natural conditions and to study time changes in the territory under study.

AB The ongoing advancements in deep learning, and exemplary results obtained for different problems using spatio-temporal satellite images, have made deep neural networks quite popular for analysing Earth Observation data. The deep learning models have the capability to learn complex features from the dataset available, and specific to the problem at hand. In this research, the aim is to classify field parcels in images from the Sentinel-2A satellite and identify the corresponding crops using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To obtain a good classification network, the mandatory requirement is clean and reliably labelled data, which is a challenging task in real world applications. What if the labels are not reliable due to manual errors or due to the complexity of annotating data?
   The purpose of this project is to design a pipeline to verify the reliability of the data with minimum supervision and then, use the clean data to train the network for the classification problem at hand. Experiments on different crop types (Wheat, Maize, and Legumes) have shown excellent results in distinguishing a variety from others. The pixel-level classifier model not only allows training of the model with limited available data but also gives an advantage of further analysing the crop area on a sub-parcel level. The proposed approach for detection and classification of vegetation types creates a new possibility in handling Big Data in the domain of Earth Observation with a multitude of potential applications in the areas of precision and smart agriculture, pre-emptive forest management, health monitoring, and damage assessment. The presented pipeline shows the significance of data verification and provides an efficient way to create models by optimizing the efforts, and the time of both engineers and experts.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Recognizing different types of crops trough satellite imagery is an important application of Digital Image Processing in Agriculture. A supervised algorithm for identifying different types of crops is proposed. In the training stage, the studied images are preprocessed using a bilateral filter, and then the histogram of intensity levels is constructed for every crop class. The segmentation stage begins with the assignment of the likelihood of each pixel to belong to each class, which is based on the histogram information. Finally the segmentation is obtained using Gauss-Markov Measure Field. For this research Landsat-5 TM satellite images are used. The experimental work included synthetic and real images. In the case of the real image, the ground truth image was given by an expert. The results of the proposed algorithm were compared with other methods such as Maximum likelihood, Fisher linear likelihood, and Minimum Euclidean distance, among others.

AB The aim of this paper is to map agricultural crops by classifying satellite image time series. Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The threelevel label hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN), such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g., apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km x 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116 ' 000 individual fields spanning 48 crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines, including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions. The hierarchical approach performs superior by at least 9.9 percentage points in F1-score.

AB The task of crop type classification with multitemporal imagery is nowadays often done applying classifiers that are originally developed for single images like support vector machines (SVM). These approaches do not model temporal dependencies in an explicit way. Existing approaches that make use of temporal dependencies are in most cases quite simple and based on rules. Approaches that integrate temporal dependencies to statistical models are very rare and at an early stage of development. Here our approach CRFmulti, based on conditional random fields (CRF), should make a contribution. Conditional random fields consider context knowledge among neighboring primitives in the same way as Markov random fields (MRF) do. Furthermore conditional random fields handle the feature vectors of the neighboring primitives and not only the class labels. Additional to taking spatial context into account, we present an approach for multitemporal data processing where a temporal association potential has been integrated to the common CRF approach to model temporal dependencies. The classification works on pixel-level using spectral image features, whereas all available single images are taken separately. For our experiments a high resolution RapidEye satellite data set of 2010 consisting of 4 images made during the whole vegetation period from April to October is taken. Six crop type categories are distinguished, namely grassland, corn, winter crop, rapeseed, root crops and other crops. To evaluate the potential of the new conditional random field approach the classification result is compared to a manual reference on pixel-and on object-level. Additional a SVM approach is applied under the same conditions and should serve as a benchmark.

AB Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172% and 137% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91% in the western-most field to approximately 70% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.

AB Meeting the food and nutritional demands of ever growing human population will cause immense pressure on agricultural lands and natural resource bases across the world. This challenge can be met only by proper land and water management, which consists of crucial components like understanding cropping systems and crop fallow dynamics for sustainable intensification. In this work, a methodology was developed for crop and crop fallow land estimation using multi-temporal, high spatial resolution Sentinel-2A data in a test site of Odisha state, in India, comprising of two districts i.e., Bhadrak and Jajpur. Customized codes were written to find temporal variation pattern of NDVI values for each pixel in the study area. Observing the variation of NDVI over time, we have attempted to estimate crop life cycle duration and their type with rigorous field inputs. The cropland and fallow land intensification maps showed 10-different cropping pattern with classification accuracy of 83.33%, and kappa coefficient of 0.81. We observed that (1) kharif is the major crop in the study area, while rabi mainly grows in areas where external fresh water sources are available (2) a large portion of the area remains fallow for most part of the year as mapped from Sentinel 2A data. There is scope to utilise the fallow lands for multi-cropping with appropriate land and water management, through the government policy prescriptions. With Sentinel-2B sensor now on board, the temporal resolution of satellite-2 (2A and 2B combined) could improve leading to improved classification and upgradation of the algorithm followed here.

AB Crop type mapping is relevant to a wide range of food security applications. Supervised classification methods commonly generate these data from satellite image time-series. Yet, their successful implementation is hindered by the lack of training samples. Solutions like transfer learning, development of temporal-spectral signatures of the target classes, re-utilization of existing inventories, or crowdsourcing initiatives are commonly applied to generate samples for thematically coarser classifications. These methods are rarely used for generating crop types samples. In this study, we leverage the phenology information of existing data inventories using Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) to address the problem of automatic crop sample generation in two target areas. Resulting labeled samples are refined using proximity measures obtained from Random Forests (RF). Sentinel-2 time-series are used to obtain phenology information from two study areas. The proposed methodology achieved promising results for classes with a reduced inter-classes similarity such as sugar beets (user's accuracy, UA, of 98% and producer's accuracy, PA, of 100%) or grains (UA of 98% and PA of 90%). The crops with a high inter-classes similarity yielded less satisfactory results. Potatoes, for example, obtained a high PA of 95%, but a UA of only 36% because of the spectral-temporal similarity with maize. The methodology works well for areas with balanced crop samples. Yet, it favors prevalent classes in areas with imbalanced crops at the expense of a low accuracy for the minority crops. Despite these shortcomings, the proposed methodology offers a viable option to generate crop samples in regions with few ground labels.

AB The foundation of contemporary weed management practices in many parts of the world is glyphosate. However, dependency on the effectiveness of herbicide practices has led to overuse through continuous growth of crops resistant to a single mode of action. In order to provide a cost-effective weed management strategy that does not promote glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes, differences between resistant and susceptible biotypes have to be identified accurately in the field conditions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted thermal and multispectral remote sensing has potential for detecting biophysical characteristics of weed biotypes during the growing season, which includes distinguishing glyphosate-susceptible and glyphosate-resistant weed populations based on canopy temperature and deep learning driven weed identification algorithms. The objective of this study was to identify herbicide resistance after glyphosate application in true field conditions by analyzing the UAV-acquired thermal and multispectral response of kochia, waterhemp, redroot pigweed, and common ragweed. The data were processed in ArcGIS for raster classification as well as spectral comparison of glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible weeds. The classification accuracy between the sensors and classification methods of maximum likelihood, random trees, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The random trees classifier performed the best at 4 days after application (DAA) for kochia with 62.9% accuracy. The maximum likelihood classifier provided the highest performing result out of all classification methods with an accuracy of 75.2%. A commendable classification was made at 8 DAA where the random trees classifier attained an accuracy of 87.2%. However, thermal reflectance measurements as a predictor for glyphosate resistance within weed populations in field condition was unreliable due to its susceptibility to environmental conditions. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a composite reflectance of 842 nm, 705 nm, and 740 nm wavelength managed to provide better classification results than thermal in most cases.

AB The aim of this study was to clarify the distribution of irrigated drylands in arid and semi-arid areas, where complex terrain, diverse crops and staggered cultivated lands exist. This paper studied the classification methods of irrigated drylands based on temperature, precipitation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from Landsat data in the one-harvest area of the northern Loess Plateau of China by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. An extraction method was proposed for irrigated drylands in arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China. In addition, the change types of irrigated and rainfed drylands in the two periods were classified, and a method was also put forward to directly classify the change types by using the image differences between the two periods combined with the classification results of each period. It was found that combining the ratio of NDVI and NDWI with the accumulated values of temperature and precipitation of the 30 days before imaging could effectively improve the classification accuracy. Moreover, directly classifying the gaps of remote sensing factors in the time dimension before combining spatial clustering information could yield a more accurate type of change, because the accumulation of errors in the change maps obtained from the overlay analysis of distribution maps of the two periods could be avoided. The accuracy of classification could be improved by introducing the dynamic information of time dimension into the classification of historical periods. This study complements the extraction method for this type of irrigated dryland, and the classification results can improve the accuracy of existing products in terms of spatial resolution, which can fill the shortage of detailed distribution data for irrigated and rainfed drylands in this region.

TI Assessing of Urban Vegetation Biomass in Combination with LiDAR and
   High-resolution Remote Sensing Images
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB The urban vegetation ecosystem is a vegetation ecosystem that is deeply influenced by human beings. The rapid urbanization process brings a great influence on the growth environment of urban vegetation. Urban vegetation has a certain mitigating effect on the urbanization process. It is irreplaceable by other urban ecosystems in functions such as maintaining atmospheric carbon-oxygen balance, reducing heat island effects, purifying, and beautifying the urban environment. At present, the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) mainly focuses on the original forest, grassland, desertification vegetation and crops, and the data sources are mostly medium- and low-resolution data such as Land Remote-Sensing Satellite Thematic Map (Landsat TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Compared with the research objects such as forest and grassland, urban vegetation has higher heterogeneity of underlying surface within the city scope, and there are more mixed pixels of medium- and low-resolution data. Therefore, high-resolution data are needed for classification and estimation. This study uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to expand the sample size, combines high-resolution image data to classify urban vegetation areas, and quantitatively estimates and inverts biomass. The spatial and temporal variation of urban vegetation biomass was analysed by comparing the inversion accuracy of five different models and the advantages and disadvantages of the research models. The research results show that: (1) In the absence of urban forest sample points, the biomass background data are expanded with the help of LiDAR data and more data is provided for further inversion; (2) Through five model method comparison experiments, the optimal method for estimation is based on the Random Forest (RF) model; (3) Analysed the changes of urban vegetation in the study area in the past 10 years, the development of different types of urban vegetation has experienced a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. Due to the high heterogeneity of features in urban areas, this study improved the inversion accuracy of estimating urban vegetation biomass by classification, and provided reference value and the basis for urban ecological management and regional planning.

AB With the increasing of satellite sensors, more available multi-source data can be used for large-scale high-precision crop classification. Both polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) and multi-spectral optical data have been widely used for classification. However, it is difficult to combine the covariance matrix of PolSAR data with the spectral bands of optical data. Using Hoekman's method, this study solves the above problems by transforming the covariance matrix to an intensity vector that includes multiple intensity values on different polarization basis. In order to reduce the features redundancy, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is adopted to select some useful polarimetric and optical features. In this study, the PolSAR data acquired by satellite Gaofen-3 (GF-3) on 19 July 2017 and the optical data acquired by Sentinel-2A on 17 July 2017 over the Dongting lake basin are selected for the validation experiment. The results show that the full feature integration method proposed in this study achieves an overall classification accuracy of 85.27%, higher than that of the single dataset method or some other feature integration modes.

AB Understanding irrigation expansion and its implications on water availability is critical for development of decision support tools for sustainable water resources planning. Irrigation expansion in the Lake Tana Basin of Ethiopia from 1986 to 2016 was examined using image classification from thematic maps and remote sensing imagery (Landsat5-8 TM/ETM+, OLI). The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) imagery was used to identify irrigated cropland based on greenness. Irrigation water consumption was determined by calculating irrigation water requirements of the major crops grown with irrigation and using the estimated irrigated land size of the basin. Irrigated croplands have increased in area from 55 to 65 % in the last past 30 years (from 1986 to 2016). The classification obtained is accurate to the level of 89.6% and Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The Landsat imagery is useful in tracking of the spatiotemporal patterns of irrigated croplands for water management purposes, especially in data deficient areas dotted sparsely by small holder irrigated farms. The results indicated that irrigation consumption in the basin increased from 0.380 km(3) year(-1) in 1986 to 0.798 km(3) year(-1) in 2016. It is found that the available water cannot sustain the projected irrigation expansion unless alternative water sources are found. Also, more precise irrigation technologies have to be implemented to minimize water losses.

AB Remote Sensing plays very important role in many different study fields, like hydrology, crop management, environmental and ecosystem studies. For all mentioned areas of interest different remote sensing and image processing techniques, such as: image classification (object and pixel-based), object identification, change detection, etc. can be applied. Most of this techniques use spectral reflectance coefficients as the basis for the identification and distinction of different objects and materials, e.g. monitoring of vegetation stress, identification of water pollutants, yield identification, etc. Spectral characteristics are usually acquired using discrete methods such as spectrometric measurements in both laboratory and field conditions. Such measurements however can be very time consuming, which has led many international researchers to investigate the reliability and accuracy of using image-based methods. According to published and ongoing studies, in order to acquire these spectral characteristics from images, it is necessary to have hyperspectral data. The presented article describes a series of experiments conducted using the push-broom Headwall MicroHyperspec A-series VNIR. This hyperspectral scanner allows for registration of images with more than 300 spectral channels with a 1.9 nm spectral bandwidth in the 380-1000 nm range. The aim of these experiments was to establish a methodology for acquiring spectral reflectance characteristics of different forms of land cover using such sensor. All research work was conducted in controlled conditions from low altitudes. Hyperspectral images obtained with this specific type of sensor requires a unique approach in terms of post-processing, especially radiometric correction. Large amounts of acquired imagery data allowed the authors to establish a new post-processing approach. The developed methodology allowed the authors to obtain spectral reflectance coefficients from a hyperspectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, ensuring a high accuracy of obtained data.

AB Accurate and reliable information on Spatio-temporal extent of surface water is critical for various agriculture/environmental applications such as drought, flood monitoring, and understanding the availability of surface water for irrigation. Remote sensing (Optical as well as SAR) datasets are extremely useful to monitor surface water at massive scale. In monsoon months the optical remote sensing observations over semi-arid Indian sub-continent are obstructed due to cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a useful alternative for year-round monitoring of the surface water bodies. Sentinel-1A and 1B are very useful to monitor the changes at very high spatial resolution and frequently due to its high spatiotemporal resolution. The main objective is to establish an operational methodology for estimation of spatiotemporal variations in the surface water availability using Sentinel-1A and 1B observations. The study has been carried out in four districts of Coastal Andhra Pradesh, India viz. Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari, and West Godavari. Training data for water vs. non-water (vegetation, forest, settlements, and barren lands) classes have been obtained from field visits and high-resolution Google Map overlay in Google Earth Engine. We divided the dataset into 70% data for model training and 30% for validation and evaluated the performance of tuned random forest classifier on the validation dataset. Results show the classification accuracy of 94.32%. Further, current and historical weather observations such as rainfall were used to assess the validity of spatiotemporal surface water layers. We found a good agreement between the rainfall and surface water availability. We observed the increase in the surface water area during July-August months due to rainfall as well as flooding in the rice fields during transplanting. We propose to use the crop area map, spatiotemporal surface water layers and weather observations for drought assessment i.e., historical drought events and areas prone to agricultural drought.

AB A comparison of agricultural crop maps from independent field-based classifications of the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 4 multispectral (XS), SPOT5 XS, IKONOS XS, QuickBird XS and QuickBird pan-sharpened (PS) images is presented. An agricultural area within the north-west section of Turkey was analysed for field-based crop identification. The SPOT4 XS, SPOT5 XS, IKONOS XS and QuickBird images were collected in similar climatic conditions during July and August 2004. The classification of each image was carried out separately on a per-field basis on all bands and the coincident bands that are green, red and near-infrared (NIR). To examine the effect of filtering on field-based classification, the images were each filtered using the 3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7 and 9 x 9 mean filter and the filtered bands were also classified on per-field basis. For the unfiltered images, IKONOS XS provided the highest overall accuracies of 88.9% and 88.1% for the all-bands and the coincident bands classifications, respectively. On average, IKONOS XS performed slightly better than QuickBird XS and QuickBird PS, while it outperformed SPOT4 XS and SPOT5 XS. The use of filtered images in field-based classification reduced the accuracies for SPOT4 XS, SPOT5 XS, IKONOS XS and QuickBird XS. The results of this study indicate that smoothing images prior to classification does not improve the accuracies for the field-based classification. On the contrary, the accuracies for the filtered QuickBird PS images indicated a slight improvement. On the whole, both IKONOS and QuickBird images produced quite promising results for field-based crop mapping, yielding overall accuracies above 83%.

To incorporate dependency of crops in different variables namely, texture, phenological, parent material and soil, soil moisture, topographic, vegetation, and climate, 35 digital layers are prepared using different satellite data (ALOS DEM, Landsat-8, MODIS NDVI, RISAT-1, and Sentinel-1A) and climatic data (precipitation and temperature). The importance of variables is also calculated based on mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in Gini score. Importance and capabilities of variables for crop mapping have been discussed. Variables associated with spectral responses have shown greater importance in comparison to topographic and climate variables. The spectral range (0.85 to 0.88 mu m) of the near-infrared band is the most useful variable with the highest scores. The topographic variable and elevation have secured the second place rank in the both scores. This indicates the importance of spectral responses as well as of topography in model development. Climate variables have not shown as much importance as others, but in association with others, they cause a decrease in the out of bag (OOB) error rate. In addition to the OOB data, a 20% independent dataset of training samples is used to evaluate RF model. Results showthatRF has good capability for crop classification.

AB Many approaches for land cover classification rely on the spectral characteristics of the elements on the surface using one single multispectral image. Some land cover elements, as the vegetation and, in particular crops, are changing over seasons and over the growing cycle and may be characterized by their spectral temporal variability. In such cases, the spectral temporal variability can be used to model the crop's phenology and predict the crop type using both spatial and temporal spectral data. In this paper we aim to exploit the temporal dimension on the crop type classification using multi-temporal multispectral data and machine learning techniques. The high revisiting frequency of Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities on the exploitation of high temporal resolution multispectral data. In this investigation, we evaluated the K - nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) methods, for mapping 18 summer crops using Sentinel-2 data. Each method was applied to three different combinations of bands: a) all Sentinel-2 spectral bands (except band 10); b) vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI), Water Indices (NDWI, NDWI2, Moisture Index) and Normalized Image Indices and Brightness and c) the combination of the spectral bands and the indices. The best precisions we achieved were 98,6% with KNN, 98,9% with RF and 98.0% using a DT.

AB The operational land imager (OLI) is the latest instrument in the Landsat series of satellite imagery, which officially began normal operations on 30 May 2013. The OLI includes two bands that are not on the thematic mapper series of sensors aboard Landsat-5 and 7; a cirrus band and a coastal/aerosol band. This paper compares the classification and regression tree and the kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) for mapping crops in Hokkaido, Japan, using OLI data, except the cirrus band and the pan band. The OLI data acquired on 8 July 2013 was used for crop classification of beans, beets, grassland, maize, potatoes and winter wheat. The KELM algorithm performed better in this study and achieved overall accuracies of 90.1%. According to the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distances, the short wavelength infrared band provides the greater contribution (the highest value was observed for band 6 in OLI data).

AB Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) measurements have been utilized to derive land-use patterns from a supervised multi-spectral classification. Independently, the water use of crops, perennial vegetation, surface water impoundments, and barren land has been assessed using a radiation and energy balance approach using the same Landsat images. The land-use classification had an overall accuracy of 85%, which is acceptable for a heterogeneous tropical watershed with abundant small-scale landscape features. Actual evaporation of the various land use types was verified on physical consistency by applying the inverse Penman-Monteith equation, taking the evaporation estimations from remote sensing as input. The surface resistance to evaporation was found to be similar to resistances experimentally obtained elsewhere, but in similar climatic conditions. A new calculation procedure for time integration of actual evaporation under conditions of very limited surface observations is outlined and applied to the 26,000-ha Kirindi Oya watershed in southern Sri Lanka. The annual watershed evaporation deviated 4% from evaporation derived as the residual water balance term. This new technique, based on Landsat measurements, helps in identifying the evaporative depletion of various land-use categories, which is an important input for water management evaluation procedures. The major finding is that a significant amount of irrigation water is used by the perennial vegetation in the vicinity of the irrigation systems.

AB Supervised classification algorithms require a sufficiently large set of representative training samples to generate accurate land-cover maps. Collecting reference data is difficult, expensive, and unfeasible at the large scale. To solve this problem, this article introduces a novel approach that aims to extract reliable labeled data from existing thematic products. Although these products represent a potentially useful information source, their use is not straightforward. They are not completely reliable since they may present classification errors. They are typically aggregated at polygon level, where polygons do not necessarily correspond to homogeneous areas. Finally, usually, there is a semantic gap between map legends and remote sensing (RS) data. In this context, we propose an approach that aims to: 1) perform a domain understanding to detect the discrepancies between the thematic map domain and the RS data domain; 2) use RS data contemporary to the map to decompose the thematic product from the semantic and spatial viewpoints; and 3) extract a database of informative and reliable training samples. The database of weak labeled units is used for training an ensemble of classifiers on recent data whose results are then combined in a majority voting rule. Two sets of experimental results obtained on MS images by extracting training samples from a crop type map and the 2018 Corine Land Cover (CLC) map, respectively, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Although Rwanda has accomplished significant improvements in food production in recent years, one fifth of its population remains food insecure. Agricultural information is currently collected through seasonal agricultural surveys, but more frequent and timely data collection is needed to adequately inform public and private decision-makers about the status of crops during the growing season. Sentinel-1 and -2 data are freely available with new images provided every 4-5 days. While analysis of these multispectral images has been used for agricultural applications, there are few applications to smallholder agriculture. Major challenges for satellite image analysis in the context of Rwanda include heavily clouded scenes and small plot sizes that are often intercropped. Sentinel-2 scenes corresponding to mid-season were analyzed, and spectral signatures of maize could be distinguished from those of other crops. Seasonal mean filtering was applied to Sentinel-1 scenes, and there was significant overlap in the spectral signatures across different types of vegetation. Random Forest models for classification of Sentinel scenes were developed using a training dataset that was constructed from high-resolution multispectral images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in several different locations in Rwanda and labeled as to the crop type by trained observers. The models were applied to satellite images of the whole country of Rwanda and validated using a test dataset from the UAV images. The Sentinel-2 model had the user's accuracy for maize classification of 75%, while the Sentinel-1 model overestimated the maize area resulting in a user's accuracy of <50%.

AB The main objective of this study was to use a short time series image data extract the paddy field spatial information effectively. For this purpose, this paper put forward a method of extracting paddy field by combining multi-temporal remote sensing images. In this paper, the Multi-temporal GF-1 of Jiang Ning District in Nanjing where planting a large number of rice was used as the study data. Then the datasets for the rice extraction were constructed with two parts covering the growth cycle of rice, one is the multiband reflectance(MBR) with their derivative features (WDRVI and NDWI) of GF-1 images. Besides, the Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Machine classification approach (PSO-SVM) was introduced to extract paddy field by comparing with the mainstream classifier such as maximum likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF). and Neural Net (NN). The results show that the combination of MBR, NDWI, WDRVI is the best performance in which the rice extraction accuracy reach 93.44 and the average accuracy, overall accuracy and Kappa's coefficient reach 94.42, 94.66 and 92.92 percent respectively. As the results indicated, the method proposed by this paper has a good performance which not only extract the distribution information of rice but also provide the reference value for the classification of other crops of urban agriculture.

AB This paper aims to develop a method to assess regional water balances using remote sensing techniques. The Boufakrane river watershed in Meknes Region (Morocco), which is characterized by both a strong urbanization and a rural land use change, is taken as a study case. Firstly, changes in land cover were mapped by classifying remote sensing images (Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager) at a medium scale resolution for the years 1990, 2003 and 2018. By means of supervised classification procedures the following land cover categories could be mapped: forests, bare soil, arboriculture, arable land and urban area. For each of these categories a water balance was developed for the different time periods, taking into account changing management and consumption patterns. Finally, the land cover maps were combined with the land cover specific water balances resulting in a total water balance for the selected catchment. The procedure was validated by comparing the assessments with data from water supply stations and the number of licensed ground water extraction pumps. In terms of land use/land cover changes (LULCC), the results showed that urban areas, natural vegetation, arboriculture and cereals increased by 183.74%, 12.55%, 34.99 and 48.77% respectively while forests and bare soils decreased by 78.65% and 16.78% respectively. On the other hand, water consumption has been increased significantly due to the Meknes city growth, the arboriculture expansion and the new crops' introduction in the arable areas. The increased water consumption by human activities is largely due to reduced water losses through evapotranspiration because of deforestation. Since the major part of the forest in the catchment has disappeared, a further increase of the water consumption by human activities can no longer be offset by deforestation.

AB We examined the use of data from low resolution (MODIS) and almost high resolution (ASTER) sensors for crop acreage estimation in south of Iran (Marvdasht county). The feasibility of these data for the task was determined. The results are based on satellite and ground truth data. We show that MODIS images provide reasonable accuracy for crop area estimation. Because of sub-pixel heterogeneity using the combined dataset (high and low resolution) retrieval accuracy is better than with high temporal or high resolution images. So we examined the potential of sub-pixel classification for regional crop area estimation using time series of NDVI of MODIS images instead of MVC-NDVI in this paper. Support vector machine approach used for classification high resolution image and Neural Network model was investigated and results in area fraction images (AFIs). The algorithm was trained with both of reference data and in situ data which collected by GPS in Marvdasht District. For the major classes (winter wheat, maize and other crops) the obtained acreage estimates showed good agreement with the true values (R-2 approximate to:80%). The method seems attractive for wide-scale, regional area estimation in the countries that appropriate data are not available.

AB Global warming has become one of the world's most serious social issues. Nitrogenous fertilizer, which is generally used for agricultural activity, is a major source of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Investigating the distribution of crop fields is thus essential to controlling greenhouse gases. Analyses using remotely sensed data such as aerial photos and satellite images can be more cost-effective and reliable for large agricultural areas. Classification techniques that use multi-date satellite images are efficient tools for identifying agricultural land. In this study, image co-registration between images from different dates is performed for preprocessing.
   The Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) atmospheric correction technique is applied to convert radiance data in the satellite image to reflectance data. We then analyze and compare several vegetation indices using separability analysis. Rice fields are classified using the composition of the multi-temporal satellite image and the most efficient vegetation index. The extracted rice fields are compared with reference data derived from aerial photo interpretation. The classification results provided agricultural accuracies of approximately 90%. In addition, the extracted rice fields had acceptable producer and user accuracies of 83% and 78% respectively in Daejeon and 80% and 72% respectively in Gongju.

AB Rido fia segetum Moris is an umbelliferous weed, which is very frequent and persistent in most sunflower crops in Spain. The hyperspectral signatures of bare soil and sunflower and Ridolfa segetum at different phenological stages (from emergency to senescence) were collected at three dates (mid-May, mid-June and mid-July 2003) using a handheld field spectroradiometer and, lately, were analysed to select the wavelength, bands and vegetation indices for hyperspectral and multispectral discrimination within and between phenological stages of sunflower and R. segetum. Simultaneously to the field measurements, conventional-color and color-infrared aerial photographs of two fields located in Cordoba province were captured, and remote sensing techniques were applied to map Rido fia segetum patches in sunflower. Two methods of classification (Spectral Angle Mapper and Class Separation) were checked and the confusion matrix was used to determine the accuracy of the weed maps. In the multispectral study, the highest different was obtained in mid-June. In mid-July, the ANVI index [(NIR-B)/(NIR+B)] showed statistical differences between bare soil, R. segetum and all corresponding sunflower phenological stages, but these results were not completely similar in the aerial photograph analysis. The Spectral Angle Mapper classification of the mid-June photographs permitted the discrimination of R. segetum patches in sunflower with the highest accuracy (over 90%).

AB Locating and forecasting water needs can assist the location of water in dry regions, and improve the management of reservoirs and the canal network. Satellite, ground data, and agrometeorological data were combined to forecast the volume of irrigation water needed during 1993 and 1994 in an irrigation district of 327 km(2) located in the Ebro basin, Spain. The main crops were rice, alfalfa plus forage, winter cereals (barley and wheat), sunflower and maize. Their extent was estimated every year by frame area sampling and a regression estimator with satellite data. Initial crop area statistics were obtained by expansion of the sample areas to the entire study area and then a regression estimator with the multitemporal supervised classification of two Landsat-5 TM images was applied. This procedure improved the precision of the estimates by expansion. Net water requirements (m(3) ha(-1)) of the above mentioned crops were computed from reference evapotranspiration estimates, crop coefficients and effective precipitation. These computations were performed for an average year, i.e. by using long-term averaged meteorological data. Crop hectarage and net crop water requirements were multiplied to obtain, for the entire study area, the volume (hm(3) = 10(6) m(3)) of the net crop water requirements. After subtraction of water taken directly from the rivers and non-productive sunflower, the irrigation water volumes were estimated. The comparison of these forecasts with the volumes of water invoiced by the Ebro Basin Water Authority confirmed the feasibility of forecasting the volume of water applied to an individual irrigation district. This is an objective and practical method for estimating the irrigation water volume applied in an irrigated area.

AB Satellite remote sensing data can provide timely, accurate, and objective information on cultivated area by crop type and, in turn, facilitate accurate estimates of crop production. Here, we present a generic multi-resolution approach to sample-based crop type area estimation at the national level using soybean as an example crop type. Historical MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data were used to stratify growing regions into subsets of low, medium and high soybean cover. A stratified random sample of 20 km x 20 km sample blocks was selected and Landsat data for these sample blocics classified into soybean cover. The Landsat-derived soybean area was used to produce national estimates of soybean area. Current year MODIS-indicated soybean cover served as an auxiliary variable in a stratified regression estimator procedure. To evaluate the approach, we prototyped the method in the USA, where the 2013 USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) was used as a reference training data set for mapping soybean cover within each sample block. Three individual Landsat images were sufficient to accurately map soybean cover for all blocics, revealing that a rather sparse sample of phenological variation is needed to separate soybean from other cover types. In addition to stacks of images, we also evaluated standard radiometrically normalized Landsat inputs for mapping blocks individually (local-scale) and all at once (national-scale). All tested inputs resulted in area estimates comparable to the official USDA estimate of 30.86 Mha, with lower accuracy and higher standard error for national-scale mapping implementations. The stratified regression estimator incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soy reduced the standard error of the estimated soybean area by over 25% relative to the standard error of the stratified estimator. Finally, the method was ported to Argentina. A stratified random sample of blocks was characterized for soybean cultivated area using stacks of individual Landsat images for the 2013-2014 southern hemisphere growing season. A sub sample of these blocks was visited on the ground to assess the accuracy of the Landsat-derived soy classification. The stratified regression estimator procedure performed similarly to the US application as it resulted in a reduction in standard error of about 25% relative to the stratified estimator not incorporating current year MODIS-indicated soybean. Our final estimated soybean area was 28% lower than that reported by the USDA, corresponding to a 20% field-based omission error related to underdeveloped fields. Lessons learned from this study can be ported to other regions of comparable field size and management intensity to assess soybean cultivated area.

AB African highland agro-ecosystems are dominated by small-scale agricultural fields that often contain a mix of annual and perennial crops. This makes such systems difficult to map by remote sensing. We developed an expert Bayesian network model to extract the small-scale coffee fields of Rwanda from very high resolution data. The model was subsequently applied to aerial orthophotos covering more than 99% of Rwanda and on one QuickBird image for the remaining part. The method consists of a stepwise adjustment of pixel probabilities, which incorporates expert knowledge on size of coffee trees and fields, and on their location. The initial naive Bayesian network, which is a spectral-based classification, yielded a coffee map with an overall accuracy of around 50%. This confirms that standard spectral variables alone cannot accurately identify coffee fields from high resolution images. The combination of spectral and ancillary data (DEM and a forest map) allowed mapping of coffee fields and associated uncertainties with an overall accuracy of 87%. Aggregated to district units, the mapped coffee areas demonstrated a high correlation with the coffee areas reported in the detailed national coffee census of 2009 (R-2 = 0.92). Unlike the census data our map provides high spatial resolution of coffee area patterns of Rwanda. The proposed method has potential for mapping other perennial small scale cropping systems in the East African Highlands and elsewhere. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate information on crop distribution and its changes is important for food security and environmental management. Although time series analysis is a widely-used and useful tool to characterize the seasonal dynamics of crops, the traditional image stacking approach misses important phenological events. This condition makes it difficult to identify the spectral and temporal features that are potentially important for crop identification, and therefore, makes it difficult to determine the optimal feature inputs for classifying crops with both high accuracy and low computation time. To address this gap, we developed a method to automatically select the spectro-temporal features by mining crop phenology information so as to improve the accuracy of crop classifications. This method of Phenology-based Spectral and Temporal Feature Selection (PSTFS) contains two major components: to identify the features with the highest separability between each pair of classes, and to prune redundant features to retain the best for classification. Using this optimal set of features and support vector machines (SVMs), we generated a high-quality corn cultivation map of China's Heilongjiang Province for 2011. The corn map had accuracies greater than 85% and agreed well with the corn census areas. We also demonstrate the goodness of this method for selecting features with high interpretability: it identified two phenological stages (three leaf and milky mature) that could best separate corn from other land use classes in the region. Our approach indicates the great potential for using the PSTFS method in conjunction with SVM classifiers to accurately map crop types based on satellite time series data.

AB The objective of this research is to detect seasonal agricultural land use and cropping pattern of irrigated crops during the 2017/2018 growing season in the Mujib basin in Jordan. The Mujib basin is considered as one of the major sources for water production in Jordan, while the agricultural production is the main consumer sector for water in the basin. High multi-temporal multi-spectral resolutions Sentinel-2b satellite images were used to identify the land use types using the supervised classification that applied on spring and summer growing season. The results show that the temporal NDVI curve is very useful in distinguishing between different crops type with high details, and is used in assisting the agricultural land use pattern. Multi-temporal NDVI images were used to identify the cropping pattern within the agricultural land using the unsupervised classification approach. The results show that the rainfed agriculture is confined in the high rainfall zones with one period of growing season, while the irrigated agricultural crops are spreading in the basin over the whole year with different periods of growing seasons. Irrigated vegetables and tree crops are the dominant agricultural crops in the basin with more than 70% of cultivated land. Most of the irrigated vegetables and trees are grown in the summer seasons under high temperatures conditions which consumes the highest percentage of irrigated water. These results show that the patterns of agricultural land use under Dryland regions are very essential issue in determining water consumption and management alternatives.

AB Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of priorities the United Nations and World Bank have set for countries to reach in order to improve quality of life and environment globally by 2030. Free satellite images have been identified as a key resource that can be used to produce official statistics and analysis to measure progress towards SDGs, especially those that are concerned with the physical environment, such as forest, water, and crops. Satellite images can often be unusable due to missing data from cloud cover, particularly in tropical areas where the deforestation rates are high. There are existing methods for filling in image gaps; however, these are often computationally expensive in image classification or not effective at pixel scale. To address this, we use two machine learning methods-gradient boosted machine and random forest algorithms-to classify the observed and simulated missing' pixels in satellite images as either grassland or woodland. We also predict a continuous biophysical variable, Foliage Projective Cover (FPC), which was derived from satellite images, and perform accurate binary classification and prediction using only the latitude and longitude of the pixels. We compare the performance of these methods against each other and inverse distance weighted interpolation, which is a well-established spatial interpolation method. We find both of the machine learning methods, particularly random forest, perform fast and accurate classifications of both observed and missing pixels, with up to 0.90 accuracy for the binary classification of pixels as grassland or woodland. The results show that the random forest method is more accurate than inverse distance weighted interpolation and gradient boosted machine for prediction of FPC for observed and missing data. Based on the case study results from a sub-tropical site in Australia, we show that our approach provides an efficient alternative for interpolating images and performing land cover classifications.

AB Satellite-based wetland mapping faces challenges due to the high spatial heterogeneity and dynamic characteristics of seasonal wetlands. Although normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (NTS) shows great potential in land cover mapping and crop classification, the effectiveness of various NTS with different spatial and temporal resolution has not been evaluated for seasonal wetland classification. To address this issue, we conducted comparisons of those NTS, including the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NTS with 500m resolution, NTS fused with MODIS and Landsat data (MOD_LC8-NTS), and HJ-1 NDVI compositions (HJ-1-NTS) with finer resolution, for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. Results showed the following: (1) the NTS with finer resolution was more effective in the classification of seasonal wetlands than that of the MODIS-NTS with 500-m resolution and (2) generally, the HJ-1-NTS performed better than that of the fused NTS, with an overall accuracy of 88.12% for HJ-1-NTS and 83.09% for the MOD_LC8-NTS. Future work should focus on the construction of satellite image time series oriented to highly dynamic characteristics of seasonal wetlands. This study will provide useful guidance for seasonal wetland classification, and benefit the improvements of spatiotemporal fusion models.

AB In this paper, we explored how aridity influences the regional deforestation and land-use patterns (i.e. crops/pastures) in South American Dry Chaco. To do this, we contrasted land use during last decade (2001-2012) with a spatially explicit aridity index, which we complemented with a crop water balance model. Land-use classifications were performed by considering the temporal variability of NDVI from MODIS satellites, showing that 40 and 60% of deforested land was assigned to crops and pastures, respectively. Results indicate that although the regional deforestation pattern was not associated with the aridity gradient, with drier areas similarly deforested as wetter areas, contrasting differences were observed in the use of this land, with crops mostly located (90%) in wetter areas and pastures evenly distributed across the whole aridity gradient. This research highlighted the strong effect of water limitations on the land-use option after deforestation and may help to set the basis for future land-use planning policies.

AB The agro-industrial production of genetically modified organisms uses great amounts of pesticides, close to cities, which generates growing concern due to the numerous evidence of their negative effects on health and the environment. In a context of the lack, or inaccessibility, of official data on crop dynamics and pesticide use, environmental indicators using satellite data are needed for the proper monitoring of peri-urban areas. The objective of this research is to make a crop proximity index using satellite information to assess and monitor peri-urban agro-industrial activity. Twenty cities in Argentina and ten in the United States were selected. The CPI index is designed to evaluate a city and its peri-urban areas as a whole by taking account of the land uses and factors that can potentially influence the proximity to agro-industrial activity to the population living in those cities. Agriculture factor was weighted by proximity or remoteness using perimeter rings from the urban edge. All the necessary data for the calculation of the CPI index were obtained through the classification and processing of Sentinel 2 satellite images with software and the Google Earth Engine platform. The results show a worrying situation, 90% of cities in Argentina and 80% in the United States have a negative CPI. Most of the cities examined are extremely close to extensive areas of crops, that use a high amount of pesticides and which do not have the protection of trees or buffer zones.

AB This paper includes the mapping of cultivated areas (vineyards) in the experimental zone of the EFEDA project, where vineyard crop is the dominant one. The study area is located in central Spain with a surface area of about 10 km x 10 km and showing important desertification hazards. The objective of the paper is to establish the mapping of vineyard areas by remote sensing techniques and to establish relationships between the spectral signature and agronomical parameters (biomass, percent of cover, etc.). For these objectives, several vegetation classes have been defined (vineyards, cereals, fallow, olives and forest) and multi-temporal Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images were used with the maximum likelihood classification method and masking techniques. The results were checked by ground truth and by existing vegetation cover maps (1: 25 000) and show in general a good correspondence between both information sources. Moreover, these results have permitted to define new vineyard categories like abandoned vineyards and young vineyards that explain the difference between the classification results for vineyards and the ground truth. The later stage of the study pays special attention to the correlation of the agronomical parameters, such as the height of the crop and biomass with the spectral signature of the vineyards represented by the normalized index NDVI, using multi-temporal Landsat images between May and July that comprehend the phenological evolution of the vineyards. Good correlation coefficients (r=0.86 and r=0.90) were obtained successively for the biomass, height and (r=0.82) for the vegetation cover surface. Finally, maps representing the spatial distribution of these parameters were generated for 14 July (period of time when the vineyard is most developed) using the adjustment previously obtained between the NDVI of the vineyard and these parameters.

AB There is a growing demand of the spatial distribution of major crops at the field level in recent years for the precision management of farmlands in developing countries. However, most previous studies used low or medium resolution images (e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) to map the planting areas of rice in various regions of China. As a new source of satellite imagery, the 3 m Planet satellite imagery with daily revisit frequency has rarely been used for mapping crop types. In particular, it is still unclear how well the Planet imagery would perform in mapping the rice planting areas in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Plain of China where image acquisition is strongly limited by rainy and cloudy weather conditions. To overcome the spectral confusion between rice and non-rice vegetation types, this study proposed one-class classification approaches with Planet imagery from the early and late seasons of rice crops over three counties (Guanyun, Rugao and Wujiang) across Jiangsu Province in eastern China. Apart from the traditional use of mono-temporal imagery from the late season (Strategy I), we developed two strategies to make use of the bi-temporal imagery from the early and late seasons, with one being direct classification using stacked images (Strategy II) and the other being stepwise classification (Strategy III). All classifications were performed with the popular machine learning classifier one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and evaluated from the aspects of classification accuracy and area estimation accuracy.
   The results showed Strategy I could achieve an overall classification accuracy of 83.02% and kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.65. The overall accuracy (OA) can be significantly improved by Strategy II (OA = 84.44% and kappa = 0.69) and further by Strategy III (OA = 90.42% and kappa = 0.81). In terms of area estimation, the estimates from Strategy III were consistent with the government reported statistical data with a relative error (RE) within 10% at the county level. At the town level, the correspondence between Planet-derived rice planting areas and the Landsat-8 derived reference data was significantly improved with Strategy III as compared to the other two for Guanyun and Wujiang. The stepwise classification approach (Strategy III) developed with Planet imagery has great values in monitoring rice paddies over the regions with fragmentized distribution of rice fields.

AB Remote sensing (RS) platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an essential source of information in precision agriculture (PA) as they are able to provide images on a daily basis and at a very high resolution. In this framework, this study aims to identify the optimal level of nitrogen (N)-based nutrients for improved productivity in an onion field of "Cipolla Rossa di Tropea" (Tropea red onion). Following an experiment that involved the arrangement of nine plots in the onion field in a randomized complete block design (RCBD), with three replications, three different levels of N fertilization were compared: N150 (150 kg N ha(-1)), N180 (180 kg N ha(-1)), and e N210 (210 kg N ha(-1)). The crop cycle was monitored using multispectral (MS) UAV imagery, producing vigor maps and taking into account the yield of data. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was used to monitor the vigor of the crop. In addition, the coverage's class onion was spatially identified using geographical object-based image classification (GEOBIA), observing differences in SAVI values obtained in plots subjected to differentiated N fertilizer treatment. The information retrieved from the analysis of soil properties (electrical conductivity, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen), yield performance and mean SAVI index data from each field plot showed significant relationships between the different indicators investigated. A higher onion yield was evident in plot N180, in which SAVI values were higher based on the production data.

AB Fuzzy excess green (ExG) crisp indices and clustering algorithms such as the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) have been successfully used for unsupervised classification of hidden and prominent regions of interest (ROI's), namely green plants in crop color images against bare clay soil. corn residue and wheat residue, typical of the Great Plains. Each process can be enhanced with Zadeh (Z) and Gath-Geva (GG) fuzzy enhancement techniques. Enhanced indices and clusters can be then sorted by final degree of fuzziness. and recombined into labeled, false-color class images, which can be used as templates for further shape and textural analyses. ROI's with the lowest degree of fuzziness were consistently found to be plant clusters according to foveated or prominence of the region size within the image. Clustering performance according to partition densities and hyper volume was also evaluated. These latter measures can be used to select the number of clusters and evaluate the computational time needed to find plant ROI's with complex backgrounds under different lighting conditions. Enhanced GK clustering methods have performed very well and have identified plants in bare soil.. corn residue plants, and wheat straw plants, well into the high 90 percentages.. depending on plant age category and the relative proportion of plant size within the image. Improved clustering algorithms with textural finger printing could be potentially useful for unsupervised remote sensing, mapping, crop management, weed, and pest control for precision agriculture.

AB Mastering accurate spatial planting and distribution status of the crops is significantly important for the nation to guide the agricultural production and formulate agricultural policies from a macro perspective. In this paper, the Landsat-8 OLI satellite images were taken as the data sources. And as for the nine crop types within the study area, such as the wheat, rice, and other crops, three classification methods of the random forest classification (RFC), the support vector machine (SVM), and the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) were applied in extracting the planting area of winter wheat in Wushi County of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It can be seen from the results that, general classification accuracy of MLC, SVM, and RFC are respectively 80.58%, 87.95%, and 95.96%, while their Kappa coefficients are respectively 0.61, 0.76, and 0.86. The RFC method shows higher classification accuracy that those of MLC and SVM methods. The principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the original 7-band image to extract the first 4 principal components and calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Meanwhile, the 6 additional auxiliary feature bands were superimposed on the original 7-band images to carry out reclassification, through which, the general accuracy of MLC increased by 3 percent while its Kappa coefficient increased by 0.06; the SVM general accuracy increased by 3.02 percent while its Kappa coefficient increased by 0.13; and the general accuracy of the RFC increased by 0.85 percent while its Kappa coefficient increased by 0.02. This indicates that, the adding of auxiliary information can improve the crop classification and identification ability and accuracy. Based on the comprehensive evaluation, the classification method of random forest is proved to have better performance in winter wheat identification.

AB Plastic greenhouses (PGs) are widely built near cities in China to produce vegetables and fruits. In order to promote sustainable agriculture, rural landscape construction, and better manage water resources, numerous remote sensing methods have been developed to identify and monitor the distribution of PGs, of which many map PGs based on spectral responses and geometric shapes. In this study, we proposed a new fine- and coarse-scale mapping approach using two-temporal Sentinel-2 images with various seasonal characteristics and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). Having applied this approach in a pilot area study, the results were summarized as follows: (1) A time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 images showed that the reflectance of greenhouses changes during crop growth and development. In particular, the red-edge and near-infrared bands undergo a significant increase and then decrease during the whole crop growth period. Thus, two critical period images, containing a substantial difference in greenhouse reflectance, were sufficient to carry out an accurate and efficient mapping result. (2) The 1D-CNN classifier was used to map greenhouses by capturing subtle details and the overall trend of the spectrum curve. Overall, our approach showed higher classification accuracy than other approaches using support vector machines (SVM) or random forests (RF). In addition, the greenhouse area identified was highly consistent with the existing surfaces observed in very high-resolution images, with a kappa co-efficient of 0.81. (3) The narrow band feature differences (red-edge and near infrared narrow bands) in two-temporal Sentinel-2 images played a significant role in high-precision greenhouse mapping. The classification accuracy with narrow band features was much better than the maps produced without narrow band features. This scheme provided a method to digitize greenhouse precisely and publish its statistics for free, which enable advanced decision support for agriculture management.

AB Agricultural activities could represent an important sector for the economy of certain countries. In order to maintain control of this sector, it is necessary to schedule censuses on a regular basis, which represents an enormous cost. In recent years, different techniques have been proposed with the objective of reducing the cost and improving automation, these cover from Personal Digital Assistants usage to satellite image processing. In this paper, we described a methodology to perform a crop classification task over satellite images based on the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. Furthermore, we study how different color spaces could be applied to analyze satellite images. To test the accuracy of the proposal, we apply the methodology over a region and we present a comparison by evaluating the efficiency using three color spaces and different distance classifiers.

ID PLANT LITTER; REFLECTANCE
AB Management of plant litter or crop residues in agricultural fields is an important consideration for reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic C. Current methods of quantifying crop residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover within fields or across large regions. Our objectives were to evaluate several spectral indices for measuring crop residue cover using satellite multispectral and hyperspectral data and to categorize soil tillage intensity in agricultural fields. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data were acquired over agricultural fields in central Iowa in May and June 2004. Crop residue cover was measured in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max Merr.) fields using line-point transects. Spectral residue indices using Landsat TM bands were weakly related to crop residue cover. With the Hyperion data, crop residue cover was linearly related to the cellulose absorption index (CAI), which measures the relative intensity of cellulose and lignin absorption features near 2100 nm. Coefficients of determination (r(2)) for crop residue cover as a function of CAI were 0.85 for the May and 0.77 for the June Hyperion data. Three tillage intensity classes, corresponding to intensive (< 15% residue cover), reduced (15-30% cover) and conservation (> 30% cover) tillage, were correctly identified in 66-68% of fields. Classification accuracy increased to 80-82% for two classes, corresponding to conventional (intensive + reduced) and conservation tillage. By combining information on previous season's (2003) crop classification with crop residue cover after planting in 2004, an inventory of soil tillage intensity by previous crop type was generated for the whole Hyperion scene. Regional surveys of soil management practices that affect soil conservation and soil C dynamics are possible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and global positioning systems (GPS) may provide the technologies needed for farmers to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of precision farming. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) is able to minimize the impact of herbicide on environmental quality and arises the necessity of more precise approaches for weed patches determination. Ridolfia segetum is one of the most dominant, competitive and persistent weed in sunflower crops in southern Spain. In this paper, we used aerial imagery taken in mid-May, mid-June and mid-July according to different phenological stages of R. segetum and sunflower to evaluate the potential of evolutionary product-unit neural networks (EPUNNs), logistic regression (LR) and two different combinations of both (logistic regression using product units (LRPU) and logistic regression using initial covariates and product units (LRIPU)) for discriminating R. segetum patches and mapping R. segetum probabilities in sunflower crops on two naturally infested fields. After-wards, we compared the performance of these methods in every date to two recent classification models (support vector machines (SVM) and logistic model trees (LMT)). The results obtained present the models proposed as powerful tools for weed discrimination, the best performing model (LRIPU) obtaining generalization accuracies of 99.2% and 98.7% in mid-June. Our results suggest that a strategy to implement SSWM is feasible with minima omission and commission errors, and therefore, with a very low probability of not detecting R. segetum patches. The paper proposes the application of a new methodology that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously applied in RS, and which obtains better accuracy than more traditional RS classification techniques, such as vegetation indices or spectral angle mapper.

AB Because canola is a major oilseed crop, accurately determining its planting areas is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving UN 2030 sustainable development goals. However, when canola is extracted using remote-sensing data, winter wheat causes serious interference because it has a similar growth cycle and spectral reflectance characteristics. This interference seriously limits the classification accuracy of canola, especially in mixed planting areas. Here, a novel canola flower index (CFI) is proposed based on the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2 images to improve the accuracy of canola mapping, based on the finding that spectral reflectance of canola on the red and green bands is higher than that of winter wheat during the canola flowering period. To investigate the potential of the CFI for extracting canola, the IsoData, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classification methods were used to extract canola based on Sentinel-2 raw images and CFI images. The results show that the average overall accuracy and kappa coefficient based on CFI images were 94.77% and 0.89, respectively, which were 1.05% and 0.02, respectively, higher than those of the Sentinel-2 raw images. Then we found that a threshold of 0.14 on the CFI image could accurately distinguish canola from non-canola vegetation, which provides a solution for automatic mapping of canola. The overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of this threshold method were 96.02% and 0.92, which were very similar to those of the SVM and RF methods. Moreover, the advantage of the threshold classification method is that it reduces the dependence on training samples and has good robustness and high classification efficiency. Overall, this study shows that CFI and Sentinel-2 images provide a solution for automatic and accurate canola extraction.

AB The purpose of this study is to compare machine learning algorithm and deep learning algorithm in crop classification using multi-temporal remote sensing data. For this, impacts of machine learning and deep learning algorithms on (a) hyper-parameter and (2) training sample size were compared and analyzed for Haenam-gun, Korea and Illinois State, USA. In the comparison experiment, support vector machine (SVM) was applied as machine learning algorithm and convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied as deep learning algorithm. In particular, 2D-CNN considering 2-dimensional spatial information and 3D-CNN with extended time dimension from 2D-CNN were applied as CNN. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the hyper-parameter values of CNN, considering various hyper-parameter, defined in the two study areas were similar compared with SVM. Based on this result, although it takes much time to optimize the model in CNN, it is considered that it is possible to apply transfer learning that can extend optimized CNN model to other regions. Then, in the experiment results with various training sample size, the impact of that on CNN was larger than SVM. In particular, this impact was exaggerated in Illinois State with heterogeneous spatial patterns. In addition, the lowest classification performance of 3D-CNN was presented in Illinois State, which is considered to be due to over-fitting as complexity of the model. That is, the classification performance was relatively degraded due to heterogeneous patterns and noise effect of input data, although the training accuracy of 3D-CNN model was high. This results imply that a proper classification algorithms should be selected considering spatial characteristics of study areas. Also, a large amount of training samples is necessary to guarantee higher classification performance in CNN, particularly in 3D-CNN.

AB The capability of the ERS SAR to acquire images independently of cloud coverage or daylight conditions is of major significance in the context of agricultural applications, which are time critical. The accurate identification of rice crops using satellite radar has been shown to be dependent on the availability of images acquired during specific time windows through the growing season. For rice growing areas in the tropics, experience shows that high resolution optical satellite sensors cannot provide the desired information due to constraints related to cloud cover and revisit schedules.
   During 1997, ground data were collected on several ERS overpass dates in the Guangzhou Region of Guangdong Province where rice production is both irrigated plain and terraced. Parameters measured included rice crop growth and performance indicators. ERS-2 PRI images were calibrated, gee-coded and filtered, so allowing backscatter temporal signatures to be developed. Filtering and per pixel based classification performance have been investigated using supervised and neural network classifiers. Initial results have shown that it is possible to classify irrigated rice using images acquired on two dates and the difference image. However terrace rice has proved more difficult to classify due to interactions between the SAR beam and local topography. Standard beam mode Radarsat imagery has been acquired to investigate the effect of polarisation and incidence angle on rice classification performance.

AB Optical satellite sensors cannot see the earth's surface through clouds. Despite the periodic revisit cycle, image sequences acquired by earth observation satellites are, therefore, irregularly sampled in time. State-of-the-art methods for crop classification (and other time-series analysis tasks) rely on techniques that implicitly assume regular temporal spacing between observations, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We propose to use neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in combination with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model's hidden state, and a prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time such that one can integrate observations whenever they are available and extrapolate beyond the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN, indeed, improves classification accuracy over common baselines, such as LSTM, GRU, temporal convolutional network, and transformer. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where only few observations are available (i.e., frequent cloud cover). Moreover, we show that the ability to extrapolate translates to better classification performance early in the season, which is important for forecasting.

AB Accurately monitoring agriculture with satellite data is in constant demand. However, correctly relating the satellite data to ground data is not a trivial task. This study explores the possibility to use RGB digital images as ground truth in remote estimation of the flowering duration for the winter rapeseed crop (Brassica napus). I used a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone and camera. The flowering of the rapeseed crop is characterized by a very distinctive yellow color. The beginning and end of flowering is not an exact notion, but a user estimated one, based on the percentage of the flowering plants in the study area. Therefore, the aim is to pixel segment the acquired RGB digital images and identify the flowering pixels. The RGB color model is transformed into a Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color model that decouples the intensity information from the color information in the image. This transformation is used to improve the image classification in variable lighting conditions. Unsupervised image classification on the color transformed images gives satisfactory results in identifying the flowering pixels in the image in full and end flowering, if the images are taken under cloudless sky. The estimation of the results is done by visual user check. The experiment started after the beginning of flowering therefore this part will be performed and evaluated during the next flowering period.

AB In precision agriculture, detailed geoinformation on plant and soil properties plays an important role, e.g., in crop protection or the application of fertilizers. This paper presents a comparative classification analysis for post-harvest growth detection using geometric and radiometric point cloud features of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, considering the local neighborhood of each point. Radiometric correction of the TLS data was performed via an empirical range-correction function derived from a field experiment. Thereafter, the corrected amplitude and local elevation features were explored regarding their importance for classification. For the comparison, tree induction, Naive Bayes, and k-Means-derived classifiers were tested for different point densities to distinguish between ground and post-harvest growth. The classification performance was validated against highly detailed RGB reference images and the red edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI705), derived from a hyperspectral sensor. Using both geometric and radiometric features, we achieved a precision of 99% with the tree induction. Compared to the reference image classification, the calculated post-harvest growth coverage map reached an accuracy of 80%. RGB and LiDAR-derived coverage showed a polynomial correlation to NDVI705 of degree two with R-2 of 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. Larger post-harvest growth patches (>10 x 10 cm) could already be detected by a point density of 2 pts./0.01 m(2). The results indicate a high potential of radiometric and geometric LiDAR point cloud features for the identification of post-harvest growth using tree induction classification. The proposed technique can potentially be applied over larger areas using vehicle-mounted scanners. (c) 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

AB The dike-pond system (DPS) is the integration of a natural or man-made pond and crop cultivation on dikes, widely distributed in the Pearl River Delta and Jianghan plain in China. It plays a key role in preserving biodiversity, enhancing the nutrient cycle, and increasing crop production. However, DPS is rarely mapped at a large scale with satellite data, due to the limitations in the training dataset and traditional classification methods. This study improved the deep learning algorithm Cascade Region Convolutional Neural Network (Cascade R-CNN) algorithm to detect the DPS in Qianjiang City using high-resolution satellite data. In the proposed mCascade R-CNN, the regular convolution layer in the backbone was modified into the deformable convolutional layer, which was more suitable for learning the features of DPS with variable shapes and orientations. The mCascade R-CNN yielded the most accurate detection of DPS, with an average precision (AP) value that was 2.71% higher than Cascade R-CNN and 11.84% higher than You Look Only Once-v4 (YOLOv4). The area of oilseed rape growing on the dikes accounted for 3.42% of the total oilseed rape planting area. This study demonstrates the potential of the deep leaning methods combined with high-resolution satellite images in detecting integrated agriculture systems.

AB Sugarcane is a crop of great commercial and economic importance in over 130 countries, including Mexico. One of the main problems faced by sugarcane producers is how to improve the yield of the crop. In order to develop new techniques that can improve the yield of the sugarcane crop, it is key to be able to identify the critical stages of growth and to be able to make timely decisions. In this paper, a method is presented to identify the phenological stages of sugarcane crops using data from the MultiSpectral Instrument sensor onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite. For the development of the proposed method, classification some methods were evaluated. k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes. Also, time series of five vegetation indices were used as input data; the results were validated using the cross-validation technique with k = 10 iterations. The results show that the method Random Forest achieves an accuracy = 92.45%, which is the best suited to identify the growth stages of sugarcane crops.

TI Crop area estimation using high and medium resolution satellite imagery

SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES

DT Article
AB Reliable estimates of cropped area (CA) in developing countries with chronic food shortages are essential for emergency relief and the design of appropriate market-based food security programs. Satellite interpretation of CA is an effective alternative to extensive and costly field surveys, which fail to represent the spatial heterogeneity at the country-level. Bias-corrected, texture based classifications show little deviation from actual crop inventories, when estimates derived from aerial photographs or field measurements are used to remove systematic errors in medium resolution estimates. In this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid high-medium resolution technique for Central Ethiopia that combines spatially limited unbiased estimates from IKONOS images, with spatially extensive Landsat ETM+ interpretations, land-cover, and SRTM-based topography. Logistic regression is used to derive the probability of a location being crop. These individual points are then aggregated to produce regional estimates of CA. District-level analysis of Landsat based estimates showed CA totals which supported the estimates of the Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development. Continued work will evaluate the technique in other parts of Africa, while segmentation algorithms will be evaluated, in order to automate classification of medium resolution imagery for routine CA estimation in the future.

AB The use of vegetation indices is a fast and efficient method for vegetation monitoring by the use of remote sensing data. Throughout the years, a large number of multispectral vegetation indices have been formulated, each having variable degrees of efficiency in estimating one or more vegetation parameters such as, health status, nutrient or water deficiency, crop yield, vegetation cover fraction, leaf area index, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, net primary production and above-ground biomass. Additionally some of them also consider atmospheric effects and/or the soil background for an enhanced retrieval. With the production of biofuels appearing as a partial alleviation of global energy problem, accurate methods of estimating potential available biomass could prove invaluable for the energy budgeting at a national or international level. The paper is looking back in the past at the vegetation indices that have been used for the estimation of biomass, either directly though empirical relationships or through the estimation of other vegetation parameters such as the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR). This review was performed within the framework of the FP7 funded "Classification of European Biomass potential for Bioenergy using terrestrial and earth observations" (CEUBIOM) project.

TI Using long short-term memory recurrent neural network in land cover

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGE-ANALYSIS
AB Land cover maps are significant in assisting agricultural decision making. However, the existing workflow of producing land cover maps is very complicated and the result accuracy is ambiguous. This work builds a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) model to take advantage of the temporal pattern of crops across image time series to improve the accuracy and reduce the complexity. An end-to-end framework is proposed to train and test the model. Landsat scenes are used as Earth observations, and some field-measured data together with CDL (Cropland Data Layer) datasets are used as reference data. The network is thoroughly trained using state-of-the-art techniques of deep learning. Finally, we tested the network on multiple Landsat scenes to produce five-class and all-class land cover maps. The maps are visualized and compared with ground truth, CDL, and the results of SegNet CNN (convolutional neural network). The results show a satisfactory overall accuracy (> 97% for five-class and > 88% for all-class) and validate the feasibility of the proposed method. This study paves a promising way for using LSTM RNN in the classification of remote sensing image time series.

AB The objective of the study is to map and count the individual cabbages at the early growth stage in Sg. Palas, Cameron Highland grown under a mix cropping system and estimate its production. With ground verification, an IKONOS 4 in multispectral imagery acquired on 25 February 2001 was digitally processed at an orthorectified level. A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was developed and a scanned topographical map was overlaid with IKONOS data to precisely locate the attribute data and map the individual young growing cabbages. Using a supervised and unsupervised classification, less than and above 1.5 month-old cabbages were mapped and quantified. The algorithm and processing technique developed in this study can easily estimate a production of 25,000 cabbages/ha in Sg Palas area. Integrating the data with a Geographic Information System (GIs) may help Cameron Highland farmers to better market their cabbages in the future. The potential use of airborne hyperspectral imaging data such as UPM-APSB's AISA AeroMAP (TM) to map and predict the supply of cabbages should be the next step in precision farming revolution using remote sensing.

AB The MOMS-02 instrument is designed as a ''pushbroom'' scanning device for spectral data acquisition in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) range (Band 1: 449-511 nm, Band 2: 532-577 nm, Band 3: 645-677 nm, Band 4: 772-815 nm, IFOV:  13.5 m x 13.5 m), combined with along-track, simultaneously acquired forward, backward Bands 6/7: 524-763 nm (IFOV: 13.5 m x 13.5 m) and nadir Band 5: 512-765 nm (IFOV: 4.5 x 4.5 m) looking stereo capability. The location of the MS bands were done with respect to the suitibility of these spectral regions to analyze vegetation type and status. The calculations of the spectral significance for thematic data evaluation is based on spectroscopic field measurements of crops, balanced with an atmospheric transmission model (Lowtran 7), and the system parameters. The simulation results lead to the conclusion that the spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolution, combined with the on-track stereo capability of the MOMS-02 sensor, will result in substantial improvements in vegetation classification compared to concurrent remote sensing instruments like Landsat TM and Spot HRV.

AB Polarimetric radars sensors dealing with Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) techniques are of high usefulness for environmental ground truth measurement and validation and change monitoring of the terrestrial covers. PolSAR remote sensing techniques offer efficient and reliable means of collecting information required to extract biophysical and geophysical parameters about the earth's surface. They have found successful applications in crop monitoring, damage assessment, forestry, land use assessment, and also surveillance monitoring (oil spill detection, marine surveillance, etc.).
   It is clear that radar polarimetric techniques, with the use of a combination of more than one channel, help to detect target hidden in clutter, or to detect highly pure coherent radar target, as man-made objects like cars, tanks, ships. Moreover, the same type of clutter behaves in different ways with respect to the different polarimetric transmission schemes, making the process of clutter filtering more efficient and, enhancing the Signal-to-Noise ratio, improving target detection against various types of clutter.
   This paper is derived from a study to demonstrate the benefit of applying polarimetric technology in defence scenarios, with particular attention to target classification, target information extraction, and detection of man-made object in vegetated environment.

AB A procedure named CROPCLASS was developed to semi-automate census parcel crop assessment in any agricultural area using multitemporal remote images. For each area, CROPCLASS consists of a) a definition of census parcels through vector files in all of the images; b) the extraction of spectral bands (SB) and key vegetation index (VI) average values for each parcel and image; c) the conformation of a matrix data (MD) of the extracted information; d) the classification of MD decision trees (DT) and Structured Query Language (SQL) crop predictive model definition also based on preliminary land-use ground-truth work in a reduced number of parcels; and e) the implementation of predictive models to classify unidentified parcels land uses. The software named CROPCLASS-2.0 was developed to semi-automatically perform the described procedure in an economically feasible manner. The CROPCLASS methodology was validated using seven GeoEye-1 satellite images that were taken over the LaVentilla area (Southern Spain) from April to October 2010 at 3- to 4-week intervals. The studied region was visited every 3 weeks, identifying 12 crops and others land uses in 311 parcels. The DT training models for each cropping system were assessed at a 95% to 100% overall accuracy (OA) for each crop within its corresponding cropping systems. The DT training models that were used to directly identify the individual crops were assessed with 80.7% OA, with a user accuracy of approximately 80% or higher for most crops. Generally, the DT model accuracy was similar using the seven images that were taken at approximately one-month intervals or a set of three images that were taken during early spring, summer and autumn, or set of two images that were taken at about 2 to 3 months interval. The classification of the unidentified parcels for the individual crops was achieved with an OA of 79.5%.

AB [ 1] Climatological mean estimates of forest burning and crop waste burning based on broad assumptions of the amounts burned have so far been used for India in global inventories. Here we estimate open biomass burning representative of 1995 - 2000 from forests using burned area and biomass density specific for Indian ecosystems and crop waste burning as a balance between generation and known uses as fuel and fodder. High-resolution satellite data of active fires and land cover classification from MODIS, both on a scale of 1 km x 1 km, were used to capture the seasonal variability of forest and crop waste burning and in conjunction with field reporting. Correspondence in satellite-detected fire cycles with harvest season was used to identify types crop waste burned in different regions. The fire season in forest areas was from February to May, and that in croplands varied with geographical location, with peaks in April and October, corresponding to the two major harvest seasons. Spatial variability in amount of forest biomass burned differed from corresponding forest fire counts with biomass burned being largest in central India but fire frequency being highest in the east-northeast. Unutilized crop waste and MODIS cropland fires were predominant in the western Indo-Gangetic plain. However, the amounts of unutilized crop waste in the four regions were not strictly proportional to the fire counts. Fraction crop waste burned in fields ranged from 18 to 30% on an all-India basis and had a strong regional variation. Open burning contributes importantly ( about 25%) to black carbon, organic matter, and carbon monoxide emissions, a smaller amount ( 9 - 13%) to PM2.5 ( particulate mass in particles smaller than 2.5 micron diameter) and CO2 emissions, and negligibly to SO2 emissions (1%). However, it cannot explain a large "missing source'' of BC or CO from India.

AB Many African countries are facing increasing risks of food insecurity due to rising populations. Accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution of cropland is critical for the effective management of crop production and yield forecast. Most recent cropland products (2015 and 2016) derived from multi-source remote sensing data are available for public use. However, discrepancies exist among these cropland products, and the level of discrepancy is particularly high in several Africa regions. The overall goal of this study was to identify and assess the driving factors contributing to the spatial discrepancies among four cropland products derived from remotely sensed data. A novel approach was proposed to evaluate the spatial agreement of these cropland products and assess the impact of environmental factors such as elevation dispersion, field size, land-cover richness and frequency of cloud cover on these spatial differences. Results from this study show that the overall accuracies of the four cropland products are below 65%. In particular, large disagreements are seen on datasets covering Sahel zone and along the West African coasts. This study has identified land-cover richness as the driving factor with the largest contribution to the spatial disagreement among cropland products over Africa, followed by the high frequency of cloud cover, small and fragmented field size, and elevation complexity. To improve the accuracy of future cropland products for African regions, the data producers are encouraged to take a multi-classification approach and incorporate multi-sensors into their cropland mapping processes.

AB Most cropping systems around the world are organised around few dominant crops and a larger number of less frequent crops. While rare and infrequent crops occupy a small share of the cropped area, they produce ecological benefits on farmland, contribute to sustainability and help provide food and nutritional security. However, data about their location and extent derived from satellite imagery generally lack accuracy, largely owing to the class imbalance problem. Class imbalance occurs when only few instances of some classes are available for training classifiers, and leads to large error rates of the infrequent classes. In this study, we assessed the magnitude of the class imbalance problem in crop classification and evaluated balancing methods to combat it by creating synthetic minority observations or by removing majority observations. To that aim, we generated 18 unbalanced data sets from Sentinel-2 time series and crop type observations in Victoria, Australia. These data sets covered a wide range of complexity, number of classes, number of samples per class and spectral separability which enabled us to gather evidence about the benefits and drawbacks of balancing methods in various settings. Classification accuracy was assessed with two metrics: the Overall Accuracy (OA), which gives more weight to majority classes, and the G-Mean accuracy (GM), which is more sensitive to minority classes. Results showed that class imbalance explained near 40% of the accuracy variability. We found that balancing methods boosted GM by 0.01-0.54 but no single best solution emerged. The price for increasing the accuracy of minority classes was a drop in OA of a magnitude that was problem- and method-specific. We thus applied an algorithm selection method called the F-race to identify optimal balancing methods in a computationally economic fashion. Optimal balancing methods lead to maximum gain in GM and minimum loss in OA. We demonstrated that this approach either successfully identified optimal balancing methods or ones that were not significantly sub-optimal, while reducing the computational cost by up to 60%. It can readily be incorporated to operational crop classification systems with little disruption to the existing processing chains. This contribution paves the way for achieving a more comprehensive and detailed view of crop distribution and cropping sequences.

AB This chapter presents the soft margin regularized AdaBoost method for the classification of images acquired by satellite sensors. The regularized AdaBoost algorithm combines a number of RBF neural networks as base learners efficiently. The method is theoretically motivated by noting the need of regularization and soft margin in the standard AdaBoost method, particularly in the context of high-dimensional possibly noisy problems, such as those posed in the classification of hyperspectral images. Several experiments are conducted to assess method's behaviour in the classification of crop fields using satellite images of different dimensionality. A synthetic multispectral image and a real hyperspectral image acquired with the AVIRIS sensor are considered in our experiments. Performance is analyzed in terms of accuracy, robustness to different levels and nature of additive noise and ill-posing situations. In all cases, the method is compared to state-of-the-art support vector machines (SVM) and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline method. Experimental results suggest that this method can be more useful than SVMs or LDA in low signal-to-noise ratio environments and when input dimension is relatively high.

AB Detection of growth areas of hazardous invasive plants, such as Heracleum Sosnowskyi (HS), in satellite images, is an important application of machine learning and computer vision methods. There exists extensive literature on the problem of crop classification in images. However, sometimes, the hardest part is to gather qualitative labels and gather enough data to train models. Notably, this difficulty arises in the analysis of satellite images, where labeling the data is hard to perform manually. In this work, we've faced the same problem (lack of data) when trying to build a classification model for HS detection in images. The issue of lack of data can be solved by generating synthetic data using simple methods like oversampling (OS) to more complex techniques like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no work that has compared the performance of using OS versus VAE to generate synthetic pixels to overcome the problem of data deficiency for the task of HS classification in images. Accordingly, in this work, we perform this comparison and present the evaluation results on our dataset.

AB When estimating fossil fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO2) emissions from observed CO2 concentrations, the accuracy can be hampered by biogenic carbon exchanges during the growing season, even for urban areas where strong fossil fuel emissions are found. While biogenic carbon fluxes have been studied extensively across natural vegetation types, biogenic carbon fluxes within an urban area have been challenging to quantify due to limited observations and differences between urban and rural regions. Here we developed a simple model representation, i.e., SolarInduced Fluorescence (SIF) for Modeling Urban biogenic Fluxes ("SMUrF"), that estimates the gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) over cities around the globe. Specifically, we leveraged space-based SIF, machine learning, eddy-covariance (EC) flux data, and ancillary remote-sensing-based products, and we developed algorithms to gap-fill fluxes for urban areas. Grid-level hourly mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes are extracted from SMUrF and evaluated against (1) non-gap-filled measurements at 67 EC sites from FLUXNET during 2010-2014 (r > 0.7 for most data-rich biomes), (2) independent observations at two urban vegetation and two crop EC sites over Indianapolis from August 2017 to December 2018 (r = 0.75), and (3) an urban biospheric model based on fine- grained land cover classification in Los Angeles (r = 0.83). Moreover, we compared SMUrF-based NEE with inventory-based FFCO2 emissions over 40 cities and addressed the urban-rural contrast in both the magnitude and timing of CO2 fluxes. To illustrate the application of SMUrF, we used it to interpret a few summertime satellite tracks over four cities and compared the urban-rural gradient in column CO2 (XCO2) anomalies due to NEE against XCO2 enhancements due to FFCO2 emissions. With rapid advances in space-based measurements and increased sampling of SIF and CO2 measurements over urban areas, SMUrF can be useful to inform the biogenic CO2 fluxes over highly vegetated regions during the growing season.

AB A pixel-based cropland classification study based on the fusion of data from satellite images with different resolutions is presented. It is based on a time series of multispectral images acquired at different resolutions by different imaging instruments, Landsat-8 and RapidEye. The proposed data fusion method capabilities are explored with the aim of overcoming the shortcomings of different instruments in the particular cropland classification scenario characterized by the very small size of crop fields over the chosen agricultural region situated in the plains of Vojvodina in northern Serbia. This paper proposes a data fusion method that is successfully utilized in combination with arobust random forest classifier in improving the overall classification performance, as well as in enabling application of satellite imagery with a coarser spatial resolution in the given specific cropland classification task. The developed method effectively exploits available data and provides an improvement over the existing pixel-based classification approaches through the combination of different data sources. Another contribution of this paper is the employment of crowdsourcing in the process of reference data collection via dedicated smartphone application. (C) The Authors.

AB The Earth is in an era, when the natural balance has been deteriorated by the human and the adverse effects have been increased by these deteriorations. The adverse effects of global climate change have no limitations, and if these effects are overlooked by the human, they shall spread to all areas rapidly. The plants, which are so important for all living creatures, shall be faced with deaths, migrations or adaptation challenges in the future because of the climate change-originated geographical alteration on the variables such as air temperature and precipitation. These reasons make essential the estimations of geographical distribution of plants in the future. In the study, the geographic-climatic suitability of maize, safflower, canola (rape), cotton, wheat and switchgrass was projected for 2070, and the current and future conditions were compared. The applied steps in the study are; (1) the climatic data-obtained from Worldclim as current and 2070-projected data, (2) the identification of essential temperature and precipitation intervals for crops' growth from EcoCrop, (3) application of the Climate Change Adaptation Modeler (CCAM)'s sub-model "Crop Climatic Suitability Modeling (CCSM)" in TerrSet, a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing software by Clark Labs, and finally (4) generation of the climatic suitability maps for each crop for current and future. With this study, the climate-based geographic suitability of plants was evaluated for Turkey where is dominated by Mediterranean climate pattern as 41.1% in Koppen Climate Classification. In the study, the projected areal suitability of maize, switchgrass and cotton shall not change significantly according to current conditions. Safflower's and canola's areal suitability shall expand and displace, respectively. Here, the major loser in areal suitability shall be wheat in Turkey. The methodology may aid for planners and land managers to understand changes in climatic suitability of plants from present to future.

AB Summer frosts occur frequently on the Bolivian Altiplano (4000 m) and cause severe damage to potato and quinua crops. A regional statistical study of frost risks must combine meteorological data with satellite data. In this work, a new method is developed to use NOAA satellite temperatures together with local minimum air temperature data. This method enables point meteorological data (with important historical records) to be combined with satellite data (spatially extended but with poor temporal coverage). The method involves several stages including a classification of the Altiplano based on the meteorological stations, a calculation of minimum temperatures over the whole Altiplano for several years of data, and finally the computation of minimum temperatures and frost risk percentage maps. The precision obtained in the resulting synthesis images is 0.8 degrees C for the average minimum temperatures and 9% for frost risk maps. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land use land cover (LULC) changes are inherently spatial and dynamic with high spatiotemporal variability resulted from complex human-environmental interactions. Current extents, rates and intensities of LULC changes are driving unprecedented changes in ecosystems functions and environmental processes at local, regional and global scales. The study was conducted to assess LULC changes and its drivers using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) in Gojeb River Catchment, Ethiopia. The satellite images at different reference years (1978, 1987, 2001 and 2015) were obtained from Landsat images. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was applied for image processing and change analysis. The LULC classes identified were cropland, forestland, shrubland, swamp, and woodland. The study found that the catchment has undergone significant LULC changes. The major changes were expansion of cropland at the expense of other LULC classes at the rate of 29.56% in 1978, 38.91% in 1987, 46.62% in 2001 and 52.74% in 2015. It has gained about 160,736.08 ha with an annual average increment of 4,344.22 ha. Conversely, forestland has undergone reductions at an annual rate of 9,030.0 ha between 1978 and 1987. The conversions of other classes to cropland are mainly associated with more demand for crop production. On the other hand, the conversion of relevant part of forest land to other classes could be due to vegetation degradation. Hence, the conversion of forestland to other land use classes could be attributed to the highly demand of agricultural land, firewood, charcoal, timbers and housing materials. The major driving forces which should be considered in sustainable watershed management were population growth and government induced settlements. Provision of modern alternative sources of energy, agricultural inputs and promoting non-agricultural sectors are also other considerations for the community sustainable livelihood. It is critical to follow holistic view and management of the catchment for successful integrated watershed management endeavours.

AB Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data present an opportunity for acquiring crop information without restrictions caused by weather and illumination conditions, at a spatial resolution appropriate for individual rice fields and a temporal resolution sufficient to capture the growth profiles of different crop species. This study investigated the use of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data and Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to map the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields across parts of the Sanjiang plain, in northeast China. The satellite sensor data were acquired throughout the rice crop-growing season (May-October). A co-registered set of 10 dual polarization (VH/VV) SAR and NDVI images depicting crop phenological development were used as inputs to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithms in order to map paddy rice fields. The results showed a significant increase in overall classification when the NDVI time-series data were integrated with the various combinations of multi-temporal polarization channels (i.e. VH, VV, and VH/VV). The highest classification accuracies overall (95.2%) and for paddy rice (96.7%) were generated using the RF algorithm applied to combined multi-temporal VH polarization and NDVI data. The SVM classifier was most effective when applied to the dual polarization (i.e. VH and VV) SAR data alone and this generated overall and paddy rice classification accuracies of 91.6% and 82.5%, respectively. The results demonstrate the practicality of implementing RF or SVM machine learning algorithms to produce 10 m spatial resolution maps of paddy rice fields with limited ground data using a combination of multi-temporal SAR and NDVI data, where available, or SAR data alone. The methodological framework developed in this study is apposite for large-scale implementation across China and other major rice-growing regions of the world.

AB In Africa, food security early warning systems use satellite-derived data concerning crop conditions and agricultural production. Such systems can be improved if they are provided with a more reliable estimation of the cultivated area at national scale. This paper evaluates the potential of using time series from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MOD13Q1 (16-day composite of normalized difference vegetation index at 250 m resolution) to extract cultivated areas in the fragmented rural landscapes of Mali. To this end, we first stratified Southern Mali into 13 rural landscapes based on the spatio-temporal variability of NDVI and textural indices, using an object-oriented classification scheme.
   The accuracy of the resulting map (MODIScrop) and how it compares with existing coarse-resolution global land products (GLC2000 Africa, GLOBCOVER, MODIS V05 and ECOCLIMAP-II), was then assessed against six crop/non-crop maps derived from SPOT 2.5 m resolution images used as references. For crop areal coverage, the MODIScrop cultivated map was successful in assessing the overall cultivated area at five out of the six validation sites (less than 6% of the absolute difference), while in terms of crop spatial distribution, the producer accuracy was between 33.1% and 80.8%. This accuracy was linearly correlated with the mean patch size index calculated on the SPOT crop maps (r(2) = 0.8). Using the Pareto boundary as an accuracy assessment method at the study sites, we showed that (i) 20-40% of the classification crop error was due to the spatial resolution of the MODIS sensor (250 m), and that (ii) compared to MODIS V05, which otherwise performed better than the other existing products. MODIScrop generally minimized omission-commission errors. A spatial validation of the different products was carried out using SPOT image classifications as reference. In the corresponding error matrices, the fraction of correctly classified pixels for our product was 70%, compared to 58% for MODIS V05, while it ranged between 40% and 51% for the GLC2000, the ECOCLIMAP-II and the GLOBCOVER.

AB A field study has been carried out in Pantnagar; district U. S. Nagar of Uttarakhand State for wheat acreage estimation, during Rabi season of the year 2010-2011. Two types of data viz. satellite data of Haldwani region dated 22nd March 2010 and ground truth data have been used for the study. EN-VI-4.8 (Environment for Visualizing Images-4.8) software was used for image pre processing and analysis of the data. Wheat crop at the maximum vegetative stage was used to capture the crop spectral characteristics. Supervised classification was used to identify the wheat crop in Pantnagar. Ground truth data combined with visual interpretation obtained from LANDSAT image dated 22nd March 2010 were used as training sets for supervised classification. The training pixels were selected from different fields. The total numbers of five classes were identified for which separate ROIs (Region of Interest) were generated in order to train the image processing software. The accuracy of the classification was determined by comparing the test set with the classification results to generate producers, user's and the overall accuracies. The overall accuracy obtained was 100%. Post classification statistics was generated to find out pixels belonging to different categories. The acreage of all the classes was computed by multiplying the total number of pixels in a category with the area of single pixel. The size of each pixel in LANDSAT image is 30m and hence the area covered by each pixel is 30mx30m (900m(2)). The total number of pixels obtained was 16,495. Therefore, total area under study was found to be 1484.55 ha.

AB Multivariate satellite-image time-series (MSITS) are a valuable source of information for a wide range of agricultural applications. Image classification, one of the main applications of this type of data, is a challenging task. It is mainly because MSITS are generated by a complex interaction among several sources of information, which are known as the factors of variation. These factors contain different information with different levels of relevance to a classification task. Thus, a proper representation of MSITS data is required in order to extract and model the most useful information from these factors for classification purpose. To this end, this article proposes three multiple kernel representations of MSITS data. These representations extract the most classification-related information from these data through combining the basis kernels constructed from different factors of variation of the MSITS data. In the proposed representations, the combination of the basis kernels was achieved by using the multiple kernel learning algorithms. The efficiency of the proposed multiple kernel representations was evaluated based both on analysing the relevance of their kernels to the classification task and their classification performances. Two different MSITS data sets composed of 10 RapidEye imageries of an agricultural area were used to evaluate the performances of the proposed methods. In addition, the classification results of both MSITS using a single kernel were considered as the baseline for comparison. The results showed an increase of up to 14% in overall accuracy of the classification maps by using the multiple kernel representations. Moreover, these particular representations for classification of time-series observations were able to handle the undesirable effects in image data such as the presence of clouds and their shadows.

AB Theoretically, the appearance of shadows in aerial imagery is not desirable for researchers because it leads to errors in object classification and bias in the calculation of indices. In contrast, shadows contain useful geometrical information about the objects blocking the light. Several studies have focused on estimation of building heights in urban areas using the length of shadows. This type of information can be used to predict the population of a region, water demand, etc., in urban areas. With the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the availability of high- to super-high-resolution imagery, the important questions relating to shadows have received more attention. Three-dimensional imagery generated using UAV-based photogrammetric techniques can be very useful, particularly in agricultural applications such as in the development of an empirical equation between biomass or yield and the geometrical information of canopies or crops. However, evaluating the accuracy of the canopy or crop height requires labor-intensive efforts. In contrast, the geometrical relationship between the length of the shadows and the crop or canopy height can be inversely solved using the shadow length measured. In this study, object heights retrieved from UAV point clouds are validated using the geometrical shadow information retrieved from three sets of high-resolution imagery captured by Utah State University's AggieAir UAV system. These flights were conducted in 2014 and 2015 over a commercial vineyard located in California for the USDA Agricultural Research Service Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration Experiment (GRAPEX) Program. The results showed that, although this approach could be computationally expensive, it is faster than fieldwork and does not require an expensive and accurate instrument such as a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS.

AB South Korea has experienced severe droughts and water scarcity problems that have influenced agriculture, food prices, and crop production in recent years. Traditionally, climate-based drought indices using point-based meteorological observations have been used to help quantify drought impacts on the vegetation in South Korea. However, these approaches have a limited spatial precision when mapping detailed vegetation stress caused by drought. For these reasons, the development of a drought index that provides detailed spatial-resolution information on drought-affected vegetation conditions is essential to improve the country's drought monitoring capabilities, which are needed to help develop more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. The objective of this study was to develop a satellite-based hybrid drought index called the vegetation drought response index for South Korea (VegDRI-SKorea) that could improve the spatial resolution of agricultural drought monitoring on a national scale. The VegDRI-SKorea was developed for South Korea, modifying the original VegDRI methodology (developed for the USA) by tailoring it to the available local data resources. The VegDRI-SKorea utilizes a classification and regression tree (CART) modelling approach that collectively analyses remote-sensing data (e.g. normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), climate-based drought indices (e.g. self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI)), and biophysical variables (e.g. elevation and land cover) that influence the drought-related vegetation stress. This study evaluates the performance of the recently developed VegDRI-SKorea for severe and extreme drought events that occurred in South Korea in 2001, 2008, and 2012. The results demonstrated that the hybrid drought index improved the more spatially detailed drought patterns compared to the station-based drought indices and resulted in a better understanding of drought impacts on the vegetation conditions. The VegDRI-SKorea model is expected to contribute to the monitoring of drought conditions nationally. In addition, it will provide the necessary information on the spatial variations of those conditions to evaluate local and regional drought risk assessment across South Korea and assist local decision-makers in drought risk management.

AB Drought disaster risk occurrence frequency is one of most high, and its affection is most severe in the worldwide, which is more serious in China and had threatened our food security. With the climate change, drought disaster had serious impacts on agricultural production and increasing risks of agricultural disasters. Therefore, the agricultural drought risk characteristics and management problem are particularly important under climate warming conditions. Drought disaster risk was effected by the spatial and temporal pattern of drought risk hazard factors such as the frequency and intensity of precipitation, environmental vulnerability, sensitivity and exposure. These three factors are both independent and connected each other. In view of this, based on the crops drought threshold and the risk mechanism, firstly, we analyzed the drought disaster risk research progress domestic and overseas in recent, which can provide information to the future studies. Secondly, the agriculture drought risk assessment must be established based on detailed agricultural drought dynamic monitoring and assessment methods, and the main technological process included building the assessed database using the meteorological observation data, drought disaster data, integration of data and remote sensing, a long sequence of yield and climate and drought disaster loss data (including agricultural drought of drought induced areas, drought -occurred areas and no harvest areas), based on remote sensing inversion, field investigation, mathematical statistics and so on, comparing the adaptability of the drought monitoring index, identifying the drought disaster hazard index. Thirdly, based on the long term drought disaster and production data, selecting the occurring drought samples in the crop growth period and calculating reduction rate, building the relationship between production and drought disaster index, based on the reduction rate to quantify the hazard index critical value and grading, quantify the contribution degree of the drought in different growth period to production, confirming the different agriculture drought intensity threshold values and its classifications. And then, based on the theory of coupled risk simulation, combined the drought disaster hazard factor, environmental vulnerability, sensitivity and exposure theory to build the agriculture key growth period disaster risk assessment models. Based on the built models, the different grades drought threshold values, the drought risk development characteristics and drought regional difference can be identified. Lastly, revealed the contribution of key physical factor to risk and it physical mechanism to happen. These can provide some information on the agriculture key growth period drought risk physical mechanism and improving risk management levels.

AB Currently, high-temperature risk assessments of crops at the regional scale are usually conducted by comparing the observed air temperature at ground stations or via the remote sensing inversion of canopy temperature (such as MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) land surface temperature (LST)) with the threshold temperature of the crop. Since this threshold is based on the absolute temperature value, it is difficult to account for changes in environmental conditions and crop canopy information between different regions and different years in the evaluation model. In this study, MODIS LST products were used to establish an evaluation model (spatiotemporal deviation mean (STDM)) and a classification method to determine maize-growing areas at risk of high temperatures at the regional scale. The study area was the Huang-Huai-Hai River plain of China where maize is grown and high temperatures occur frequently. The spatiotemporal distribution of the high-temperature risk of summer maize was determined in the study area from 2003 to 2018. The results demonstrate the applicability of the model at the regional scale. The distribution of high-temperature risk in the Huang-Huai-Hai region was consistent with the actual temperature measurements. The temperatures in the northwestern, southwestern, and southern parts were relatively high and the area was classified as a stable zone. Shijiazhuang, Jiaozuo, Weinan, Xi'an, and Xianyang city were located in a zone of increasing high temperatures. The regions with a stable high-temperature risk were Xiangfan, Yuncheng, and Luoyang city. Areas of decreasing high temperatures were Handan, Xingtai, Bozhou, Fuyang, Nanyang, Linfen, and Pingdingshan city. Areas that need to focus on preventing high-temperature risks include Luoyang, Yuncheng, Xianyang, Weinan, and Xi'an city. This study provides a new method for the detailed evaluation of regional high-temperature risk and data support.

AB Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crop morphological and physiological status and supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties' mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.

AB In many applications of the remote sensing, an user is often interested in identifying specific land cover only while other classes may be of no interest. In the present study, high resolution WorldView-2 image having spatial resolution of 1.84 meter has been used for identifying wheat crop for a test site located in Roorkee, India. WorldView-2 data consists of a total of eight spectral bands out of which last four spectral bands i.e. Red (630-690 nm), Red edge (705-745 nm), NIR 1 (770-895 nm) and NIR 2 (860-1040 nm) are useful for the vegetation related studies. Since Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is formulated by the Red and NIR band, is well known for vegetation related studies. Therefore, in the present research the above four bands has been used to generate all the four possible combinations of NDVI viz. Red - NIR1, Red edge - NIR 1, Red - NIR 2 and Red edge - NIR 2. Further to study the temporal behaviour of crops, two date WorldView-2 data was taken to make the temporal NDVI. These temporal NDVI were then classified using fuzzy based Possibilistic c-Means (PCM) soft classification. The weighting exponent (or fuzzifier) m was optimized to get the best PCM soft classification output. Wheat crop is represented as the fraction image output of the PCM soft classification corresponding to each temporal NDVI. To check the accuracy of these fraction images, the entropy method was used. The entropy values were calculated for a total of 150 known pixels in each output. It is found that the outputs corresponding to low entropy values have sufficiently high membership values for wheat class, hence these outputs are more accurate. Further, it is observed that the average entropy values found for the temporal NDVI corresponding to the Red -NIR 1, Red edge - NIR 1, Red -NIR 2 and Red edge -NIR 2 are 0.065, 0.089, 0.075 and 0.055 respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that temporal NDVI generated by using a combination of Red edge and NIR-2 bands yields higher accuracies in comparison to other. It was also observed from the study that the optimized values of weighting exponent m is varies for different spectral indices.

AB The monitoring of different crops (cultivated plots) and types of surface (bare soils, etc.) is a crucial economic and environmental issue for the management of resources and human activity. In this context, the objective of this study is to evaluate the contribution of multispectral satellite imagery (optical and radar) to land use and land cover classification.
   Object-oriented supervised classifications, based on a Random Forest algorithm, and majority zoning post-processing are used. This study emerges from the experiment on multi-sensor crop monitoring (MCM'10, Baup et al., 2012) conducted in 2010 on a mixed farming area in the southwest of France, near Toulouse. This experiment enabled the regular and quasi-synchronous collection of multi-sensor satellite data and in situ observations, which are used in this study. 211 plots with contrasting characteristics (different slopes, soil types, aspects, farming practices, shapes and surface areas) were monitored to represent the variability of the study area. They can be grouped into four classes of land cover: 39 grassland areas, 100 plots of wheat, 13 plots of barley, 20 plots of rapeseed, and 2 classes of bare soil: 23 plots of small roughness and 16 plots of medium roughness. Satellite radar images in the X-, C- and L-bands (HH polarization) were acquired between 14 and 18 April 2010. Optical images delivered by Formosat-2 and corresponding field data were acquired on 14 April 2010.
   The results show that combining images acquired in the L-band (Alos) and the optical range (Formosat-2) improves the classification performance (overall accuracy = 0.85, kappa = 0.81) compared to the use of radar or optical data alone. The results obtained for the various types of land cover show performance levels and confusions related to the phenological stage of the species studied, with the geometry of the cover, the roughness states of the surfaces, etc. Performance is also related to the wavelength and penetration depth of the signal providing the images. Thus, the results show that the quality of the classification often increases with increasing wavelength of the images used.

AB Two independent estimates of poplar plantations surfaces were carried out on a study area located in Konya-Eregli, south-west Anatolia: a ground based inventory on a stratified sample and a supervised classification of Landsat TM satellite data. The ground based inventory was based on the area frame sampling methodology developed by the European Union for crop area estimate. The supervised classification was performed using a multitemporal set of two Landsat TM sub-scenes, spring and late summer 1996. Differential Global Positioning Systems were used in the field to collect training areas. The NDVI of both images and the ratio between them were used as input data in a Maximum Likelihood Classification. Results from the two estimates were analysed and compared: classification results;are not significantly different from field data; the difference between the two estimates is much less than the standard error of the field estimate.

AB Accurate and timely information about crop acreage estimation is important for agricultural management. In Turkey, wheat production is very important, and it is widely planted in Anatolia and in Southeastern Turkey. In this study, four different classification types were evaluated for wheat determination. As a study area, the region of Islahiye and Nurdagi counties of Gaziantep, Turkey was chosen. As satellite data, a Landsat 8 OLI image acquired on April 10, 2017 was used. The ground-truth points that were collected in surveying, and additionally field information taken from farmer registration system provided by local administrations were used as references. The application was done by classification of the satellite image using four different methods (Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Condition-Based and Nearest Neighbor). After the results were obtained, the wheat classes obtained were transformed to vector format to overlay on the satellite image for visual analysis. The area of wheat class obtained from each method was presented and compared. The results were also evaluated by comparing with the data taken from Turkish Statistical Institute. All of the methods provided results close to the Turkish Statistical Institute records. Even the results were not significantly different from each other, wheat area determined using Support Vector Machine classification was better than others. The accuracy assessments were performed by calculating the total accuracy and KAPPA/KIA coefficient. The accuracy assessment analysis showed that the three supervised methods were better than the unsupervised one. As a future study, evaluation of these four classification methods using a multi-temporal dataset is planned.

AB Land use and land cover change due to human activities in a time sequence. Detection of such changes may help decision makers and planners to understand the factors in land use and land cover changes in order to take effective and useful measures. Remote sensing and GIS techniques may be used as efficient tools to detect and assess land use changes.
   In recent years, a considerable land use changes have occurred in the greater Zanjan area. In order to understand the type and rate of changes in this area, Landsat TM images captured in 1984 and 2009 have been selected for comparison.
   First, geometric correction and contrast stretch are applied. In order to detect and evaluate land use changes, image differencing, principal component analyses and Fuzzy ARTMAP classification method are applied. Finally, the results of land cover classification for three different times are compared to reveal land use changes. Then, combined Cellular Automata with Markov Chain analysis is employed to forecast of human impacts on land use change until 2020 in Zanjan area
   The results of the present study disclose that about 36 percents of the total area changed their land use, e.g., changing agricultural land, orchard and bare land to settlements, construction of industrial areas and highways. The crop pattern also changes, such as orchard land to agricultural land and vice versa. The mentioned changes have occurred within last 25 years in Zanjan city and its surrounding area.

AB Compact polarimetry (CP) offers a tradeoff with fully polarimetric modes in terms of swath width, power budget, and polarimetric information content. In this letter, a classification comparison is made among real CP, simulated CP (SCP), and quad polarimetric (QP) data acquired from the L-band SAR system on board the ALOS-2 satellite. The Wishart supervised classification scheme is used to compare data modes over two regions of a mixed test site in India. The quantitative classification assessment indicates that the QP data have higher classification accuracy than any other polarimetric combinations for both regions. The comparative classification accuracy of real versus SCP data is different for the two regions. The overall accuracy of the real CP data is slightly higher similar to 1% than SCP for region 1, which is dominated by urban and rice classes, whereas it is lower by similar to 9% for the agricultural crop dominated region 2.

ID CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; ACCURACY
AB Crop mapping through classification of Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) data can provide precious information for several agricultural applications, such as crop monitoring, yield forecasting, and crop inventory. However, several issues affect the classification performance of SITS data. As one of the most challenging problems, constituent images of time-series provide different levels of information about crops. These differences are the result of dynamic spectral responses of crops and also the variable atmospheric and sensor conditions. The second issue is the unavailability of adequate high-quality samples for training the classifier. In this study, we proposed a novel computationally efficient Multi-Domain Active Learning (MDAL) method which takes advantage of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and Active Learning (AL) algorithms to address these two issues. The proposed method uses MKL algorithms to address the issues associated with different information level of the data, which generally cannot be modelled using the well-known classification algorithms. AL algorithms were also used for semi-automatic selection of training samples. However, most of the MKL algorithms are very computationally demanding. Consequently, using them in the MDAL method can dramatically increase the computational costs. Thus, in this paper, we presented the similarity-based MKL algorithms. Thanks to their low computational complexities, these algorithms are the most suitable MKL algorithms that can be used in the MDAL method. We evaluated the proposed method using two multispectral SITS datasets, acquired by RapidEye and SPOT sensors. The obtained results of the MDAL method for these datasets respectively showed 8.2% and 5.87% increase in the overall accuracy of classification as compared to the accuracy of the standard AL algorithm. The results also showed that in the case of adopting the SimpleMKL algorithm (a common MKL algorithm in the literature) the computational time of the MDAL method is 577 and 474 seconds for RapidEye and SPOT datasets, respectively. However, in the case of adopting the similarity-based MKL algorithms, these computational times respectively decreases to 4 and 2 seconds.

AB Remote sensing approaches are of increasing importance for agricultural applications, particularly for the support of selective agricultural measures that increase the productivity of crop stands. In contrast to multi-spectral image data, hyperspectral data has been shown to be highly suitable for the detection of crop growth anomalies, since they allow a detailed examination of stress-dependent changes in certain spectral ranges. However, the entire spectrum covered by hyperspectral data is probably not needed for discrimination between healthy and stressed plants. To define an optimal sensor-based system or a data product designed for crop stress detection, it is necessary to know which spectral wavelengths are significantly affected by stress factors and which spectral resolution is needed. In this study, a single airborne hyperspectral HyMap dataset was analyzed for its potential to detect plant stress symptoms in wheat stands induced by a pathogen infection. The Bhattacharyya distance (BD) with a forward feature search strategy was used to select relevant bands for the differentiation between healthy and fungal infected stands. Two classification algorithms, i.e. spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector machines (SVM) were used to classify the data covering an experimental field. Thus, the original dataset as well as datasets reduced to several band combinations as selected by the feature selection approach were classified. To analyze the influence of the spectral resolution on the detection accuracy, the original dataset was additionally stepwise spectrally resampled and a feature selection was carried out on each step. It is demonstrated that just a few phenomenon-specific spectral features are sufficient to detect wheat stands infected with powdery mildew. With original spectral resolution of HyMap, the highest classification accuracy could be obtained by using only 13 spectral bands with a Kappa coefficient of 0.59 in comparison to Kappa 0.57 using all spectral bands of the HyMap sensor. The results demonstrate that even a few hyperspectral bands as well as bands with lower spectral resolution still allow an adequate detection of fungal infections in wheat. By focusing on a few relevant bands, the detection accuracy could be enhanced and thus more reliable information could be extracted which may be helpful in agricultural practice.

SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE EROSION; REMOTE SENSING
AB In order to regionalize an erosion model based on a soil loss equation, the type of agricultural landuse and the percentage of ground cover play a major role. A supervised classification of multidate SPOT imagery has been used for mapping the crops, and vegetation indices have been derived from spectral data of each crop class in order to evaluate the soil coverage associated with these classes, in a hilly environment of the Quebec Appalachians in Canada.
   The relation between ground coverage and vegetation indices for each crop has been obtained by photographic and radiometric measurements on the ground at ten days interval throughout the growing season. Similarity between ground and satellite observations is reasonably good. Results of the field campaign show that, generally, vegetation indices overestimate the ground coverage at the beginning of the growing season and underestimate it at the end, with the appearance of senescence. These data will be integrated into a GIS for spatial mapping and modelling of erosion.

AB Bangladesh has a large and growing population that will demand more food and place greater pressure on resources. Dry season irrigated Boro rice production is important for national food security. Dry season irrigation mainly uses groundwater, but the extent of its use is not well known. We assessed groundwater use and water productivity of Boro in the northwest region of Bangladesh using remote sensing based energy balance modelling, crop classification and secondary statistics. The energy balance modelling shows a large spatial variation in the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from about 325 to 470 mm, with an overall spatial average of 365 mm during dry season. The estimated values of ETa correspond well with independent values from field and regional scale soil and water balance modelling results. From spatial estimates of ETa and effective rainfall, we computed regional net groundwater use for Boro production in 2009 as 2.4 km(3). Groundwater is being used unsustainably in some areas, and a spatial time series (1990 to 2010) of pre- and post-monsoon groundwater depth changes in the northwest region of Bangladesh suggests that, with the current level of groundwater use, falling groundwater levels may pose a long term threat to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in much of the region. Boro water productivity varies from 0.95 to 1.35 kg/m(3), allowing the identification of high performing "bright" and low performing "hot" spots and the development of strategies to reduce crop yield/productivity gaps and ensure future food security.

AB The objective of this work was to determine if spectral images form the QuickBird satellite can differentiate avocado (Persea americana Mill.) trees infected with Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) from healthy or asymptomatic trees, and also from other tree species. Differentiation between healthy and ASBVd symptomatic trees was approached with the classification of maximum likelihood. Nine symptomatic avocado trees, verified by RT-PCR 20 d before the satellite image capture, were positively detected by the image. Detection precision lowered to 70.4 % when the study was made 14 and 24 months after the image capture of 112 symptomatic and asymptomatic avocado trees. The satellite technique would be more efficient if the tree sampling, RT-PCR analysis and image capture, are simultaneously made. This is the first report for the detection of ASBVd symptomatic avocado trees with high spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Digital analysis of remotely sensed imagery allowed differentiation of avocado from oak trees, and from plant free soil, and could be used to estimate the avocado cropped area in a region.

AB In this article we investigate if qualitative soil fertility datasets derived during participatory processes can be combined with a corresponding land use change model (i) to improve the understanding of the social-ecological complexity of land use change and (ii) to allow testing of alternative scenarios even in data-poor environments. To test this hypothesis, a participatory assessment approach was combined with the spatially explicit, soil fertility driven FALLOW (Forest, Agroforest, Low-value Landscape Or Wasteland?) model. For a case study village in Northwest Vietnam, participatory evaluations with two age groups of farmers were employed in an iterative way to derive qualitative and quantitative model input data to test scenarios of current and improved management on upland soil fertility evolution with FALLOW. The indigenous colour-based soil quality classification was successfully integrated into the Trenbath FALLOW soil module. The model baseline scenario was validated by calculating the goodness-of-fit of model outputs with land cover maps (F-t 0.78) from remote sensing. Model scenario analysis suggested a masking effect of ongoing soil fertility decline by use of fertilizers and hybrid crop varieties, indicating a resource overuse that becomes increasingly irreversible without external interventions. Simulations further suggest that success of introduction of improved cropping management methods becomes less effective with increasing soil degradation and cannot fully restore initial soil fertility. We conclude that the coupled semi-quantitative approach is useful at the village level as it generated meaningful insights into local land use change dynamics without the need for long-term and data-intensive studies.

AB This applied research was conducted by employing both quantitative and qualitative innovative research methods. This research investigates the satellite data of four spectral bands sent from the Small Multi-Mission Satellite (SMMS). Each band was analyzed to create color composition indices of the western areas of Thailand. Band 1 had a wavelength between 0.43 and 0.52 micrometers, Band 2 between 0.52 and 0.60 micrometers, Band 3 between 0.63 and 0.69 micrometers, and Band 4 between 0.76 and 0.90 micrometers. Three layers of satellite data were overlaid in non-repeating arrangements. Bands showing grayscale were substituted by three additive primary colors of blue, green, and red. The arrangements were permutated into 24 indices: 123, 124, 132, 134, 142, 143, 213, 214, 231, 234, 241, 243, 312, 314, 321, 324, 341, 342, 412, 413, 421, 423, 431, and 432. The data of color composition indices were then analyzed to create the land-use indices. The visual interpretation of the three levels of land-use classification were used in this procedure. The result was a land-use classification with 15 indices: City, Commercial, and Services; Airport; Golf Course; Paddy Field; Field Crop; Perennial; Aquacultural Land; Shrimp Farm; Evergreen Forest; Deciduous Forest; Mangrove Forest; Marine; River; Canal; Reservoir; and Road.

AB Crop yield estimation has significant importance for policy makers to make timely dicisions on import/export of particular crop. Traditionally, in Pakistan crop yield estimation is being carried out by Village Master Sampling (VMS) that is laborious and time-consuming. Satellite imagery is also being used as an alternative to estimate vegetation health and yield. Various vegetation indices are being used for the purpose however, their efficiency to estimate yield has not been tested. In this study, a comparison was performed among various satellite-based vegetation indices e.g. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), to evaluate most appropriate index that performs better in cropping area of irrigated Indus Basin (a complex basin with spatially heterogeneous land use). A stepwise regression based model was developed for remotely sensed crop (i.e. Wheat) using multi-band MODIS and Landsat 8 products based on Land use and Land cover map developed by Semi-Supervised Classification. The results revealed that SAVI showed a fairly acceptable association with reported yield data as compared to other indices. The correlation coefficient (R-2) was estimated at 0.60. Yield estimated by SAVI obtained from Landsat 8 showed good results with R-2 and Pearson correlation (r), estimated at 0.74 and 0.88 as compared to SAVI obtained from MODIS with 0.63 and 0.79 respectively. The results support that SAVI vegetation indices is reliable for quick and efficient wheat area mapping under Pakistani's farm conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping crop types and land cover in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa remains a challenge due to data costs, high cloud cover, and poor temporal resolution of satellite data. With improvement in satellite technology and image processing techniques, there is a potential for integrating data from sensors with different spectral characteristics and temporal resolutions to effectively map crop types and land cover. In our Malawi study area, it is common that there are no cloud-free images available for the entire crop growth season. The goal of this experiment is to produce detailed crop type and land cover maps in agricultural landscapes using the Sentinel-1 (S-1) radar data, Sentinel-2 (S-2) optical data, S-2 and PlanetScope data fusion, and S-1 C-2 matrix and S-1 H/alpha polarimetric decomposition. We evaluated the ability to combine these data to map crop types and land cover in two smallholder farming locations. The random forest algorithm, trained with crop and land cover type data collected in the field, complemented with samples digitized from Google Earth Pro and DigitalGlobe, was used for the classification experiments. The results show that the S-2 and PlanetScope fused image + S-1 covariance (C-2) matrix + H/alpha polarimetric decomposition (an entropy-based decomposition method) fusion outperformed all other image combinations, producing higher overall accuracies (OAs) (>85%) and Kappa coefficients (>0.80). These OAs represent a 13.53% and 11.7% improvement on the Sentinel-2-only (OAs < 80%) experiment for Thimalala and Edundu, respectively. The experiment also provided accurate insights into the distribution of crop and land cover types in the area. The findings suggest that in cloud-dense and resource-poor locations, fusing high temporal resolution radar data with available optical data presents an opportunity for operational mapping of crop types and land cover to support food security and environmental management decision-making.

AB Daily polar-orbiting satellite MODIS thermal detections since 2002 were used as the baseline for quantifying wildfire activity in the mixed grass and agricultural lands of southernmost central Canada. This satellite thermal detection record includes both the responsible use of fire (e.g. for clearing crop residues, grassland ecosystem management, and traditional burning) and wildfires in grasslands and agricultural lands that pose a risk to communities and other values. A database of known wildfire evacuations and fires otherwise requiring suppression assistance from provincial forest fire agencies was used to train a model that classified satellite fire detections based on weather, seasonality, and other environmental conditions. A separate dataset of high resolution (Landsat 8 thermal anomalies) of responsible agricultural fire use (e.g. crop residue burning) was collected and used to train the classification model to the converse. Key common attributes of wildfires in the region included occurrence on or before the first week of May with high rates of grass curing, wind speeds over 30 kmh(-1), relative humidity values typically below 40 %, and fires that are detected in the mid-afternoon or evening. Overall, grassland wildfire is found to be restricted to a small number of days per year, allowing for the future development of public awareness and warning systems targeted to the identified subset of weather and phenological conditions.

ID SPATIAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB GIS applications involve applying classification algorithms to remotely sensed images to determine information about a specific region on the Earth's surface. These images are very useful sources of geographical data commonly used to classify land cover, analyze crop conditions, assess mineral and petroleum deposits and quantify urban growth. In this paper, we propose a semantic supervised clustering approach to classify multispectral information in satellite images. We use the maximum likelihood method to generate the clustering. In addition, we complement the analysis applying spatial semantics to determine the training sites and refine the classification. The approach considers the a priori knowledge of the remotely sensed images to define the classes related to the geographic environment. In this case, the properties and relations that involve the geo-image define the spatial semantics; these features are used to determine the training data sites. The method attempts to improve the supervised clustering, adding the intrinsic semantics of multispectral satellite images in order to establish the classes that involve the analysis with more precision.

AB In this study, an evaluation of fuzzy-based classifiers for specific crop identification using multi-spectral temporal data spanning over one growing season has been carried out. The temporal data sets have been georeferenced with 0.3 pixel rms error. Temporal information of cotton crop has been incorporated through the following five indices: simple ratio (SR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), transformed normalized difference vegetation index (TNDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and triangular vegetation index (TVI), to study the effect of indices on classified output. For this purpose, a comparative study between two fuzzy-based soft classification approaches, possibilistic c-means (PCM) and noise classifier (NC), was undertaken. In this study, advanced wide field sensor (AWiFS) data for soft classification and linear imaging self scanner sensor (LISS III) data for soft testing purpose from Resourcesat-1 (IRS-P6) satellite were used. It has been observed that NC fuzzy classifier using TNDVI temporal index - dataset 2, which comprises four temporal images performs better than PCM classifier giving highest fuzzy overall accuracy of 96.03%.

AB The integration of cover crops (CC) into annual crop rotations improves the provision of multiple ecosystem services in time and represents an alternative paradigm to achieve sustainability goals. In spite of the benefits that several authors have exposed, CC are seldom included in rotations because their water consumption could affect cash crops development. We evaluated the possibility of including CC in the agricultural area of Rio de la Plata grasslands and identified its optimal duration depending on both environmental conditions and crop rotations. Fallow areas were located based on NDVI time series derived from MOMS satellite images and the influence of CC on the subsequent cash crop was evaluated based on modeled changes in soil water contents at the sowing date of the cash crop. Our land use classifications revealed that single crop rotations, mostly summer crops with winter fallow periods, occupy a large proportion (89%) of the agricultural portion of the Rio de la Plata grasslands studied. In most of the region, sowing CC of 3 to 5 months of length during fallow periods had little impact on soil water contents at the sowing date of the following cash crop. As expected, the optimal CC duration in the different sub-regions increased with the average rainfall occurred during the fallow period. The possibility of sowing CC without affecting cash crops yields opens the opportunity for intensifying crop sequences in the region, oriented to mitigate environmental concerns raised by monocultures and agricultural simplification.

TI CHANGES IN WILD ASS (EQUUS-HEMIONUS-KHUR) HABITAT CONDITIONS IN
   LITTLE-RANN-OF-KUTCH, GUJARAT FROM A REMOTE-SENSING PERSPECTIVE
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Rann of Kutch, Gujarat is the only habitat for one of the endangered sub-species of the Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus khur) and most of the population survives in the Wild Ass Sanctuary in Little Rann of Kutch.  The area is a saline desert with extremely sparse cover of vegetation.  In the past, the habitat supported a thriving population of wild asses.  However, due to extensive changes in the land-use around the Rann of Kutch, there has been an increase in the conflict of interests between man and the wild ass.  The present paper seeks to analyse the situation with respect to changes in land-use, vegetation cover and salt cultivation to plan proper habitat management inside the sanctuary to mitigate the problem of crop predation by the wild ass through the use of high resolution satellite data.
   The Survey of India (SOI) topographic maps of 1960 vintage were used to estimate the past habitat, land-use, vegetal cover and salt fields.  The SOI topographic maps and false colour composites provided a limited number of land-use classes for a meaningful comparison of land-use changes.  This data has been compared with digitally classified SPOT MLA on SIPS (Satellite Image Processing System, Hyderabad).  Various techniques such as principal component analysis, normalized difference vegetation index, unsupervised and supervised classifications were carried to classify various features.  Of these techniques, supervised classification provided very useful results for an effective interpretation.  It was observed that there has been an increase in irrigated crop fields.  This has resulted in enhanced crop predation by wild asses thereby triggering human-wild ass conflicts.  The digital interpretation provided crucial information on a number of classes of land-use relevant to the habitat of wild ass.  An operational basis of deriving such information for formulating effective conservation strategies is presented.

AB Data fusion methodologies have been implemented in agricultural applications with different types of sensors. One of the problems in delineating cultivation areas is the mixture of spectral signatures due to the transitions between the types of cultivation, built areas, and other natural covers. In order to improve discrimination and identification of crop types, structure data fusion techniques were evaluated. This article aims at showing the potential of using satellite data from the European Space Agency, both optical and SAR, in order to improve land cover classification of agricultural land located in Mexico. To achieve this, an analysis of the spectral, spatial and textural data was performed. Specifically, two classification algorithms were used and compared. The first is based on vector support machines and the second one on Random Forests. The methodology was applied for the study of 4 types of crops in 2017 in the municipality of Villa de Arriaga located in the state of San Luis Potosi. As final results, maps were obtained with the areas with a kappa greater than 0.80.

AB The exploitation of new high revisit frequency satellite observations is an important opportunity for agricultural applications. The Sentinel-2 for Agriculture project S2Agri (http://www.esa-sen2agri.org/SitePages/Home.aspx) is designed to develop, demonstrate and facilitate the Sentinel-2 time series contribution to the satellite EO component of agriculture monitoring for many agricultural systems across the globe. In the framework of this project, this article studies the construction of a dynamic cropland mask. This mask consists of a binary annual-cropland/no-annual-cropland map produced several times during the season to serve as a mask for monitoring crop growing conditions over the growing season. The construction of the mask relies on two classical pattern recognition techniques: feature extraction and classification. One pixel- and two object-based strategies are proposed and compared. A set of 12 test sites are used to benchmark the methods and algorithms with regard to the diversity of the agro-ecological context, landscape patterns, agricultural practices and actual satellite observation conditions. The classification results yield promising accuracies of around 90% at the end of the agricultural season. Efforts will be made to transition this research into operational products once Sentinel-2 data become available.

AB The greyback canegrub (Dermolepida albohirtum) is the main pest of sugarcane crops in all cane-growing regions between Mossman (16.5 degrees S) and Sarina (21.5 degrees S) in Queensland, Australia. In previous years, high infestations have cost the industry up to $40 million. However, identifying damage in the field is difficult due to the often impenetrable nature of the sugarcane crop. Satellite imagery offers a feasible means of achieving this by examining the visual characteristics of stool tipping, changed leaf color, and exposure of soil in damaged areas. The objective of this study was to use geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and high-spatial resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery for three years to map canegrub damage and develop two mapping approaches suitable for risk mapping. The GEOBIA mapping approach for canegrub damage detection was evaluated over three selected study sites in Queensland, covering a total of 254km(2) and included five main steps developed in the eCognition Developer software. These included: (1) initial segmentation of sugarcane block boundaries; (2) classification and subsequent omission of fallow/harvested fields, tracks, and other non-sugarcane features within the block boundaries; (3) identification of likely canegrub-damaged areas with low NDVI values and high levels of image texture within each block; (4) the further refining of canegrub damaged areas to low, medium, and high likelihood; and (5) risk classification. The validation based on field observations of canegrub damage at the time of the satellite image capture yielded producer's accuracies between 75% and 98.7%, depending on the study site. Error of commission occurred in some cases due to sprawling, drainage issues, wind, weed, and pig damage. The two developed risk mapping approaches were based on the results of the canegrub damage detection. This research will improve decision making by growers affected by canegrub damage.

AB In the past few years, segmentation and classification techniques have become a cornerstone of many successful remote sensing algorithms aiming at delineating geographic target objects. One common strategy relies on using multiple complex features to guide the delineation process with the objective of gathering complementary information for improving classification results. However, a persistent problem in this approach is how to combine different and noncorrelated feature descriptors automatically. In this regard, one solution is to combine them through multiple classifier systems (MCSs) in which the diversity of simple/non-complex classifiers is an essential issue in the definition of appropriate strategies for classifier fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for selecting classifiers (whereby a classifier is taken as a pair of learning method plus image descriptor) to be combined in MCS. In the proposed solution, diversity measures are used to assess the degree of agreement/disagreement between pairs of classifiers and ranked lists are created to sort them according to their diversity score. Thereafter, the classifiers are also sorted according to their performance through different evaluation measures (e. g., kappa and tau indices). In the end, a rank aggregation method is proposed to select the most suitable classifiers based on both the diversity and the effectiveness performance of classifiers. The proposed fusion framework has targeted at coffee crop classification and urban recognition but it is general enough to be used in a variety of other pattern recognition problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel strategy yields good results when compared to several baselines while using fewer classifiers and being much more efficient.

AB Pre-harvest crop mapping, the fundamental requirement for many of the crop management decisions, continues to be challenging either due to cloud cover in satellite images or due to spectral separability issues. These limitations are overcome in this study by using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and deep learning technique. Two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) architecture is applied on multi-temporal SAR data of Sentinel-1 to classify soybean, jowar, cotton and sugarcane crops in a large geographic area located in a Central Indian state. Classification experiments are conducted with full season data from nine overpasses in three modes namely VH alone, VH and VH/VV ratio, and VH and VV, and these experimental results reveal that VH and VV combination performed better with an overall accuracy of 91.75% as compared to 84.96% and 88.75% respectively by others. Classification performances with three sets of temporal data, covering part of the season, reveal that crop map can be generated as early as 27th August (i.e. roughly 45 days prior harvesting) with an accuracy of 89.15% slightly less than the mapping accuracy achieved with full season data (i.e. till 14th October). 2D-CNN algorithm has performed better than SVM and RF techniques. This methodology can be extended to similar agro-ecological regions of the country. Richly available SAR data from Sentinel-1 and the potential of deep learning techniques for recognising complex phenological patterns offer immense opportunities for early-season crop mapping even during monsoon season in tropical countries like India.

AB Site-specific weed management implies detecting the location of weeds in order to generate maps of their spatial distribution. This information facilitates a more accurate application of herbicides, spraying them in the exact areas of weed growth and in the required doses. In order to explore the potential of commercial satellites to discriminate and map weeds, we used the information contained in high spatial resolution images acquired by the QuickBird satellite to assess the density of sterile oat (Avena sterilis) present in a winter barley field at two different dates (March and June). Our results confirmed the potential of using satellite images in the spectral discrimination of weed patches in infested fields. The results of binary logistic regressions showed that the best matches in the classification of three categories (low, medium, or high sterile oat densities) corresponded to the March image. QuickBird's March image provided reliable estimates of sterile oat patches in barley crops when weed density was relatively high (between 86% and 94% of agreement between predicted and observed densities). However, when weed densities were lower than 10 plants/m(2) there were serious difficulties to distinguish them from weed-free zones (between 72 and 75% of global agreement in the classification) with large underestimation of medium density weed patches (10 plants/m(2)). This is a potential limitation considering than the thresholds used for herbicide application decisions are generally close to this density. However, the information obtained may still be useful for producing field maps to describe the spatial distribution of this weed. Moreover, these studies have provided valuable information on the best spectral regions and/or vegetation indices for approaching discrimination between sterile oat and cereal crops and the most suitable period for it.

AB Detecting plant health condition plays an important role in controlling disease and insect pest stresses in agricultural crops. In this study, we applied support vector classification machine (SVC) and principal components analysis (PCA) techniques for discriminating and classifying the normal and stressed paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves caused by rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guen). The hyperspectral reflectance of paddy rice leaves was measured through the full wavelength range from 350 to 2500nm under the laboratory condition. The hyperspectral response characteristic analysis of rice leaves indicated that the stressed leaves presented a higher reflectance in the visible (430 similar to 470 nm, 490-610 nm and 610 similar to 680 nm) and one shortwave infrared (2080 similar to 2350 nm) region, and a lower reflectance in the near infrared (780 similar to 890 nm) and the other shortwave infrared (1580 similar to 1750 nm) region than the normal leaves. PCA was performed to obtain the principal components (PCs) derived from the raw and first derivative reflectance (FDR) spectra. The nonlinear support vector classification machine (referred to as C-SVC) was employed to differentiate the normal and stressed leaves with the front several PCs as the independent variables of C-SVC model. Classification accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient. OA of C-SVC with PCA derived from both the raw and FDR spectra for the testing dataset were 100%, and the corresponding Kappa coefficients were 1. Our results would suggest that it's capable of discriminating the stressed rice leaves from normal ones using hyperspectral remote sensing data under the laboratory condition.

AB In Central Asia, actual cotton rotation practices are repeatedly believed to resemble "Soviet cropping conditions" with continuous cotton sequences of six years or more. We investigated current cotton growing patterns in Khorezm, one representative cotton production region in Uzbekistan utilizing time series of 250-m MODIS satellite data. A Random Forest model was established using reference data of 2004-2007 to generate annual crop maps in 2000-2009. A linear model was applied to assess the spatial distribution of the longest observed cotton sequence within the ten-year observation period. All cotton-growing sequences were compared to the national crop rotation recommendations.
   The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82%. We found that cotton remains the major crop in the region. It was cultivated for more than five out of the ten years on 46.5% of the cropland. But "Soviet cropping conditions" on less than 20% and officially recommended cotton sequences on more than 50% of the cropland challenge the notion that cotton mono-crop dominates Central Asia. Statistical analysis revealed that long cotton sequences preferably occur on fields far from settlements and under reduced soil suitability for irrigation. The results enable decision makers to better explain unfavourable cotton cultivation practices and to stimulate improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper proposes a prototype of an algorithm based on the use of machine vision methods, which allows automatic identification and selection of fields sown with agricultural crops on images. The algorithm works with satellite images and consists of two stages. At the first stage, the image undergoes initial processing, after which edge detection and contour finding algorithms are applied to it. At the second stage, the obtained image areas enclosed within the contours are represented as a set of numerical and logical parameters which are used for filtering and classification of the areas.

AB Hyperion- a hyperspectral sensor is carried on NASA's EO1 satellite. This study was carried out for Lonar area of Jalna district, Maharashtra using data of January 2008. Hyperion data contains 242 spectral bands ranging from 356 to 2577 nm out of which 196 calibrated bands (bands: 8-57 and 79-224) are used for further processing. Level 1 product (.L1R) for which only radiometric correction was applied is used for this study. To get the complete advantage of hyperspectral data atmospheric correction is essential. FLAASH, a very effective code for hyperspectral data available in ENVI is applied for atmospheric correction. The atmospherically corrected image contains 168 bands after removing absorption bands. As a first measure principal component and band correlation analysis based spectral subset is applied for optimum band selection for vegetation application. Field study was conducted in January 2009 to collect field spectra. Spectral library was built for major three crops of the study area i.e. chana, jawar and wheat by spectra collected from the field. As a second measure before classification NDVI value based mask is applied to differentiate agricultural areas from other vegetated areas and non vegetated area. After discarding other areas, crop classification is carried out only in the agricultural area. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) a very popular algorithm for hyperspectral image classification is applied for image classification and accuracy assessment is carried out.

AB Image data from Earth Observation Satellites (EDS) were used to analyse mountain landscape changes in Northeast Portugal. Three Landsat images, from April 30th 1979, March 14th 1989 and May 29th 2002 were used. A supervised classification was performed for each image based on the radiometric information and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Eleven classes were selected considering the main land cover types in the region. The classification results showed high overall accuracy (above 92.5%) and kappa coefficient (above 0.91). Broadly, the range of dates of the Landsat images used allowed for the differentiation between classes. Nevertheless, some problems occurred in differentiating between classes of forest and shrub vegetation due to similar characteristics and vegetation conditions in some periods of the year, and also due to the effects of topographic shadows associated to mountain areas. Meadows and annual crops were the classes having greater changes from 1979 to 2002: meadows area increased 60% while annual crops decreased 43.5%. The increase in meadows area was likely due to policies supporting agroenvironmental conservation and autochthon bovine livestock production. Differently, the decrease in annual crops was likely due to the loss of economical competitiveness of main annual crops and to the rural population decrease and ageing, which favoured the replacement of arable lands by permanent meadows. These results may help developing policies and measures for sustainable management of traditional mountain rural landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing demands for lasting and environmentally conscious use of natural resources together with a cost effective and restrictive use of fertilizers and pesticides require the employment of new technologies in agriculture. The preliminary results presented here consist in the automatic land use classification of agricultural fields based on multi-temporal TerraSAR-X images in dual polarization obtained in the high resolution Spotlight mode of the satellite. The classified data in turn can be used to enhance and validate existing models on ground water quality as a function of agricultural usage and soil treatment. Within the past years investigations have been carried out on the usefulness of ENVISAT ASAR dual polarimetric data for environmental mapping in the same area, which show some deficiencies mainly because of the spatial resolution of the data, which was too coarse for many cultivations and could not reflect agricultural treatments (irrigation, fertilization, soil and plant treatment) sufficiently. However, the ENVISAT investigations showed that a proper selection of images out of a time series according to the crop-calendar of that region is beneficial and gives in general more accurate results than using all of the images. This is due to the fact that some fields are covered by different types of crops during the year and such sequence is often hard to model because it is usually governed by phenologic, ecologic, and economic reasons. The latter might be influenced either from sudden change of global or national economic constraints (e.g., oil prize, taxes, and subsidies), by strategies of individual farmers, or both. In this paper, results obtained from multi-temporal classifications of TerraSAR-X image pairs (HH and VV) covering a whole season (11 images from March to November) are presented. Even though the temporal grid was irregular (revisit time was nine times 22 days and once 44 days) in every month at least one pair was available. The investigations and results are based on standard pixel based Maximum Likelihood classification techniques, which however are amended by the use of regional crop calendar conditions and rules to account for seasonal variations of specific cultivations with respect to permanent crops. Results obtained have been compared to ground truth, which has been carried out in-situ to the satellite measurements. It can be shown that even when not using all images of the year, but only those which are indicated by the crop-calendar or those which show high loadings using Factor Analysis a considerable classification accuracy of more than 90% can be achieved. Besides, the crop-calendar, which has been set-up using ground observations can be verified or sometimes improved by this method. The accuracy obtained, can be improved by different types of pre-processing (i.e., filtering) as is demonstrated. Some remaining discrepancies for some species can be explained by investigating the structural behaviour of the plants on ground as compared to close range photos being taken during ground truth. As could be demonstrated the use of time-series of images from TerraSAR-X despite of frequent cloud cover offers an excellent tool for monitoring crops and serve as indicator for the estimation of the amount of fertilizers used within that area. Using this information, farmers could improve their efforts in establishing good agricultural practice, as being claimed by recent legal and environmental jurisdiction.
   In future work the validity of this work, which is limited by the small amount of training and control fields will be extended and also other modern classification techniques applied, such as support vector machine.

AB Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency creates the "JAXA High Resolution Land-Use and Land-Cover Map (JHR LULC Map)" in Japan. The data was acquired by the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2), onboard the Advanced Land Observation Satellite. Ortho-rectification, atmospheric and slope correction were applied to the AVNIR-2 data. The number of the input data for the classification is 1,876 scenes which were acquired from April 28, 2006 to April 15, 2011. The classification categories are 1) water, 2) urban, 3) paddy, 4) crop, 5) grass, 6) deciduous forest, 7) evergreen forest, 8) bare land, and 9) snow and ice. Pixel spacing of the JHR LULC Map is 0.000278 degrees and 0.000333 degrees for the latitude and longitude, respectively. The temporal classification accuracy was found to be 89.3%, which was calculated using the validated accuracy of the classification multiplied by the surface ratio in each category by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

AB This research was part of a 1997 NASA-USDA collaborative research study for regional mapping of soil moisture in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. The study was conducted during a transition from winter to summer crops in June and July. Classification techniques were developed using Landsat TM data to separate the transitional vegetation from the natural vegetation. Areal photography and associated ground truth data for selected areas were used in developing the spectral signatures for each vegetation class. Classification of the entire region used these signatures. This research suggests techniques to be used in mapping vegetation classes in a very mixed land use area and suggests ways of using multi temporal satellite imagery for separating vegetation classes and minimizing cloud cover problems.

AB This paper demonstrates that multitemporal satellite SAR images are most suitable for monitoring the rapid changes of cultivation systems in a subtropical region. A new method is proposed by applying case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to the classification of SAR images. Stratified sampling is carried out to collect the cases so that the variations of backscatters within a class can be appropriately captured. The use of discrete cases can conveniently represent the internal changes of a class under complicated situations, such as spatial changes in soil conditions and terrain features. These spatial variations are difficult to represent by using rules or mathematical equations. The proposed method has better classification performance than supervised classification methods in the study area. The case library is reusable for time-independent classification when the SAR images are acquired at the same time of the crop growth cycles for different years. The proposed method has been tested in the Pearl River Delta in South China. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Classifying spectrally similar crop types in fragmented landscapes is a difficult task due to the low spectral and spatial resolution of satellite imagery. The objective of this study is twofold: (I) to evaluate the performance of a recent ensemble methodology, namely canonical correlation forest (CCF), and (ii) to investigate the potential of recently launched Sentinel-2 (S-2) image for crop classification. The algorithmis based on building a forest-type ensemble model using multiple canonical correlation trees. Its performance was compared to widely-used random forest (RF) and rotation forest (RotFor) for the classification of 4-band and 10-band S-2 and Landsat-8 (L-8) OLI datasets. In addition to overall accuracy estimations, results of the methods were assessed using recently introduced map-level and category-level disagreement measures. Results showed that the CCF and RotFor algorithms produced statistically similar results for the S-2 datasets but statistically different results for the OLI image whilst outperforming the RF algorithm for all cases. The CCF algorithm was found less sensitive to the ensemble size (i.e. number of trees) compared to RF algorithm. Also, for the S-2 data inclusion of six spectral bands at 20 m resolution resulted in a significant increase in classification accuracy (up to 6%).

AB Reliable crop maps are a vital source of information for many economic sectors. Hyperspectral images and efficient supervised classification algorithms can help in obtaining these maps. One of the objectives is to use a spectroradiometer as a source of a priori information for training supervised classification algorithms. Although there are many supervised classification algorithms, few can be trained using collected spectral signatures, such as spectral angle mapper (SAM). This algorithm relies on setting the angle threshold values manually to separate different classes, and it is usually a random process. So, the second objective is to use an automated process to optimize the angle threshold values to improve the efficiency of the SAM algorithm. An innovative cooperative classification algorithm for hyperspectral images based on enhancing the supervised SAM algorithm performance using a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented. The improvement is based on selecting global optimal threshold angle values for different classes using GA. The efficiency of the developed cooperative evolutionary algorithm is proved by classifying hyperspectral images to create maps of major crops, such as wheat, potato, and alfalfa. The source of the hyperspectral images is the Compact High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard of the Proba satellite. The evaluation of the results showed that the new cooperative evolutionary algorithm classified hyperspectral images with the highest accuracy compared to well-known reliable supervised classification algorithms.

ID INFORMATION; IMAGERY; OBJECTS
AB This paper proposes a land cover classification methodology in agricultural contexts that provides satisfactory results with a single satellite image per year acquired during the growing period. Our approach incorporates ancillary data such as cropping history (inter-annual crop rotations), context ( altitude, soil type) and structure ( parcels size and shape) to compensate for the lack of radiometric data resulting from the use of a single image. The originality of the proposed method resides in the three successive steps used: S1: per-pixel classification of a single SPOT XS image with a restricted number of land cover classes (RL) chosen to ensure good accuracy; S2: conversion of RLs into a per-parcel classification system using ancillary parcel boundaries; and S3: parcel allocation using exhaustive land cover classes (EL) and its refinement through the application of decision rules. The method was tested on a 120 km(2) area (Sousson river basin, Gers, France) where exhaustive knowledge of land cover for two successive years allowed complete validation of our method. It allocated 87% of the parcels with a 75% accuracy rate according to the exhaustive list ( EL). This is a satisfactory result obtained with one SPOT XS image in a small agricultural parcel context.

AB Discrete-state Markov random fields on regular arrays have played a significant role in spatial statistics and image analysis. For example, they are used to represent objects against background in computer vision and pixel-based classification of a region into different crop types in remote sensing. Convenience has generally favoured formulations that involve only pairwise interactions. Such models are in themselves unrealistic and, although they often perform surprisingly well in tasks such as the restoration of degraded images, they are unsatisfactory for many other purposes. In this paper, we consider particular forms of Markov random fields that involve higher-order interactions and therefore are better able to represent the large-scale properties of typical spatial scenes. Interpretations of the parameters are given and realizations from a variety of models are produced via Markov chain Monte Carlo. Potential applications are illustrated in two examples. The first concerns Bayesian image analysis and confirms that pairwise-interaction priors may perform very poorly for image functionals such as number of objects, even when restoration apparently works well. The second example describes a model for a geological dataset and obtains maximum-likelihood parameter estimates using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Despite the complexity of the formulation, realizations of the estimated model suggest that the representation is quite realistic.

TI Integrating multiple texture methods and NDVI to the Random Forest
   classification algorithm to detect tea and hazelnut plantation areas in
   northeast Turkey
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Hazelnuts and tea are two major agricultural crops grown in the eastern Black Sea region in Turkey. Since this part of Turkey is not industrialized, most of the local people work in agriculture, making hazelnuts and tea a part of their lives. For the government side, it is crucial to keep records of the amount of harvested croplands to implement agricultural policies. In fact, the harvested area and crop type of each cadastral parcel are collected either during cadastral surveys or with the declaration of individual farmers, yet this information is mostly not up-to-date and does not reflect the current land-use status. This study aims to determine the extent and distribution of hazelnuts and tea grown areas using the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. Tea and hazelnuts give similar spectral reflectance values to surrounding vegetation, which makes it difficult to distinguish them using only their spectral properties. To tackle this problem, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and texture extraction methods such as the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gabor filter were integrated with the RF algorithm, and their contributions to the success of the RF classification method were examined. WorldView-2 satellite images, which have eight multispectral bands (MS: 2 m) and one higher spatial resolution panchromatic band (PAN: 0.5 m), were used. Since the study area contains agricultural products grown in different seasons, satellite images belonging to both summer and winter periods were used. Preliminary results acquired using only spectral values indicated that the RF method gives 79.05% and 71.84% overall accuracies for summer and winter periods, respectively. Integrating texture information improves the performance of the RF algorithm such that the overall classification accuracies are increased to 83.54% and 87.89% when texture information extracted with GLCM and the Gabor filter is added. The classification performance of the winter image is also boosted to be 77.41% and 79.73% with the contribution of texture information obtained with GLCM and the Gabor filter, respectively. Finally, produced thematic maps were compared with the latest cadastral maps to validate classification results with ground truth data. The obtained results reveal the success of integrating texture features in classification since the created thematic maps are consistent with actual land use. The results also show that the crops grown on some cadastral parcels are not coherent with the most current cadastral database, which implies that the cadastral maps need to be updated.

AB Plant traits are used to define species, but also to evaluate the health status of forests, plantations and crops. Conventional methods of measuring plant traits (e.g. wet chemistry), although accurate, are inefficient and costly when applied over large areas or with intensive sampling. Spectroscopic methods, as used in the food industry and mineralogy, are nowadays applied to identify plant traits, however, most studies analysed visible to near infrared, while infrared spectra of longer wavelengths have been little used for identifying the spectral differences between plant species. This study measured the infrared spectra (1.4-16.0 mu m) on individual, fresh leaves of 19 species (from herbaceous to woody species), as well as 14 leaf traits for each leaf. The results describe at which wavelengths in the infrared the leaves' spectra can differentiate most effectively between these plant species. A Quadratic Discrimination Analysis (QDA) shows that using five bands in the SWIR or the LWIR is enough to accurately differentiate these species (Kappa: 0.93, 0.94 respectively), while the MWIR has a lower classification accuracy (Kappa: 0.84). This study also shows that in the infrared spectra of fresh leaves, the identified species specific features are correlated with leaf traits as well as changes in their values. Spectral features in the SWIR (1.66, 1.89 and 2.00 mu m) are common to all species and match the main features of pure cellulose and lignin spectra. The depth of these features varies with changes of cellulose and leaf water content and can be used to differentiate species in this region. In the MWIR and LWIR, the absorption spectra of leaves are formed by key species-specific traits including lignin, cellulose, water, nitrogen and leaf thickness. The connection found in this study between leaf traits, features and spectral signatures are novel tools to assist when identifying plant species by spectroscopy and remote sensing.

AB Earth Observation data give high potential to assess the biomass of vegetation. Initially, methods of deriving information on vegetation growth conditions and biomass were based on optical data, collected by environmental satellites with sensors of different resolutions (low and high-resolution satellite images). However due to frequent clouds cover, the application of multi-temporal SAR data proved to be very useful for classification of vegetation and application for biomass assessment. The presented paper gives an overview of the state-of-the art in the field of radar applications for vegetation studies with the special emphasis put to evaluation of biomass. Applications of different types of SAR sensors are presented for two types of vegetation relevant for biomass production: agricultural crops and forests. As far as forests are concerned, multiple approaches are presented, which apply various radar wavelengths (C-band, L-band, P-band) and different wave polarizations (VV, HH, HV). Results from regression analyses with forest variables: biomass, height, dbh (diameter-breast-height) and total stem number were demonstrated with conclusions concerning optimal choice of radar band and polarization for assessment of these variables with high accuracy. Usefulness of various radar techniques was tested, like PPD (Polarization Phased Difference), or semi-empirical algorithms based on a two layer radar backscatter model. Also applicability of special indices, useful for better assessment of forest biomass, like BCI (Biomass Consolidation Index), which is the combination of biomass density (t/ha) and stand consolidation (amount of trees per ha), was presented. Analogous analysis of recent achievements was done for SAR applications related to agricultural crops. Conclusions concerning optimal SAR wavelengths and polarizations for crop type mapping were presented, including own Author's experience in crop classification based on various SAR sensors (X and L bands). Results concerning interactions of a backscatter signal with soil and vegetation were demonstrated, with their implications on accuracy of biomass assessment. Methods incorporating multi-frequency polarimetric SAR into the crop canopy models aimed at obtaining physical parameters related to biomass, as Leaf Area Index and crop height, were discussed. Finally, the summary table, presenting possibilities of applications and ordering data from different sensors (past and present), wavelengths, polarizations, spatial resolutions for assessment of various vegetation parameters, with the special emphasis put to biomass, was created as a result of the study.

AB Geographic variation in the appearance of objects on Earth is readily observable in remotely sensed imagery (RSI) and somewhat intuitive to understand for most people - many classes of objects (houses, vehicles, crop fields etc.) simply look different depending on their location. This variation has recently been shown to have important implications when training machine learning models on geotagged image datasets for specific object detection and classification tasks. For example, models trained on datasets with ethnocentric biases in image content have been shown to misclassify objects in under-sampled regions, particularly in least-developed countries. The need to evaluate the growing corpus of RSI datasets for representativeness, heterogeneity and geodiversity is therefore high; yet scalable methods for measuring these concepts are absent in the remote sensing domain. This paper introduces the first dataset analysis methods for detecting and assessing geodiversity problems in large RSI datasets, based on geospatial adaptations of the Frechet Inception Distance and Inception Score in the deep learning framework. Geospatial Frechet Distance is proposed as a dissimilarity measure for image features of an object class across geographic regions - useful for comparing differences in object class appearance in different locations and/or spatial scales. A complementary Geospatial Inception Score is proposed to quantify heterogeneity of geographic context present in dataset labels within particular regions/locations, taking into account the labels themselves as well as their immediate surroundings. Rigorous tests of these methods on simulated RSI datasets demonstrate their stability, sensitivity, and the broad range of dataset analyses to which they can be applied.

AB Paddy is one of the most important agricultural crop in Indonesia. Indonesia's consumption of rice per capita in 2013 amounted to 78,82 kg/capita/year. In 2017, the Indonesian government has the mission of realizing Indonesia became self-sufficient in food. Therefore, the Indonesian government should be able to seek the stability of the fulfillment of basic needs for food, such as rice field mapping. The accurate mapping for rice field can use a quick and easy method such as Remote Sensing. In this study, multi-temporal Landsat 8 are used for identification of rice field based on Rice Planting Time. It was combined with other method for extract information from the imagery. The methods which was used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and band combination. Image classification is processed by using nine classes, those are water, settlements, mangrove, gardens, fields, rice fields 1st, rice fields 2nd, rice fields 3rd and rice fields 4th. The results showed the rice fields area obtained from the PCA method was 50,009 ha, combination bands was 51,016 ha and NDVI method was 45,893 ha. The accuracy level was obtained PCA method (84.848%), band combination (81.818%), and NDVI method (75.758%).

AB The UAV-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been extensively used in various agriculture applications. The data calibration and pre-processing techniques have been widely studied in the remote sensing research. However, it was ignored that the most important factor affecting the results accuracy is the quality of the spectral data. To acquire such high spectral quality, the bi-directional reflection should be optimally adjusted during the data processing according to radiative transfer equation (RTE) based Hapke's model. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship of bi-directional reflectance (BRDF) correction on two crop (Canola and Wheat) varieties in the context of hyperspectral data robustness. The simulated dataset based on the radiative transfer parameters are used to evaluate the influence of source-sensor geometry, light illumination, and scattering on data quality and it's ability on data correction using proposed spectral similarity measures (SID-SAM score). The RTE-based BRDF optimization method (Hapke model) is proposed for improving the hyperspectral data quality after comparing with the uncorrected datasets. Simulated results shows that the optimization have significantly improved the data quality and increased the signal accuracy. Hence, the bi-directional reflectance correction would definitely have advantages on the hyperspectral data analysis to improve classification results.

AB Using remote sensing to monitor large forest areas usually requires large field datasets. The need for extensive data collection can be reduced through interpretation of several images simultaneously. This study focused evaluating the accuracy and functionality of stand volume models in overlapping multi-temporal images that could form large areas covering a mosaic of scenes. Various atmospheric correction methods were tested to generalize field information outside the coverage of single images. A dataset consisting of three overlapping Landsat ETM+ images taken on different dates was used to compare atmospheric correction methods with uncorrected raw data. The methods tested were 6S, SMAC, and Dos. Aerosol data from MODIS were used in retrieving parameters for the 6s algorithm. The coefficient of determination values for the regression models used in estimating the total volume of the standing crop varied from 0.46 to 0.62 and standard error from 57 to 77 m(3)/ha, depending on the image calibration method used. All the atmospheric correction methods improved the classification of the multitemporal images. In comparison to the uncorrected data, the relative RMSE values for the multitemporal images decreased by an average of 6 percent on with DOS, 14 percent with SMAC, and 15 percent with 6S.

TI Methodology to classify rice cultural types based on water regimes using
   multi-temporal RADARSAT-1 data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
ID SAR; INDIA
AB This study presents a methodology to classify rice cultural types based on water regimes using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The methodology was developed based on the theoretical understanding of radar scattering mechanisms with rice crop canopy, considering crop phenology and variation in water depth in the rice field, emphasizing the sensitivity of SAR to crop geometry and water. The logic used was the characteristic decrease in SAR backscatter that is associated with the puddled or transplanted field due to specular reflection for little exposure of crop, with increase in backscatter as the crop growth progresses due to volume scattering. Besides, the multiple interactions between SAR and vegetation/water also lead to an increase in backscatter as the crop growth progresses. Classification thresholds were established based on the information provided by each pixel in each image, the pixel's typical temporal behaviour due to crop phenology and changing water depth in rice field and their corresponding SAR signature. Based on this logic, the study site (i. e. South 24 Paraganas district, West Bengal) was classified into three major rice cultural types, namely shallow water rice (SWR; 5 cm <= water depth <= 30 cm), intermediate water rice (IWR; 30 cm <= water depth <= 50 cm) and deep water rice (DWR; water depth > 50 cm) during the kharif season. These three types represent most of the traditional rice-growing areas of India. The methodology was validated with the field data collected synchronously with the satellite passes. Classification results showed an overall accuracy of 98.5% (95.5% kappa coefficient) compared with a maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC) with an overall accuracy of 95.5% (84.2% of kappa coefficient) with 95% confidence interval. The relationship between field parameters, especially exposed plant height and water depth with SAR backscatter, was explored to design empirical models for each of the three rice classes. Significant relationships were observed in all the rice classes (coefficient of determination, R-2, value more than 0.85) even though they had similar growth profiles but varied with water depth. The two main conclusions drawn from this study are (i) the importance of multi-temporal SAR data for the classification of rice culture types based on water regimes and (ii) the advantages and flexibility of the knowledge-based classifier for classification of RADARSAT-1 data. However, being empirical, the approach needs modification according to the current rainfall pattern and rice- growing practice.

AB The study presents the preliminary results of two classification exercises assessing the capabilities of pre-operational (August 2015) Sentinel-2 (S2) data for mapping crop types and tree species. In the first case study, an S2 image was used to map six summer crop species in Lower Austria as well as winter crops/bare soil. Crop type maps are needed to account for crop-specific water use and for agricultural statistics. Crop type information is also useful to parametrize crop growth models for yield estimation, as well as for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables using radiative transfer models. The second case study aimed to map seven different deciduous and coniferous tree species in Germany. Detailed information about tree species distribution is important for forest management and to assess potential impacts of climate change. In our S2 data assessment, crop and tree species maps were produced at 10 m spatial resolution by combining the ten S2 spectral channels with 10 and 20 m pixel size. A supervised Random Forest classifier (RF) was deployed and trained with appropriate ground truth. In both case studies, S2 data confirmed its expected capabilities to produce reliable land cover maps. Cross-validated overall accuracies ranged between 65% (tree species) and 76% (crop types). The study confirmed the high value of the red-edge and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for vegetation mapping. Also, the blue band was important in both study sites. The S2-bands in the near infrared were amongst the least important channels. The object based image analysis (OBIA) and the classical pixel-based classification achieved comparable results, mainly for the cropland. As only single date acquisitions were available for this study, the full potential of S2 data could not be assessed. In the future, the two twin S2 satellites will offer global coverage every five days and therefore permit to concurrently exploit unprecedented spectral and temporal information with high spatial resolution.

AB The increasing availability of large-scale remote sensing labeled data has prompted researchers to develop increasingly precise and accurate data-driven models for land cover and crop classification (LC&CC). Moreover, with the introduction of self-attention and introspection mechanisms, deep learning approaches have shown promising results in processing long temporal sequences in the multi-spectral domain with a contained computational request. Nevertheless, most practical applications cannot rely on labeled data, and in the field, surveys are a time-consuming solution that pose strict limitations to the number of collected samples. Moreover, atmospheric conditions and specific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap that does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available dataset to the area of interest. In this paper, we investigate adversarial training of deep neural networks to bridge the domain discrepancy between distinct geographical zones. In particular, we perform a thorough analysis of domain adaptation applied to challenging multi-spectral, multi-temporal data, accurately highlighting the advantages of adapting state-of-the-art self-attention-based models for LC&CC to different target zones where labeled data are not available. Extensive experimentation demonstrated significant performance and generalization gain in applying domain-adversarial training to source and target regions with marked dissimilarities between the distribution of extracted features.

AB Agriculture is highly affected by environmental conditions and the assessment of the agroclimatic potential is necessary for sustainability and productivity. The climate is among the most important factors that determine the agricultural potentialities of a region and the suitability of a region for a specific crop, whereas the yield is determined by weather conditions. In this chapter the first objective is to identify sustainable production zones in Thessaly by conducting contemporary agroclimatic classification based on remote sensing and GIS. The agroclimatic conditions of agricultural areas have to be assessed in order to achieve sustainable and efficient use of natural resources in combination with production optimization. Thus, a quantitative understanding of the climate of a region is essential for developing improved farming systems. The second objective derives from the first; it develops a decision support system (DSS) by using multi-criteria analysis combining different criteria to a utility function under a set of constraints concerning different categories of agroclimatic, social, cultural and economic conditions and so we can achieve an optimum agricultural production plan. In order to support the realization of the proposed production zoning and DSS in real-time, a Sensor Web service platform is proposed to be implemented based on the Sensor Web technologies, which extracts Real-time environmental and agronomic data.

AB Geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies have become an important tool for visualizing conservation management and developing solutions to problems associated with conservation. When multiple organizations separately develop spatial data representations of protected areas, implicit error arises due to variation between data sets. We used boundary data produced by three conservation organizations (International Union for the Conservation of Nature, World Resource Institute, and Uganda Wildlife Authority), for seven Ugandan parks, to study variation in the size represented and the location of boundaries. We found variation in the extent of overlapping total area encompassed by the three data sources, ranging from miniscule (0.4 %) differences to quite large ones (9.0 %). To underscore how protected area boundary discrepancies may have implications to protected area management, we used a landcover classification, defining crop, shrub, forest, savanna, and grassland. The total area in the different landcover classes varied most in smaller protected areas (those less than 329 km(2)), with forest and cropland area estimates varying up to 65 %. The discrepancies introduced by boundary errors could, in this hypothetical case, generate erroneous findings and could have a significant impact on conservation, such as local-scale management for encroachment and larger-scale assessments of deforestation.

AB Timely and accurate mapping of winter crop planting areas in China is important for food security assessment at a national level. Time-series of vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are widely used for crop mapping, as they can characterize the growth cycle of crops. However, with the moderate spatial resolution optical imagery acquired by Landsat and Sentinel-2, it is difficult to obtain complete time-series curves for vegetation indices due to the influence of the revisit cycle of the satellite and weather conditions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for compositing the multi-temporal NDVI, in order to map winter crop planting areas with the Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 optical images. The algorithm composites the multi-temporal NDVI into three key values, according to two time-windowsa period of low NDVI values and a period of high NDVI valuesfor the winter crops. First, we identify the two time-windows, according to the time-series of the NDVI obtained from daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations. Second, the 30 m spatial resolution multi-temporal NDVI curve, derived from the Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 optical images, is composited by selecting the maximal value in the high NDVI value period, and the minimal and median values in the low NDVI value period, using an algorithm of the Google Earth Engine. Third, a decision tree classification method is utilized to perform the winter crop classification at a pixel level. The results indicate that this method is effective for the large-scale mapping of winter crops. In the study area, the area of winter crops in 2018 was determined to be 207,641 km(2), with an overall accuracy of 96.22% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. The method proposed in this paper is expected to contribute to the rapid and accurate mapping of winter crops in large-scale applications and analyses.

AB Sustainable management of agricultural water resources requires improved understanding of irrigation patterns in space and time. We produced annual, high-resolution (30 m) irrigation maps for 1999-2016 by combining all available Landsat satellite imagery with climate and soil covariables in Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification had accuracies from 92 to 100% and generally agreed with county statistics (r(2) = 0.88-0.96). Two novel indices that integrate plant greenness and moisture information show promise for improving satellite classification of irrigation. We found considerable interannual variability in irrigation location and extent, including a near doubling between 2002 and 2016. Statistical modeling suggested that precipitation and commodity price influenced irrigated extent through time. High prices incentivized expansion to increase crop yield and profit, but dry years required greater irrigation intensity, thus reducing area in this supply-limited region. Data sets produced with this approach can improve water sustainability by providing consistent, spatially explicit tracking of irrigation dynamics over time.
   Plain Language Summary Irrigated agriculture is the world's largest consumer of global freshwater. In order to effectively use limited water supplies, managers need to understand when and where irrigation occurs. We fill this knowledge gap by using satellite images to produce annual maps of irrigation for 1999-2016 in a large, economically important agricultural region in the central United States that must manage its water supply for multiple users. We then used these maps to study changes in irrigation over time. We were surprised to find that the total area and individual locations of irrigated fields changed substantially from year to year. Our analysis suggests that farmers expanded irrigation when crop prices were high to increase crop yield and profit. We initially expected to also see increases in drought years to compensate for lack of rainfall, but instead, we found the opposite: irrigated area decreased in dry years. Looking closer, we realized that this happened because farmers had to irrigate more heavily over each field, which reduced the number of fields they could irrigate due to limited water supply. These irrigation maps consistently track irrigation over time and are freely available for others to use to help manage water sustainably and meet food needs.

AB In this upcoming Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the use of satellite imagery is taking an increasing role for improving the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). Considering the operational aspect of the CAP monitoring process, the use of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images is highly relevant, especially in regions with a frequent cloud cover, such as Belgium. Indeed, SAR imagery does not depend on sunlight and is barely affected by the presence of clouds. Moreover, the SAR signal is particularly sensitive to the geometry and the water content of the target. Crop identification is often a pre-requisite to monitor agriculture at parcel level (ploughing, harvest, grassland mowing, intercropping, etc.) The main goal of this study is to assess the performances and constraints of a SAR-based crop classification in an operational large-scale application. The Random Forest object-oriented classification model is built on Sentinel-1 time series from January to August 2020 only. It can identify crops in the Walloon Region (south part of Belgium) with high performance: 93.4% of well-classified area, representing 88.4% of the parcels. Among the 48 crop groups, the six most represented ones get a F1-score higher or equal to 84%. Additionally, this research documents how the classification performance is affected by different parameters: the SAR orbit, the size of the training dataset, the use of different internal buffers on parcel polygons before signal extraction, the set of explanatory variables, and the period of the time series. In an operational context, this allows to choose the right balance between classification accuracy and model complexity. A key result is that using a training dataset containing only 3.2% of the total number of parcels allows to correctly classify 91.7% of the agricultural area. The impact of rain and snow is also discussed. Finally, this research analyses how the classification accuracy depends on some characteristics of the parcels like their shape or size. This allows to assess the relevance of the classification depending on those characteristics, as well as to identify a subset of parcels for which the global accuracy is higher.

AB We consider the rationale for the integration of remote sensing data and ground information using a statistical criterion to solve natural resources and environmental problems. The method is proposed to be implemented as the module of the "computer assistant". The algorithm that describes a set of the sequence of operations for automation of the decision-making procedure is presented. This algorithm should free the operator from a significant amount of subjective and labor-intensive work, which is performed using visual methods.
   Based on the proposed methodology, we perform the object recognition in aerospace images of the territory with different geological and landscape conditions and, respectively, with standard objects of different classes with different sets of values of informative features (of different nature and dimension). For the recognition and classification of images of studied objects, the probabilities of the ratios of informative features of the studied areas to ones of each standard object present in the aerospace image were determined.
   The results of testing the proposed methodology are presented on the examples of assessing oil and gas prospects in the areas of the Dnieper-Donetsk cavity and the problem of classifying crops of different varieties in different periods of vegetation in the agricultural fields in the Kyiv region.

AB Hyperspectral (HS) imaging has been used extensively in remote sensing applications like agriculture, forestry, geology and marine science. HS pixel classification is an important task to help identify different classes of materials within a scene, such as different types of crops on a farm. However, this task is significantly hindered by the fact that HS pixels typically form high-dimensional clusters of arbitrary sizes and shapes in the feature space spanned by all spectral channels. This is even more of a challenge when ground truth data is difficult to obtain and when there is no reliable prior information about these clusters (e.g., number, typical shape, intrinsic dimensionality). In this letter, we present a new graph-based clustering approach for hyperspectral data mining that does not require ground truth data nor parameter tuning. It is based on the minimax distance, a measure of similarity between vertices on a graph. Using the silhouette index, we demonstrate that the minimax distance is more suitable to identify clusters in raw hyperspectral data than two other graph-based similarity measures: mutual proximity and shared nearest neighbours. We then introduce the minimax bridgeness-based clustering approach, and we demonstrate that it can discover clusters of interest in hyperspectral data better than comparable approaches.

AB Leveraging the recent availability of accurate, frequent, and multimodal (radar and optical) Sentinel-1 and -2 acquisitions, this paper investigates the automation of land parcel identification system (LPE) crop type classification. Our approach allows for the automatic integration of temporal knowledge, i.e., crop rotations using existing parcel-based land cover databases and multi-modal Sentinel-1 and -2 time series. The temporal evolution of crop types was modeled with a linearchain conditional random field, trained with time series of multi-modal (radar and optical) satellite acquisitions and associated LPIS. Our model was tested on two study areas in France (>= 1250 km(2)) which show different crop types, various parcel sizes, and agricultural practices: .the Seine et Marne and the Alpes de Haute-Provence classified accordingly to a fine national 25-class nomenclature. We first trained a Random Forest classifier without temporal structure to achieve 89.0% overall accuracy in Seine et Marne (10 classes) and 73% in Alpes de Haute-Provence (14 classes). We then demonstrated experimentally that taking into account the temporal structure of crop rotation with our model resulted in an increase of 3% to +5% in accuracy. This increase was especially important (+12%) for classes which were poorly classified without using the temporal structure. A stark positive impact was also demonstrated on permanent crops, while it was fairly limited or even detrimental for annual crops.

AB The need for timely, accurate, and interoperable geospatial information is steadily increasing. In this context, process-based image processing systems will be the initial segment for future's automatic systems. A process-based system is believed to be a good approach for agricultural purpose because agricultural activities are carried out according to a periodic (annual) cycle. Therefore, a process-based image analysis procedure was designed for routine crop classification for an agricultural region in Kirklareli, Turkey. The process tree developed uses a multi-temporal image data set as an input and gives the final crop classification as an output by using an incremental rule set. The test data set was composed of five images of Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre 4 (SPOT 4) data acquired in 2007.
   Basically, image objects were first extracted and then classified. A rule set was structured depending on class definitions. A decision-based process was executed and formed a multilevel image classification system. The final classification was obtained by merging classes from the appropriate levels where they were extracted. To evaluate the success of the application the accuracy of the classification was assessed. The overall accuracy and kappa index of agreement was found to be 80% and 0.78, respectively.
   At the end of the study, problems of segmentation and classification operations were discussed and solution approaches were outlined. To assess the process in terms of its scope for automation, the efficiency and success of the rule set were also discussed. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical Northern Australia is a vast region dominated by extensive cattle grazing. Australia is seeking opportunities to intensify land use in this region through irrigation. We describe a digital soil mapping (DSM) approach for the Flinders and Gilbert catchments (combined area, 155,000 km(2)) in north Queensland to supply soil property (i.e. target variable) maps for an eventual crop-specific irrigation suitability assessment.
   We applied a statistically-based survey design to identify new soil sampling sites. This data was merged with legacy soil data to produce a combined dataset of 1951 soil sites used in our DSM approach to map 16 soil target variables. Our mapping relied on the RuleFit3 analytical toolset and environmental correlation employing 13 predictors from terrain analysis, mapping and remote sensing. We present prediction and evaluation for three categories of target variables, namely: numeric, binary and categorical using the examples of surface pH (H2O) (numeric), rocky/non-rocky (binary) and permeability (categorical).
   Prediction quality was evaluated using internal cross-validation, independent validation, and non-parametric bootstrapping. Under internal cross-validation the models achieved R-squared of 0.49 for surface pH (H2O) (numerical), 76% classification accuracy for rocky/non-rocky (binary) and 56% classification accuracy for soil permeability (categorical). Under independent validation the target variables achieved a R-squared of 0.67 for surface pH (H2O), and accuracy of 93% for rocky/non-rocky accuracy of 63% for soil permeability. Non-parametric bootstrapping conducted on the surface pH (H2O) estimation showed the most reliable predictions to be in the pH range of 6-7. Despite the practical pressures imposed on the project (i.e. short project duration, and study area remoteness, size and difficult access), our DSM approach delivered the soil data within required specifications for the crop-specific irrigation suitability assessment. The approach gives a working framework of other soil mapping exercises sharing similar practical (i.e. environmental, logistical, data) constraints.

AB Producing accurate crop maps during the current growing season is essential for effective agricultural monitoring. Substantial efforts have been made to study regional crop distribution from year to year, but less attention is paid to the dynamics of composition and spatial extent of crops within a season. Understanding how crops are distributed at the early developing stages allows for the timely adjustment of crop planting structure as well as agricultural decision making and management. To address this knowledge gap, this study presents an approach integrating object-based image analysis with random forest (RF) for mapping in-season crop types based on multi-temporal GaoFen satellite data with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. A multiresolution local variance strategy was used to create crop objects, and then object-based spectral/textural features and vegetation indices were extracted from those objects. The RF classifier was employed to identify different crop types at four crop growth seasons by integrating available features. The crop classification performance of different seasons was assessed by calculating F-score values. Results show that crop maps derived using seasonal features achieved an overall accuracy of more than 87%. Compared to the use of spectral features, a feature combination of in-season textures and multi-temporal spectral and vegetation indices performs best when classifying crop types. Spectral and temporal information is more important than texture features for crop mapping. However, texture can be essential information when there is insufficient spectral and temporal information (e.g., crop identification in the early spring). These results indicate that an object-based image analysis combined with random forest has considerable potential for in-season crop mapping using high spatial resolution imagery.

AB Vectorising Landsat TM image (127/56 path/row) was carried out in this study to quantify deforestation using integration of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) in Permanent Forest Reserve (PFR) of northern Kelantan, Malaysia (latitudes 04degrees 30' N to 06degrees 15' N and longitudes 101degrees 20' E to 102degrees 40' E). The PFR boundary map in 1989 was digitised to analyse physical factors that affect deforestation. By using minimum distance supervised classification, Landsat TM is an effective tool for distinguishing forested area from non-forested area such as rubber, oil palm and paddy with overall accuracy of about 84.8% and mean accuracy of between 58.3 and 97.7%. The rate of deforestation was about 2.3% per year with 73 236 ha of the PFR in the northern part of Kelantan being converted into non-forested purposes within eight years (1989-1997). The change from forest into mixed crop or rubber within eight years was estimated to be 19 252.1 ha. However, 53 984.1 ha of forest were converted into shrubs, while approximately 1178.5 ha of forest were converted into grassland/open areas. This study implies that RS/GIS technique is a useful tool in quantifying deforestation in PFR.

AB Fallowing is a common practice in Mediterranean areas where water scarcity becomes a limiting factor, affecting soil productivity, crop yield and biodiversity. In mainland Spain, fallow lands expand across three million hectares every year, constituting around 30% of rainfed arable lands and 6% of the national surface. There is a need of monitoring fallow lands to better map land use intensity and therefore achieve a sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture. However, most of current land use classification systems do not include lands under fallowing practices as a specific class. In this research, a new and highly operative methodology based on NDVI time series autocorrelation values to assess fallowing temporal patterns across rainfed agricultural areas is proposed. This approach was tested in mainland Spain, using the autocorrelation function of MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2012 at 250 m spatial resolution. The field observational database from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was used for validation purposes. The dataset used includes 338 pixels with annual information about the cultivated and fallowed surface within the entire study period. It was demonstrated that specific autocorrelation values at lags corresponding to one, two, and three years contained relevant information to identify lands under fallowing practices and assess their temporal pattern. Integrating autocorrelation variables in a random forest model made it possible to improve the assessment. The classification results were in agreement with the field dataset with an overall accuracy higher than 80%. Results revealed that approximately half of rainfed agricultural areas were regularly cultivated and distributed mainly in the northwestern Spain. The other half mainly located across northeast, center and south of Spain, showed crop-fallow rotation patterns. This methodology is a promising technique to map land management intensity using the entire time series in a highly operative manner. It is expected that in the near future the availability of remote sensing time series with better spatial resolution will make it possible to improve the assessment of agricultural intensification.

AB The past decades have seen an increasing demand for operational monitoring of crop conditions and food production at local to global scales. To properly use satellite Earth observation for such agricultural monitoring, high temporal revisit frequency over vast geographic areas is necessary. However, this often limits the spatial resolution that can be used. The challenge of discriminating pixels that correspond to a particular crop type, a prerequisite for crop specific agricultural monitoring, remains daunting when the signal encoded in pixels stems from several land uses (mixed pixels), e. g., over heterogeneous landscapes where individual fields are often smaller than individual pixels. The question of determining the optimal pixel sizes for an application such as crop identification is therefore naturally inclined towards finding the coarsest acceptable pixel sizes, so as to potentially benefit from what instruments with coarser pixels can offer. To answer this question, this study builds upon and extends a conceptual framework to quantitatively define pixel size requirements for crop identification via image classification. This tool can be modulated using different parameterizations to explore trade-offs between pixel size and pixel purity when addressing the question of crop identification. Results over contrasting landscapes in Central Asia demonstrate that the task of finding the optimum pixel size does not have a "one-size-fits-all" solution. The resulting values for pixel size and purity that are suitable for crop identification proved to be specific to a given landscape, and for each crop they differed across different landscapes. Over the same time series, different crops were not identifiable simultaneously in the season and these requirements further changed over the years, reflecting the different agro-ecological conditions the crops are growing in. Results indicate that sensors like MODIS (250 m) could be suitable for identifying major crop classes in the study sites, whilst sensors like Landsat (30 m) should be considered for object-based classification. The proposed framework is generic and can be applied to any agricultural landscape, thereby potentially serving to guide recommendations for designing dedicated EO missions that can satisfy the requirements in terms of pixel size to identify and discriminate crop types.

LA English
DT Article
ID COMMAND AREA
AB Water Utilisation Index (WUI) defined as, area irrigated per unit volume is a measure of water delivery performance and constitutes one of the important spatial performance indicators of an irrigation system. WUI also forms basis for evaluating the adequacy of seasonal irrigation supplies in an irrigation system (inverse of WUI is delta, i.e. depth of water supplied to a given irrigation unit). In the, present study WUI and adequacy indicators were used in benchmarking the performance of Nagarjunasagar Left Canal Command (NSLC) in Andhra Pradesh. Optimised temporal satellite data of rabi season during the years 1990-91 and 199899 was used in deriving irrigated crop areas adopting hierarchical classification approach. Paddy is the predominant crop grown and cotton, chillies, sugarcane etc. are the other crops grown in the study area. Equivalent wet area (paddy crop area) was estimated using the operationally used project specific conversion factors. WUI was estimated at disaggregated level viz., distributary, irrigation block, irrigation zone level using the canal discharge data. At project level, WUI estimated to be 65 ha/MCM and 92 ha/MCM during rabi season of 1990-91 and 1998-99 years respectively. A comparison of total irrigated area and discharges corresponding to both the years indicate that irrigation service is extensive and sub optimal during 1998-99 and it is intensive and optimal in 1990-91. It was also observed that WUI is lesser in blocks of with higher Culturable Command Area (CCA) compared to the blocks of lower CCA. All the disaggregated units were ranked into various groups of different levels of water distribution performance. The study demonstrates the utility of WUI as spatial performance indicator and thus useful for benchmarking studies of irrigation command areas. The WUI together with satellite data derived spatial irrigation intensity, crop productivity constitutes important benchmarking indices in irrigation command areas.

AB A general model for multisource classification of remotely sensed data based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) is proposed. A specific model for fusion of optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) ground cover data is presented in detail and tested, The MRF model exploits spatial class dependencies (spatial context) between neighboring pixels in an image, and temporal class dependencies between different images of the same scene, By including the temporal aspect of the data, the proposed model is suitable for detection of class changes between the acquisition dates of different images, The performance of the proposed model is investigated by fusing Landsat TM images, multitemporal ERS-1 SAR images, and GIS ground-cover maps for land-use classification, and on agricultural crop classification based on Landsat TM images, multipolarization SAR images, and GIS crop field border maps, The performance of the MRF model is compared to a simpler reference fusion model, On an average, the MRF model results in slightly higher (2%) classification accuracy when the same data is used as input to the two models, When GIS field border data is included in the MRF model, the classification accuracy of the MRF model improves by 8%, For change detection in agricultural areas, 75% of the actual class changes are detected by the MRF model, compared to 62% for the reference model, Based on the well-founded theoretical basis of Markov Random Field models for classification tasks and the encouraging experimental results in our small-scale study, we conclude that the proposed MRF model is useful for classification of multisource satellite imagery.

AB Since 1980, millions of people have been harmed by natural disasters that have cost society over three trillion dollars. After a natural disaster has occurred, the creation of maps that identify the damage to buildings and infrastructure is imperative. Currently, many organizations perform this task manually, using pre- and post-disaster images and well-trained humans to infer the degree and extent of damage. This manual task can take days to complete. We propose to do this task automatically using post-disaster satellite imagery. We use a pre-trained neural network, SegNet, and replace its last layer with our own damage classification scheme. The final layer of the network is re-trained using cropped segments of the satellite image of the disaster. Our test results show that it is possible to create these maps quickly and efficiently.

AB Land cover mapping of intensive cropping areas facilitates an enhanced regional response to biosecurity threats and to natural disasters such as drought and flooding. Such maps also provide information for natural resource planning and analysis of the temporal and spatial trends in crop distribution and gross production. In this work, 10 meter resolution land cover maps were generated over a 6200 km(2) area of the Riverina region in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, with a focus on locating the most important perennial crops in the region. The maps discriminated between 12 classes, including nine perennial crop classes. A satellite image time series (SITS) of freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery was used. A segmentation technique grouped spectrally similar adjacent pixels together, to enable object-based image analysis (OBIA). K-means unsupervised clustering was used to filter training points and classify some map areas, which improved supervised classification of the remaining areas. The support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel gave the best results among several algorithms trialled. The accuracies of maps generated using several combinations of the multispectral and radar bands were compared to assess the relative value of each combination. An object-based post classification refinement step was developed, enabling optimization of the tradeoff between producers' accuracy and users' accuracy. Accuracy was assessed against randomly sampled segments, and the final map achieved an overall count-based accuracy of 84.8% and area-weighted accuracy of 90.9%. Producers' accuracies for the perennial crop classes ranged from 78 to 100%, and users' accuracies ranged from 63 to 100%. This work develops methods to generate detailed and large-scale maps that accurately discriminate between many perennial crops and can be updated frequently.

AB Daily and annual evapotranspiration (ET) estimates were computed for three separate cities along the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Estimates were derived using two different methods: 1) a traditional crop coefficient method, and 2) a reflectance-based vegetation coefficient index in order to simulate both present and future urban water requirements.
   For the first method, an urban area land use and land cover classification was derived using a combination of video rasterized National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) data and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data sets. NAPP color infrared transparencies were video rasterized at 7.125-m ground resolution as RGB separates (visible green, red, and near infrared) and then combined with multi-date TM satellite imagery into a single data set. This multi-temporal and high spatial resolution data set was used as input to an unsupervised classification algorithm. The resulting classification map was converted into a geographic information system (GIS) in order to model 1993 annual evapotranspiration (ET) for the community of Greeley, Colorado.
   The second method used a linear correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and crop coefficients to relate a reflectance-based vegetation coefficient (V-c) to NDVI. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper imagery was transformed into three spatially distributed ET maps using the V-c and reference ET in a GIS environment. Irrigated areas subject to water conservation management were extracted from the ET maps using a GIS masking technique.
   As a result of this research, an urban land use crop coefficient curve was developed that may be useful for predicting seasonal and annual consumptive water requirements for a typical city in the semi-arid western United States. ET predictions were comparable using the vegetation coefficients and the crop use coefficient curve adds additional tools for predicting urban water consumption during drought conditions.

AB Spatial assessment of rice-cultivated areas is a crucial activity in Taiwan due to government initiatives to provide policymakers with reliable and timely information for devising successful rice grain import and export plans. The objective of this study is to develop a phenological object-based approach for collectively mapping patches of rice fields using the time-series Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We processed the data for 2019 cropping seasons, following three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct the smooth twelve-day time-series composite vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) polarized data, (2) object-based image classification of rice-cultivated areas using phenological metrics, and (3) accuracy assessment of the mapping results. The classification maps compared with the government's ground reference maps indicated satisfactory accuracies, with producer's accuracies of 84.2% and 82.6% and user's accuracies of 82.1% and 85.3% for the first and second crops, respectively. These results were reaffirmed by close agreement in area estimates between the satellite-derived rice area and government's reference data at township level, with coefficient of determination (R (2)) values of 0.96 and 0.94 for the first and second crops, respectively. In spite of some error sources, including mixed-pixel issues and edge effects, that lowered the mapping accuracy, the results of this study have demonstrated that our mapping approach using the time-series Sentinel-1 VH data and information of crop phenology could be potentially applied at a larger scale in Taiwan and transferable to other regions for updating rice crop maps on a timely and frequent basis.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of delivering a crop type map early during the growing season. Landsat 8 OLI multi-temporal data acquired in 2013 season were used to classify seven crop types in Northern Italy. The accuracy achieved with four supervised algorithms, fed with multi-temporal spectral indices (EVI, NDFI, RGRI), was assessed as a function of the crop map delivery time during the season. Overall accuracy (Kappa) exceeds 85% (0.83) starting from mid-July, five months before the end of the season, when maximum accuracy is reached (OA=92%, Kappa=0.91). Among crop types, rice is the most accurately classified, followed by forages, maize and arboriculture, while soybean or double crops can be confused with other classes.

AB This study proposes a new approach to determine sustainable agro-industry logistics by minimizing supply and demand imbalances using spatial analysis. The potato food crop agro-industry at Wonosobo district, Central Java, Indonesia, was selected as the case. This study first developed a spatial-based cropland sustainability classification. Second, developed a sustainable harvest prediction by modifying the multi-thresholding using remote sensing and IoT, namely SHT15 and rain gauge sensor. Third, we developed a spatial route planning wherein we adjust the COG and spatial Dijkstra algorithm to select the optimal route. This study developed a comprehensive sustainable analysis by integrating spatial dimensions with environmental, economic, and social dimensions to support sustainable food security. Multi-criteria spatial analysis was used in an environmental measurement considering altitude, soil texture, slope, rainfall, humidity, and temperature. In the economic dimension, we compare the predicted total harvests with the current production. We consider the social dimension, namely population density, spatial-temporal congestion, and risk hazard-zones index. This study shows that spatial-based cropland sustainability classification can determine the most sustainable location for potato plants. This study shows that the sustainable harvest prediction by the modified multi-thresholding can predict the harvests more accurately, namely 89.3%. Spatial distributing route planning with adjustment of the COG obtains more rational coordinates than the classical method. In addition, spatial Dijkstra algorithm modification can show a more optimal route for agro-industrial commodities. This new approach has demonstrated that spatial analysis can be an alternative solution to minimize supply and demand imbalances in sustainable agro-industry logistics.

AB Monitoring citrus diseases and pests in early stages is fundamental to ensure the efficiency of phytosanitary control and plant health. The various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and pests limit citrus production. Citrus gummosis disease, caused by the fungus Phytophthora spp., is the main fungal disease of citrus in Brazil. The lesions caused to the trunk and roots by Phytophthora spp. lead losses in production, foot and root rot, brown fruit rot, canopy discoloration and leaf yellowing. Remote sensing is a nondestructive detection technology, that has been used to detect phytosanitary problems in agricultural crops. Multi and hyperspectral sensors on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied in agriculture. In this study, the capability for the detection of citrus gummosis was evaluated in two data sets. The first one considered hyperspectral images acquired with a 25 band sensor covering a spectral range from 500 nm to 840 nm, and the second data set was a simulated 3 band of multispectral sensor. The results indicated a better performance for the detection of citrus gummosis with the hyperspectral images than with three bands multispectral images. The high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data and the detailed spectral information allowed a more accurate classification of citrus gummosis infected plants. The classification maps were validated with field data and achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (F-score = 0.55) for the health map produced with multispectral data and an accuracy of 0.94 (F-score = 0.85) for the health map produced by the hyperspectral data.

AB Precision crop management in modern agriculture requires timely and effective acquisition of crop growth information. Recently, unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have rapidly developed and are now widely used in crop remote sensing (RS). Vegetation index (VI) and color index (CI) are commonly used RS methods to monitor crops. Texture is intrinsic information of the images, which can reflect the crop canopy structure and be used for vegetation classification. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of combining VI, CI, and texture to improve the estimation accuracy of wheat growth parameters based on fixed-wing UAS imagery. Wheat field experiments were carried out at the Xinghua Experimental Station for two consecutive years of 2017-2019 on three wheat cultivars under five nitrogen fertilization rates. Two commonly used wheat growth parameters, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf dry matter (LDM), synchronized with wheat field UAS images, were obtained at key growth stages. Simple regression (SR) was used to determine quantitative relationships between RS variables (VI, CI, and texture) and LAI, LDM. The data showed that individual texture does not correlate well with wheat growth parameters, while a texture index (TI), containing two texture measurements, showed stronger correlation with LAI and LDM. With the utilization of simple regression (SR), VI (R2 21.87%) exhibited the best accuracy in estimating LAI and LDM, followed by TI (R2 26.28%) and CI (R2 0.34, RRMSE < 27.74%). Multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) were further employed to develop LAI and LDM estimation models using different input variable sets (VIs, VIs + CIs, and VIs + CIs + TIs). Compared with SR and MLR, the RF models that combined VIs, CIs, and TIs greatly improved the estimation accuracy of LAI and LDM, and the validated R2 of the best RF models for LAI and LDM estimation reached 0.78 and 0.78 (RRMSE = 17.32% and 13.83%) in pre-heading stages, 0.81 and 0.77 (RRMSE = 17.86% and 16.08%) in post-heading stages, and 0.76 and 0.75 (RRMSE = 18.13% and 16.79%) in all stages, respectively. This study demonstrated that image textures can assist wheat monitoring to achieve higher estimation accuracy of LAI and LDM, and fixed-wing UAS is a promising platform that can provide reliable data for large-scale crop management.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) and water content (WC) in the root zone are two major hydro-meteorological parameters that exhibit a dominant control on water, energy and carbon fluxes, and are therefore important for any regional eco-hydrological or climatological study. To investigate the potential for retrieving these parameter from hyperspectral remote sensing, we have investigated plant spectral reflectance (400-2,500 nm, ASD FieldSpec3) for two major agricultural crops (sugar beet and spring barley) in the mid-latitudes, treated under different water and nitrogen (N) conditions in a greenhouse experiment over the growing period of 2008. Along with the spectral response, we have measured soil water content and LAI for 15 intensive measurement campaigns spread over the growing season and could demonstrate a significant response of plant reflectance characteristics to variations in water content and nutrient conditions. Linear and non-linear dimensionality analysis suggests that the full band reflectance information is well represented by the set of 28 vegetation spectral indices (SI) and most of the variance is explained by three to a maximum of eight variables. Investigation of linear dependencies between LAI and soil WC and pre-selected SI's indicate that: (1) linear regression using single SI is not sufficient to describe plant/soil variables over the range of experimental conditions, however, some improvement can be seen knowing crop species beforehand; (2) the improvement is superior when applying multiple linear regression using three explanatory SI's approach. In addition to linear investigations, we applied the non-linear CART (Classification and Regression Trees) technique, which finally did not show the potential for any improvement in the retrieval process.

AB Irrigated soils in the Columbia Basin of eastern Washington are susceptible to wind erosion and nitrate leaching when left bare during the winter months. Producers are encouraged to incorporate cover crops into their rotations or leave crop residues on their fields over winter to minimize erosion. Actively growing vegetative cover is required to trap nitrate and prevent it from leaching. Although some growers have adopted these practices, it is difficult to estimate the total land area under cover during the winter months. Satellite radar imagery may be a tool for monitoring the adoption of the above-mentioned practices. Our objective is to determine the feasibility of discriminating among cover types using satellite radar imagery During the winter of 1999-2000, three RADARSAT-1 images of this area were obtained. Ground data was collected on or near each date of data acquisition. Three distinct groups were separated from one another through statistical analysis and unsupervised classifications: 1) smooth bare fields and,fields with sparse, dried residue, 2) smooth fields which contain sparse green vegetation, and 3) fields with heavy vegetation, either alive or dead, or rough bare fields. Variation in brightness within group I was correlated with soil moisture while the variation within group 2 was more a function of plant water in the canopy. Optical data may be required to aid in the identification of nitrogen scavenging crops, since actively growing vegetation is difficult to discern from fields with heavy residue or rough, bare surface conditions.

AB Spectral measurements are employed in many precision agriculture applications, due to their ability to monitor the vegetation's health state. Spectral vegetation indices are one of the main techniques currently used in remote sensing activities, since they are related to biophysical and biochemical crop variables. Moreover, they have been evaluated in some studies as potentially beneficial for detecting or differentiating crop diseases. Flavescence Doree (FD) is an infectious, incurable disease of the grapevine that can produce severe yield losses and, hence, compromise the stability of the vineyards. The aim of this study was to develop specific spectral disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of FD disease in grapevines. Spectral signatures of healthy and diseased grapevine leaves were measured with a non-imaging spectro-radiometer at two infection severity levels. The most discriminating wavelengths were selected by a genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection tool, the Spectral Disease Indices (SDIs) are designed by exhaustively testing all possible combinations of wavelengths chosen. The best weighted combination of a single wavelength and a normalized difference is chosen to create the index. The SDIs are tested for their ability to differentiate healthy from diseased vine leaves and they are compared to some common set of Spectral Vegetation Indices (SVIs). It was demonstrated that using vegetation indices was, in general, better than using complete spectral data and that SDIs specifically designed for FD performed better than traditional SVIs in most of cases. The precision of the classification is higher than 90%. This study demonstrates that SDIs have the potential to improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision agriculture applications.

DE RADARSAT-2; ORYZA2000; SCE-UA; Assimilation Strategy
AB Reliable information on rice planting areas and rice production is very important for rice planting countries to make state and economic policies. However, the areas where rice crop is cultivated are often cloudy and rainy, which entails the use of radar remote sensing data for rice monitoring. In this paper, two subjects were presented in order to assess the efficiency of newest SAR sensor RADARSAT-2 in rice mapping and yield estimation. In rice mapping, an optimal dual-polarization combination was obtained for single temporal rice mapping by ratio change detection. It shows that VH/HH is optimal for rice mapping at the early stage of rice growing, while both HH/VV and VH/VV are optimal for rice mapping at the middle period of rice growing. The optimal date and optimal classification polarization ratio HH/VV are used for the rice mapping and the accuracy can reach 84.9%. For rice yield estimation, an improved scheme has been put forward, which not only preserves an effective assimilation strategy, but also includes more rice parameters as important factors in the assimilation. To achieve this, rice crop model ORYZA2000 was coupled with an empirical rice backscattering model which expresses the dual-polarization ratios as a function of LAI, plant structures parameters and plant water content. LAI was a direct link between the two models, but plant structure parameters and plant water content was simulated through several empirical models expressed as function of DVS (Development Stage), which can be output from ORYZA2000. The results showed that the obtained yields over the sampling plots were generally overestimated by about 11.3%.

AB The study presents the analysis of the possible use of limited number of the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 to check if crop declarations that the EU farmers submit to receive subsidies are true. The declarations used in the research were randomly divided into two independent sets (training and test). Based on the training set, supervised classification of both single images and their combinations was performed using random forest algorithm in SNAP (ESA) and our own Python scripts. A comparative accuracy analysis was performed on the basis of two forms of confusion matrix (full confusion matrix commonly used in remote sensing and binary confusion matrix used in machine learning) and various accuracy metrics (overall accuracy, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, etc.). The highest overall accuracy (81%) was obtained in the simultaneous classification of multitemporal images (three Sentinel-2 and one Sentinel-1). An unexpectedly high accuracy (79%) was achieved in the classification of one Sentinel-2 image at the end of May 2018. Noteworthy is the fact that the accuracy of the random forest method trained on the entire training set is equal 80% while using the sampling method ca. 50%. Based on the analysis of various accuracy metrics, it can be concluded that the metrics used in machine learning, for example: specificity and accuracy, are always higher then the overall accuracy. These metrics should be used with caution, because unlike the overall accuracy, to calculate these metrics, not only true positives but also false positives are used as positive results, giving the impression of higher accuracy. Correct calculation of overall accuracy values is essential for comparative analyzes. Reporting the mean accuracy value for the classes as overall accuracy gives a false impression of high accuracy. In our case, the difference was 10-16% for the validation data, and 25-45% for the test data.

AB Parthenium hysterophorus (an alien weed) is posing serious threat to crop yields, livestock's and human health and is considered the seventh most devastating weed across the globe. Early identification and mapping of Parthenium hysterophorus is essential for the timely eradication and control of this alien invasive species. Hyperspectral remote sensing (due to its high spectral details) is highly valuable in discriminating vegetation species and mapping its distribution. However, the use of high-dimensional hyperspectral data possesses the threat of multicollinearity (i.e., contiguous wavelength-bands exhibits strong spectral correlation) which in-turn yields unstable parameter estimation. This study aims to explore the potential of hyperspectral (spectroscopic) data for discerning Parthenium hysterophorus and to identify optimal wavebands that are sensitive for species discrimination. In this study, the spectral signatures of Parthenium hysterophorus and four co-occurring plant species were acquired using portable hand held spectrometer. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) in conjunction with Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used discern the measured species based on their spectral profiles. The analysis yielded high classification accuracies for both the training (overall accuracy = 99%) and testing (overall accuracy = 97%) datasets. The SAM-GA picked a meaningful subset of spectral bands from different parts of electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., centering at 0.47 mu m, 0.715 mu m, 1.12-1.25 mu m and 1.8-1.9 mu m) which carries highest information for the spectral discrimination of Parthenium hysterophorus. In conclusion, this study confirms the capability of hyperspectral data in discerning Parthenium hysterophorus from other crops/plant species and also highlights the importance of few wavelength positions for the spectral discrimination of Parthenium hysterophorus weed.

AB In recent decades urban and peri-urban agriculture have gained attention worldwide as these are the store house of major cities for the availability of various resources like milk, fish, flower, etc. Urban or peri-urban farming contributes to food security and income generation for the people who resides around the major city areas. Often it faces various problems like encroachment of urban area, polluted water, lack of efficient workers, etc., especially in the developing countries. In this paper, multi-criteria decision analysis model and crop condition monitoring method have been applied to find out the suitable zones of peri-urban agriculture around Kolkata city. This model was tested on the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) using various criteria like land use, digital elevation model (DEM), water facility, road and market facility, etc. For analyzing the land use of KMA both supervised classification methods and to find out the agricultural area crop condition monitoring method (e.g., NDVI, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index) has been used by using remote sensing images. For the analysis of water facility, road and market facility in the various areas of KMA census data has been used. Multi-criteria decision analysis model revealed that northwest, central east, southeast, and northern zones of Kolkata Metropolitan Area is the most suitable zones for peri-urban agriculture. Finally, it can be said that this model is able to allocate the suitable land for the peri-urban agriculture very precisely. This model will help the urban, peri-urban planners, policy-makers, and decision-makers for taking action on various decisions at different levels.

AB The objectives of the study are flood hazard mapping and crops and settlement vulnerability assessment in a low laying riverine flood prone area of Bangladesh for different flood magnitudes. Flood hazard maps have been developed for different flood magnitudes integrating the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and interpolation of water level height of different water stations. Frequency analysis has been carried out to determine the water level of 2.33, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100-year return periods flood. Landuse or land cover map has been generated from the LANDSAT satellite images supervised classification. Vulnerability functions of risk elements and flood hazard maps are analyzed in GIS environment to develop vulnerability maps. Most of the settlement vulnerable areas were found in low laying lands from the settlement and crops vulnerability maps. This flood hazard vulnerability map can be used for selecting the type of crops and area for cultivation during the monsoon period on the basis of magnitudes of inundation of different flood zones.

AB In the present study, the differences in the kharif crop reflectance at varied wavelength regions and temporal SAR backscatter (at VV and VH polarizations) during different crop stages were analyzed to classify crop types in parts of Ranchi district, East India using random forest classifier. The spectral signature of crops was generated during various growth stages using temporal Sentinel-2 MSI (optical) satellite images. The temporal backscatter profile that depends on the geometric and di-electric properties of crops were studied using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The spectral profile exhibited distinctive reflectance at the NIR (0.842 mu m) and SWIR (1.610 mu m) wavelength regions for paddy (Oryza sativa; similar to 0.25 at NIR, similar to 0.27 at SWIR), maize (Zea mays; similar to 0.24 at NIR, similar to 0.29 at SWIR) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana, similar to 0.26 NIR, similar to 0.31 at SWIR) during pre-sowing season (mid-June). Similar variations in crop's reflectance at their different growth stages (vegetative to harvesting) were observed at various wavelength ranges. Further, the variations in the backscatter coefficient of different crops were observed at various growth stages depending upon the differences in sowing-harvesting periods, field conditions, geometry, and water presence in the crop field, etc. The Sentinel-1 SAR based study indicated difference in the backscatter of crops (i.e., similar to-18.5dB (VH) and similar to-10dB (VV) for paddy, similar to-14dB (VH) and similar to-7.5dB (VV) for maize, similar to-14.5dB and similar to-8dB (VV) for finger millet) during late-July (transplantation for paddy; early vegetative for maize and finger millet). These variations in the reflectance and backscatter values during various stages were used to deduce the best combination of the optical and SAR layers in order to classify each crop precisely. The GLCM texture analysis was performed on SAR for better classification of crop fields with higher accuracies. The SAR-MSI based kharif crop assessment (2017) indicated that the total cropped area under paddy, maize and finger millet was 24,544.55, 1468.28 and 632.48ha, respectively. The result was validated with ground observations, which indicated an overall accuracy of 83.87% and kappa coefficient of 0.78. The high temporal, spatial spectral agility of Sentinel satellite are highly suitable for kharif crop monitoring. The study signifies the role of combined SAR-MSI technology for accurate mapping and monitoring of kharif crops.

AB Because most land-cover types have distinct seasonal changes and corresponding reflectance characteristics in remotely sensed images, the signatures in time-series data are useful for discriminating different land covers. Although temporal signatures have been used to classify different land-cover types, they have not been fully exploited to classify specific crops, and the influence of low resolution should be evaluated. The aims of this study were to seek an effective method to classify specific crops using the temporal signatures in coarse time-series data and to examine the applicability of the data for crop classification as well. A winter wheat-producing region in China was selected for this case study. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day composite land surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1) data with a 250 m spatial resolution were used to calculate the vegetation index data, which was applied to detect the properties of live green plants. The noise in the time series was filtered to minimize the classification uncertainties. The curve shape in the time-series vegetation index profile was used as the major metric to classify winter wheat, and other phenological metrics extracted from the data were used conjunctly as auxiliary functions to improve the separability. The metrics for winter wheat classification were quantified in the large fields with relatively pure pixels. Winter wheat was successfully extracted from the MODIS vegetation index data, and the MODIS-derived result was validated with a fine-resolution (19.5 m) thematic map derived from images collected by the charge-coupled device sensor on board the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS). It showed that the MODIS-derived result had inevitable low-resolution bias, and the errors of commission and omission were 32.3 and 33.8%, respectively. The overall classification effect of the MODIS-derived result relied upon the distribution of pixel purity in the study area.

AB Monitoring of rice field, as a place for producing paddy is very important to realize one aspect of food security, namely food availability. Modern agriculture has been widely utilize remote sensing data, especially optical images for monitoring agricultural land in various aspects of land management. However, the use of optical images is hampered by cloud cover when monitoring rice fields because most of them located in tropical countries, so there is an alternative to using SAR imagery that has ability to penetrate clouds. One of the SAR image products is Sentinel-1A with band C on its sensors which was launched in 2014 and the data can be utilized by the wider community for free. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of multitemporal Sentinel-1A SAR imagery in identifying paddy and non-paddy in Bantul Regency's agriculture field which was measured through its mapping accuracy. Sentinel-1A multi-temporal images with ten recording dates from February to May 2018 were used as the main data for this study. The method used is a digital classification with two approaches i.e. parametric with MLC algorithm and non-parametric with k-NN algorithm. In addition, the Sentinel-1A, which consists of VV and VH polarization, performed in three classification schemes (VV multi-temporal, VH multi-temporal, and VV&VH multi-temporal). The classification results show that multi-temporal Sentinel-1A can be used to identify paddy and non-paddy crops with an accuracy of 77.69% (VV multi-temporal-MLC), 82.15% (VH multi-temporal-MLC), 88.45% (VV&VH multi-temporal-MLC), 76.64% (VV multi-temporal-kNN), 78.47% (VH multi-temporal-kNN) and 79.52% (VV&VH multi-temporal-kNN).

AB Rice is a primary staple food for the world population and there is a strong need to map its cultivation area and monitor its crop status on regional scales. This study was conducted in the Qixing Farm County of the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. First, the rice cultivation areas were identified by integrating the remote sensing (RS) classification maps from three dates and the Geographic Information System (GIS) data obtained from a local agency. Specifically, three FORMOSAT-2 (FS-2) images captured during the growing season in 2009 and a GIS topographic map were combined using a knowledge-based classification method. A highly accurate classification map (overall accuracy = 91.6%) was generated based on this Multi-Data-Approach (MDA). Secondly, measured agronomic variables that include biomass, leaf area index (LAI), plant nitrogen (N) concentration and plant N uptake were correlated with the date-specific FS-2 image spectra using stepwise multiple linear regression models. The best model validation results with a relative error (RE) of 8.9% were found in the biomass regression model at the phenological stage of heading. The best index of agreement (IA) value of 0.85 with an RE of 13.6% was found in the LAI model, also at the heading stage. For plant N uptake estimation, the most accurate model was again achieved at the heading stage with an RE of 11% and an IA value of 0.77; however, for plant N concentration estimation, the model performance was best at the booting stage. Finally, the regression models were applied to the identified rice areas to map the within-field variability of the four agronomic variables at different growth stages for the Qixing Farm County. The results provide detailed spatial information on the within-field variability on a regional scale, which is critical for effective field management in precision agriculture.

AB This study investigates a method using multi-temporal, multi-polarization ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data for mapping an agricultural area in a sub-tropical cloud-prone and rainy area of Pearl River Delta in south China. A total of six scenes of HH (radio waves transmitted and received in horizontal polarization) and VV (radio waves transmitted and received in vertical polarization) polarization ASAR data acquired from March to November 2006 were used for land cover classification. Meanwhile, four field surveys of 320 test sites were carried out simultaneously with ASAR image acquisition in May, July, September and November 2006. A decision tree classifier is used to classify seven main types of land cover features including sugarcane, banana fields, lotus ponds, fish ponds, mangrove wetland, seawater and buildings. As a result, a classification map of Nansha Island was generated with overall accuracy of 80% and a kappa coefficient of 77%. The results show that the multi-temporal and multi-polarization ASAR images can have good performance in separating the basic land cover categories in a sub-tropical cloud-prone and rainy area. The decision tree classifier is also approved to work efficiently on satellite SAR images with good classification accuracy. The analysis to get the best combination of radar scenes for the decision tree also proves that multi-temporal radar backscatter information received in the crop growth period is important in improving classification accuracy.

AB Monitoring the crop yield is one of the key factors to define agricultural land management strategies. Recent developments in spatial information technologies enabled cost and energy saving in crop yield prediction. The aim of this paper was to predict yield of the three major crops and yield loss under soil salinity effect which is one of the most important limitation in many Mediterranean countries. Crop yields were estimated using vegetation indices and Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) derived from Landsat (Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper) TM/ETM satellite images. Additionally, related crop pattern of the area was mapped using multi-temporal Landsat data set using object based classification. Soil salinity was mapped using radial basis function and field measurements with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) accuracy of 0.96 dSm(-1). The predictions were validated using real-time field measurements. Mean percent error (MPE) for wheat, corn and cotton were 7.9%, 8.8% and 6.3% respectively. Crop yield estimates were incorporated with various degrees of soil salinity. Soil salinity ranging between 8 and 10 dSm(-1) resulted yield loss of 55%, 28%, and 15% in corn, wheat and cotton respectively. The highest soil salinity resistance was observed only at cotton in 18 dSm(-1) with 55% yield loss. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, an increase has occurred in the use of new sensors such as digital measurement cameras or LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) devices in remote sensing studies. This situation has encouraged the development of new possibilities for data use. Currently, it is common to perform combined flights where digital cameras take images that record spectral information while LiDAR sensors produce point clouds with positional, spectral and echo information. The goal of this study was to assess the possibility of combining LiDAR intensity with the spectral information provided by digital cameras to increase crop classification accuracy. Due to the geometric characteristics of the LiDAR data collection process, LiDAR intensity was normalized before combining it with the spectral information from the camera. Two different geometric methods were used for this purpose. Both methods were based on the relative position of each point and the position of the sensor at the time of data recording. To analyze the effects of normalization, land-use samples with different radiometric behaviors were taken. The samples were used to assess the degree of variation in the intensity values of a same geographic area acquired in different flight strips by comparing the coefficient of variation of raw intensity data and normalized intensity data. Supervised classifications with the maximum likelihood algorithm were performed to assess the suitability of combining LiDAR intensity with digital images. These results were compared with those obtained using only information from the multispectral camera and showed an increase in accuracy of up to 40% in land-use discrimination after introducing normalized LiDAR intensity values. The combination of both data types allowed the classification of eight types of land use with an accuracy over 92%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Landsat TM spectral information to enhance the land cover of Scotland
   1988 dataset

ID UNITED-KINGDOM; REFLECTANCE; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION
AB The Scottish Office's Land Cover of Scotland 1988 Survey (LCS88), was announced in May 1987 and was intended to provide the first-ever detailed census of land cover in Scotland. It came about as a result of increasing concern about the nature and rate of land use change in rural Scotland and the need to obtain objective baseline information on which to build and evaluate future countryside policy. One of the recommendations of a Scottish Office feasibility study carried out prior to the LCS88 survey, was that satellite remotely-sensed data should be considered for measuring landscape change in the future. This paper relates specifically to this recommendation and presents the results of an evaluation study to investigate the use of limited acquisition satellite imagery from Landsat Thematic Mapper, to derive a land cover classification and spectral segmentation information to enhance the existing LCS88 dataset. Although a successful land cover, primary as well as some individual cover features, was obtained from the satellite data, the overall accuracy comparison with the LCS88 cover features was limited. However, the opportunistic mapping of important agricultural crops and primary cover types, such as oilseed rape and forestry cover features, or the interpretation of some of the considerable confusion between semi-natural grassland and improved grassland cover features, provided for an enhanced LCS88 dataset. This was also true for the illustration of the considerable potential of a satellite classification and spectral data, for identifying the component parts of LCS88 Mosaic cover features and estimating vegetation quality.

AB Groundwater has rapidly evolved as a primary source for irrigation in Indian agriculture. Over-exploitation of the groundwater substantially depletes the natural water table and has negative impacts on the water resource availability. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to identify the historical evolution of irrigated cropland for the post-monsoon (rabi) and summer cropping seasons in the Berambadi watershed (Area = 89 km(2)) of Kabini River basin, southern India. Approximately five-year interval irrigated area maps were generated using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat satellite images for the period from 1990 to 2016. The potential of Support Vector Machine (SVM) was assessed to discriminate irrigated and non-irrigated croplands. Three indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were derived from multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. Spatially distributed intensive ground observations were collected for training and validation of the SVM models. The irrigated and non-irrigated croplands were estimated with high classification accuracy (kappa coefficient greater than 0.9). At the watershed scale, this approach allowed highlighting the contrasted evolution of multiple-cropping (two successive crops in rabi and summer seasons that often imply dual irrigation) with a steady increase in the upstream and a recent decrease in the downstream of the watershed. Moreover, the multiple-cropping was found to be much more frequent in the valleys. These intensive practices were found to have significant impacts on the water resources, with a drastic decline in the water table level (more than 50 m). It also impacted the ecosystem: Groundwater level decline was more pronounced in the valleys and the rivers are no more fed by the base flow.

   anomaly; Web application; Northern Kerala
AB Application of geospatial technology is very shimmering in drought monitoring. Drpught severity in crops for six northern districts of Kerala has been attempted using Geospatial Techniques. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the major parameter used to measure vegetation health obtained from MODIS, Terra satellite products MOD13Q1, MODO2QKM. The mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Kerala state over 13 years was calculated. The daily anomalies of NDVI from its long term mean NDVI over the same period was determined based on which drought risk classification was done. High negative NDVI anomaly areas are susceptible to drought and the severity of drought risk on each crop can be identified using Land Use/Land Cover data. Overlaying daily NDVI Anomaly based drought risk map on land use/land cover map gives the drought risk for different crops. Based on this, a web application has been developed for Northern districts of Kerala state in India. This web application can be used to plan for drought management measures and can also serve as a database for drought analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reliable crop type maps from satellite data are an essential prerequisite for quantifying crop growth, health, and yields. However, such maps do not exist for most parts of Africa, where smallholder farming is the dominant system. Prevalent cloud cover, small farm sizes, and mixed cropping systems pose substantial challenges when creating crop type maps for sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we provide a mapping scheme based on freely available Sentinel-2A/B (S2) time series and very high-resolution SkySat data to map the main crops-maize and potato-and intercropping systems including these two crops on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria. We analyzed the spectral-temporal behavior of mixed crop classes to improve our understanding of inter-class spectral mixing. Building on the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE), we preprocessed S2 time series and derived spectral-temporal metrics from S2 spectral bands for the main temporal cropping windows. These STMs were used as input features in a hierarchical random forest classification. Our results provide the first wall-to-wall crop type map for this key agricultural region of Nigeria. Our cropland identification had an overall accuracy of 84%, while the crop type map achieved an average accuracy of 72% for the five relevant crop classes. Our crop type map shows distinctive regional variations in the distribution of crop types. Maize is the dominant crop, followed by mixed cropping systems, including maize-cereals and potato-maize cropping; potato was found to be the least prevalent class. Plot analyses based on a sample of 1166 fields revealed largely homogeneous mapping patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our classification system also for intercropped classes, which are temporally and spatially highly heterogeneous. Moreover, we found that small field sizes were dominant in all crop types, regardless of whether or not intercropping was used. Maize-legume and maize exhibited the largest plots, with an area of up to 3 ha and slightly more than 10 ha, respectively; potato was mainly cultivated on fields smaller than 0.5 ha and only a few plots were larger than 1 ha. Besides providing the first spatially explicit map of cropping practices in the core production area of the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, the study also offers guidance for the creation of crop type maps for smallholder-dominated systems with intercropping. Critical temporal windows for crop type differentiation will enable the creation of mapping approaches in support of future smart agricultural practices for aspects such as food security, early warning systems, policies, and extension services.

AB Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data forms the basis for numerous land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and analysis frameworks at regional scale. Compared to other satellite sensors, the spatial, temporal and spectral specifications of MODIS are considered as highly suitable for LULC classifications which support many different aspects of social, environmental and developmental research. The LULC mapping of this study was carried out in the context of the development of an evaluation approach for Zimbabwe's land reform program. Within the discourse about the success of this program, a lack of spatially explicit methods to produce objective data, such as on the extent of agricultural area, is apparent. We therefore assessed the suitability of moderate spatial and high temporal resolution imagery and phenological parameters to retrieve regional figures about the extent of cropland area in former freehold tenure in a series of 13 years from 2001-2013. Time-series data was processed with TIMESAT and was stratified according to agro-ecological potential zoning of Zimbabwe. Random Forest (RF) classifications were used to produce annual binary crop/non crop maps which were evaluated with high spatial resolution data from other satellite sensors. We assessed the cropland products in former freehold tenure in terms of classification accuracy, inter-annual comparability and heterogeneity. Although general LULC patterns were depicted in classification results and an overall accuracy of over 80% was achieved, user accuracies for rainfed agriculture were limited to below 65%. We conclude that phenological analysis has to be treated with caution when rainfed agriculture and grassland in semi-humid tropical regions have to be separated based on MODIS spectral data and phenological parameters. Because classification results significantly underestimate redistributed commercial farmland in Zimbabwe, we argue that the method cannot be used to produce spatial information on land-use which could be linked to tenure change. Hence capabilities of moderate resolution data are limited to assess Zimbabwe's land reform. To make use of the unquestionable potential of MODIS time-series analysis, we propose an analysis of plant productivity which allows to link annual growth and production of vegetation to ownership after Zimbabwe's land reform.

AB In Tunisia, Groundwater is an important water source for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses, but the deterioration of its quality, under the influence of anthropogenic activities and natural factors, limits its suitability for human consumption and irrigation. The present study was carried out to assess groundwater quality in Bouficha aquifer in north-eastern Tunisia using geochemical, geospatial and statistical techniques. The relationship between groundwater quality and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) patterns were also explored using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and Landsat satellite images. Groundwater samples were collected from sixteen wells in April 2015 and analyzed for their physical and chemical characteristics. Concentrations of major cations and anions in the groundwater vary spatially. The dominant water types in the investigation area are Na-Cl and Ca-SO4. A basic statistical study, applying hierarchical classification analysis confirms the existence of two groundwater types. To evaluate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation, chemical data were assessed using methods such as Electrical Conductivity, Kelley's ratio, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Magnesium Hazards, as well as Residual Sodium Carbonate. Regarding drinking groundwater assessment, the World Health Organization (WHO) standards were applied to define sites with drinking water permissible levels. Information was loaded in an ArcGIS software and analyzed with a Spatial Analyst extension using Inverse Spline interpolation methods. Fluoride content in most samples has values as high as 1.97 mg/L, with 53% of the samples showing fluoride concentration higher than the level suggested by the WHO for drinking water of 1.5 mg/L and ratified by the National Society of Exploitation and Drinking Potable Water of Tunisia. Additionally, reported nitrate concentrations are higher than the expected groundwater background level of 10 mg/L; indeed, values are up to 286 mg/L, being hazardous for domestic use and suggesting the presence of anthropogenic sources of water contamination. The Land Use and Land Cover (LULCC) of Bouficha aquifer were changed over seventeen years. The Landsat satellite images have shown that the built-up area increased from 2001 to 2018 to the detriment of water and crop vegetation. The overuse of fertilizers on a total agricultural area of Bouficha aquifer (60%) led to significant pollutants, including nitrate and a deterioration in its water quality. Regarding the WHO and the Tunisian drinking water guidelines, this work provides substantial evidence that groundwater quality is posing a significant health threat for residents. Similarly, results show groundwater's chemical content is also unsuitable for economic activities in the Bouficha region, mainly hazardous for irrigation purposes.

AB The application of satellite single-pass interferometric data to crop-type mapping is demonstrated for the first time in this work. A set of nine TanDEM-X dual-pol pairs of images acquired during its science phase, from June to August 2015, is exploited for this purpose. An agricultural site located in Sevilla (Spain), composed of fields of 13 different crop species, is employed for validation. Sets of input features formed by polarimetric and interferometric observables are tested for crop classification, including single-pass coherence and repeat-pass coherence formed by consecutive images. The backscattering coefficient at HH and VV channels and the correlation between channels form the set of polarimetric features employed as a reference set upon which the added value of interferometric coherence is evaluated. The inclusion of single-pass coherence as feature improves by 2% the overall accuracy (OA) with respect to the reference case, reaching 92%. More importantly, in single-pol configurations OA increases by 10% for the HH channel and by 8% for the VV channel, reaching 87% and 88%, respectively. Repeat-pass coherence also improves the classification performance, but with final scores slightly worse than with single-pass coherence. However, it improves the individual performance of the backscattering coefficient by 6-7%. Furthermore, in products evaluated at field level the dual-pol repeat-pass coherence features provide the same score as single-pass coherence features (overall accuracy above 94%). Consequently, the contribution of interferometry, both single-pass and repeat-pass, to crop-type mapping is proved.

AB In this paper, we provide an innovative contribution in the research domain dedicated to crop mapping by exploiting the of Sentinel-2 satellite images time series, with the specific aim to extract information on "where and when" crops are grown. The final goal is to set up a workflow able to reliably identify (classify) the different crops that are grown in a given area by exploiting an end-to-end (3+2)D convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. The method also has the ambition to provide information, at pixel level, regarding the period in which a given crop is cultivated during the season. To this end, we propose a solution called Class Activation Interval (CAI) which allows us to interpret, for each pixel, the reasoning made by CNN in the classification determining in which time interval, of the input time series, the class is likely to be present or not. Our experiments, using a public domain dataset, show that the approach is able to accurately detect crop classes with an overall accuracy of about 93% and that the network can detect discriminatory time intervals in which crop is cultivated. These results have twofold importance: (i) demonstrate the ability of the network to correctly interpret the investigated physical process (i.e., bare soil condition, plant growth, senescence and harvesting according to specific cultivated variety) and (ii) provide further information to the end-user (e.g., the presence of crops and its temporal dynamics).

ID ACCURACY
AB Natural and crop vegetation phenologic data become indispensable when creating thematically and geographically detailed maps through satellite images classification. Several date acquisition is necessary to achieve this cartography. However, the presence of clouds, shadows, snow, etc, is usual when many different dates are used and that fact implies an important loss in classifiable surface. This work presents a hybrid classifier designed to deal with the common problems appeared in the classification of Mediterranean vegetation. Specifically, IsoMM, the first phase of the hybrid methodology, is an unsupervised classifier that allows a better use of temporal series thanks to a particular treatment of NoData values (or missing values) in the images. This methodology has been applied to a Mediterranean forestry zone with a legend of eleven categories and has been compared to a Maximum Likelihood classifier. The presented improvements allow classifying more surface than a common NoData treatment strategy (wheter unsupervised, Maximum Likelihood classification or the extraction of a problematic date) and achieving high accuracy level.

AB This study explores the applicability of temporal and multi sensor data for specific crop mapping. For this, temporal data from a single sensor (LISS III from IRS-P6 satellite) was used and classified after selecting the best dates for mapping. In the second case a Landsat-5 TM image (other sensor/ multi sensor approach) is added to the selected best LISS III temporal dates combination and classified again for evaluating the effect of the addition of a another sensor data (i.e. Landsat-5 TM) on the overall accuracy of classification. A Possibilistic c-Means (PCM) classification technique has been used for extracting single class of interest (Sugarcane-ratoon) and for including the mixed pixels occurring in the heterogeneous landscape of the study area. In the absence of reference data, evaluation of the soft (fuzzy) classified outputs was done as an entropy measurement, where entropy provides an indirect absolute measurement of the classification accuracy in the form of an uncertainty measure.

DE Soil quality assessment; NDVI; Sentinel-2; crop heterogeneity; soil
   contrast
AB Abstract- Knowledge about the heterogeneity of the soil cover of arable land and its impact on crop yield is of great practical importance. One of the main indicators of heterogeneity of the soil cover of arable fields is their contrast. The existing methods of assessment of soil contrast are based on the analysis of soil properties, classification position, or belonging to a certain agroproductive group. We propose a new method for estimating soil contrast of arable lands, which is entirely based on the use of satellite data. We suggest using a pairwise comparison of NDVI values for the soil segments calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data for the last six years for all available scenes with the image of crops as the criterion of contrast. Based on the paired assessment of soil contrast and the length of boundaries between soils with different degrees of contrast, the contrast of the field as a whole can be estimated. Testing of the developed approaches on two test fields has shown their efficiency and the possibility in the future to create a system of automated remote technology for analyzing the contrast of the fields in order to gain prompt, low-cost, and independent assessments of their quality and develop recommendations on soil management.

AB Marginal land has received wide attention for its potential to produce bioenergy feedstocks while minimizing diversion of productive agricultural land from food crop production. However, there has been no consensus in the literature on how to define or identify land that is marginal for food crops and beneficial for bioenergy crops. Studies have used different definitions to quantify the amount of such land available; these have largely been based on assumed biophysical thresholds for soil quality and productivity that are unchanging over space and time. We discuss the limitations of these definitions and the rationale for considering economic returns and environmental outcomes in classifying land as marginal. We then propose the concept of "socially" marginal which is defined as land that is earning close to zero returns after accounting for the monetized costs of environmental externalities generated. We discuss a broad set of criteria for classifying land as socially marginal for food crops and suitable for bioenergy crops; with these criteria, this classification depends on spatially varying and time-varying factors, such as climate and market conditions and policy incentives. While there are challenges related to identifying this marginal land, satellite and other large-scale datasets increasingly enable such analysis at a fine spatial resolution. We also discuss reasons why landowners might choose not to convert bioenergy-suitable land to bioenergy crops, and thus the need for policy incentives to support conversion of land that is socially beneficial for bioenergy crop production.

AB This study investigates the robustness of an advanced classification algorithm to spatially map heterogeneous, fragmented croplands using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. Four parameters derived from Sentinel-1 (backscatters in dual-polarization: sigma(o)(VH), sigma(o)(VV), cross-ratio (sigma(o)(VH)/sigma(o)(VV)), and radar vegetation index (RVI)) were considered to develop temporal patterns and correlate with un-classified time-series satellite imagery using time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm. Pixel and parcel based classifications were considered to identify four crop varieties (paddy, sugarcane, cotton and vegetables) subjected to two water limiting conditions (low stress-LS, high stress-HS). In-situ data were split-sampled (30:70 ratio) between training (to develop temporal patterns) and testing (to validate classification output). Overall accuracy of pixel and parcel based classifications were 63% and 76% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.58 and 0.73 respectively. In conclusion, parcel based TWDTW algorithm conditioned by temporal signatures of RVI has effectively delineated croplands with varying irrigation treatments for yield and damage assessment modeling studies.

AB A new procedure is proposed for agricultural land-use mapping that addresses a known weakness of classical per-pixel methods in situations involving mixed tree crops. The proposed scheme uses a pair of very-high resolution satellite-borne panchromatic and multispectral images and integrates classification results of two parallel and independent analyses, respectively based on spectral and textural information. The multispectral image is divided into spectrally homogeneous but non-contiguous segments using unsupervised classification. In parallel, the panchromatic image is split into a grid of square blocks on which is performed a texture-driven supervised classification. Finally, the spectral and the textural classifications are fused to generate the land-use map. This method contrasts with object-based methods that sequentially perform image segmentation and classification. Results are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, based on field survey ground-truth data. The quantitative assessment is presented in terms of overall accuracy (from 80% to 100% depending on the area) and Kappa coefficients. Visual comparison of the resulting map with the ground-truth is performed, with the analysis of the binary error maps. Merging spectral and textural classifications results in finer border delimitation and improves the overall classification accuracy of agricultural land-use by 27% as compared to textural classification alone.

AB The ability to automatically monitor agricultural fields is an important capability in precision farming, enabling steps towards more sustainable agriculture. Precise, high-resolution monitoring is a key prerequisite for targeted intervention and the selective application of agro-chemicals. The main goal of this paper is developing a novel crop/weed segmentation and mapping framework that processes multispectral images obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a deep neural network (DNN). Most studies on crop/weed semantic segmentation only consider single images for processing and classification. Images taken by UAVs often cover only a few hundred square meters with either color only or color and near-infrared (NIR) channels. Although a map can be generated by processing single segmented images incrementally, this requires additional complex information fusion techniques which struggle to handle high fidelity maps due to their computational costs and problems in ensuring global consistency. Moreover, computing a single large and accurate vegetation map (e.g., crop/weed) using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties arising from: (1) limited ground sample distances (GSDs) in high-altitude datasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity images, and (3) multispectral image alignment. To address these issues, we adopt a stand sliding window approach that operates on only small portions of multispectral orthomosaic maps (tiles), which are channel-wise aligned and calibrated radiometrically across the entire map. We define the tile size to be the same as that of the DNN input to avoid resolution loss. Compared to our baseline model (i.e., SegNet with 3 channel RGB (red, green, and blue) inputs) yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of [background=0.607, crop=0.681, weed=0.576], our proposed model with 9 input channels achieves [0.839, 0.863, 0.782]. Additionally, we provide an extensive analysis of 20 trained models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in order to evaluate the effects of varying input channels and tunable network hyperparameters. Furthermore, we release a large sugar beet/weed aerial dataset with expertly guided annotations for further research in the fields of remote sensing, precision agriculture, and agricultural robotics.

TI Integration of multi-seasonal remotely-sensed images for improved
   landuse classification of a hilly watershed using geographical
   information systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERT SYSTEM
AB Information on existing landuse pattern and its spatial distribution is a pre-requisite for any watershed management programme. With the advent of remote sensing tools, with their inherent characteristics, it has been possible to prepare this dynamic resource map at various levels of confidence. But the application of multi-spectral classification techniques in vegetation discrimination has been the subject of discussion for many years.
   The paper describes a methodology developed to compile agricultural landuse map of a hilly watershed (where the rainfall erosivity is an ever-present threat) using geographical information systems (GIS). Multi-seasonal (monsoon-Kharif and post-monsoon-Rabi) and multi-sensor remotely-sensed data were used for mapping a landuse pattern of the watershed. The rasterised classified images, and the relevant watershed resources, were input and stored as separate layers in the GIS and then geometrically co-registered to a regular 30m grid. Knowledge-based rules were developed from the informed opinion of multi-disciplinary experts and field checkings, in addition to the knowledge of local landuse patterns. These expert rules were used to manipulate the information databases to discriminate various spectrally inseparable information classes, finding out the landuse/cover categories of the Kharif season under the cloud and its shadow areas. Finally, the improved and the agricultural landuse pattern map was classified into thick forest, sparse forest, degraded pastures, open (with/without scrub) areas, cropped (Kharif + Rabi) and fallow (Kharif + Rabi) lands. The areal extent of improved/final landuse map classes compared favourably with the natural conditions of the agro-climatic region of the watershed. The paper also envisages some future studies for watershed management policies.

AB When one considers the components involved in studying the worldwide supply and demand for agricultural products, the applications of remote sensing in general are many and varied. The scope of the physical, biological, and technological problems facing modern agriculture is an extremely broad one that is intimately related with worldwide problems of population, energy, environmental quality, climate and weather. The objective of this research was to determine maize acreage and to predict yield using SPOT images, weather data and field collected data for crop variables. The study area is located in the Corn Belt within the State of Sinaloa in northwestern Mexico. Sinaloa is the main producer of white maize in this country producing around 5 million tons per year. Yield prediction relies on determining extent acreage of the crop and on monitoring growth and developing using data on vegetation indexes (NDVI), on leaf area indexes (LAI) and on photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). For determining acreage and NDVI, multispectral and panchromatic scenes of SPOT-5 were processed using supervised classification techniques. NDVI data were obtained from the visible red and infrared bands. LAI and PAR data were gathered with canopy analyzers on 209 maize plots geo-located with GPS. Yield prediction was done with a mathematical model as a function of planting dates considering other relevant data such as crop genotype, crop vigor, phenological data of maize, climate and soil. The prediction yield was produced 40 days before harvest. Results indicate that, the total cultivated area of maize in State of Sinaloa, the agricultural cycle Fall-Winter 2011, was 383, 693 hectares, it predicted an average yield of 6.84 ton.ha(-1), with a confidence interval of 95 percent, a range of 6.58 to 7.9 ton.ha(-1) and an average output of 2.6 million tons of maize grain. In addition, we obtained an R-2 of 0.68 for the NDVI and LAI variables. The prediction yield model showed an effectiveness of 95%. This prediction of maize yields is already supporting decision makers from the Ministry of Agriculture and farmers as well.

AB NOAA AVHRR has been used extensively for monitoring vegetation condition and changes across the United States. Integration of crop growth models with MODIS imagery at 250 in resolution from the Terra Satellite potentially offers an opportunity for operational assessment of the crop condition and yield at both field and regional scales. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of the MODIS 250 in resolution data for retrieval of crop biophysical parameters that could be integrated in crop yield simulation models. A secondary objective was evaluating the potential use of MODIS 250 in resolution data for crop classification. A field study (24 fields) was conducted during the 2.000 crop season in McLean County, Illinois, in the U.S. Midwest to evaluate the applicability of the MODIS 8-day, 250 in resolution composite imagery (version 4) for operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy and leaf reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate a radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was used to simulate LAI. The seasonal trend of MODIS derived LAI was used to find crop model parameters by adjusting the LAI simulated from the climate-based crop yield model. Other intermediate products such as crop phenological events were adjusted from the LAI seasonal profile. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield simulations were conducted on a 1.6 x 1.6 km(2) spatial resolution grid and the results integrated to the county level. The results were within 10% of county yields reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The classification and segmentation of small region of interest from ground images is important in many domains: flood detection and evaluation, crop monitoring, environment monitoring, defense, etc. The paper uses a fusion scheme to classify small regions from remote images in four classes (different for satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle UAVs). As novelty, two neural networks, considered as primary classifiers, AlexNet and Perceptron (the last based on ten textural image features) are combined in a convolutional scheme to make up the global classifier. The weights from the convolutional layer are calculated according to the performances of the primary classifiers in a validation phase. Two datasets with different images are used for classifier learning, validation, and testing, one consisting in images from satellite and another consisting in images from UAVs. The global system performances were better than those of the individual neural network (system components) accuracies.

AB Accurate temporal land use mapping provides important and timely information for decision making for large-scale management of land and crop production. At present, temporal land cover and crop classifications within a study area have neglected the differences between subregions. In this paper, we propose a classification rule by integrating the terrain, time series characteristics, priority, and seasonality (TTPSR) with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Based on the time series of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Vegetation Index (NDVI), a dynamic decision tree for forests, cultivation, urban, and water was created in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for each subregion to extract cultivated land. Then, with or without this cultivated land mask data, the original classification results for each subregion were completed based on composite image acquisition with five vegetation indices using Random Forest. During the post-reclassification process, a 4-bit coding rule based on terrain, type, seasonal rhythm, and priority was generated by analyzing the characteristics of the original results. Finally, statistical results and temporal mapping were processed. The results showed that feature importance was dominated by B2, NDWI, RENDVI, B11, and B12 over winter, and B11, B12, NDBI, B2, and B8A over summer. Meanwhile, the cultivated land mask improved the overall accuracy for multicategories (seven to eight and nine to 13 during winter and summer, respectively) in each subregion, with average ranges in the overall accuracy for winter and summer of 0.857-0.935 and 0.873-0.963, respectively, and kappa coefficients of 0.803-0.902 and 0.835-0.950, respectively. The analysis of the above results and the comparison with resampling plots identified various sources of error for classification accuracy, including spectral differences, degree of field fragmentation, and planting complexity. The results demonstrated the capability of the TTPSR rule in temporal land use mapping, especially with regard to complex crops classification and automated post-processing, thereby providing a viable option for large-scale land use mapping.

AB The use of remote imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has tremendous potential for designing detailed site-specific weed control treatments in early post-emergence, which have not possible previously with conventional airborne or satellite images. A robust and entirely automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) procedure was developed on a series of UAV images using a six-band multispectral camera (visible and near-infrared range) with the ultimate objective of generating a weed map in an experimental maize field in Spain. The OBIA procedure combines several contextual, hierarchical and object-based features and consists of three consecutive phases: 1) classification of crop rows by application of a dynamic and auto-adaptive classification approach, 2) discrimination of crops and weeds on the basis of their relative positions with reference to the crop rows, and 3) generation of a weed infestation map in a grid structure. The estimation of weed coverage from the image analysis yielded satisfactory results. The relationship of estimated versus observed weed densities had a coefficient of determination of r(2)=0.89 and a root mean square error of 0.02. A map of three categories of weed coverage was produced with 86% of overall accuracy. In the experimental field, the area free of weeds was 23%, and the area with low weed coverage (<5% weeds) was 47%, which indicated a high potential for reducing herbicide application or other weed operations. The OBIA procedure computes multiple data and statistics derived from the classification outputs, which permits calculation of herbicide requirements and estimation of the overall cost of weed management operations in advance.

AB In wetlands, the land use/cover is under pressure of natural and human impacts and studies focus on changes of these areas are important. Turkey's wetlands are under threat due to gain land for agricultural production. Not only restrict the wildlife habitat, causes pollution due to usage of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers. Egirdir Lake area and its surrounding in particular has been an important settlement region in the northeast Mediterranean. After 1960's, the distinctive usage of the lake for agricultural irrigation increased the negative impact on it. The aim of this study is to examine the degree of the impact using Landsat satellite data dated 1987, 2002 and 2006, which are acquired and processed with remote sensing science and technology. Supervised classification was used in the research and land use/cover changes are presented. Class numbers and character names of the classes in the study area follow the CORINE methodology. According to the research results, the lake area decreased from 45,212 ha to 44,974 ha between 1987 to 2002 and then increased to 45,226 in 2006. With respect to specific cover types, the spread of Marshy and Reed Bed cover type expands from 1,345 ha to 2,903 ha between 1987 and 2002 and decreased to 2,625 ha in 2006. The Forest areas in the region decreased from 48,391 ha to 37,966 ha over the approximately 20 year study period. Furthermore scattered spread of Open Areas with Little or No Vegetation increased from 10,677 to 14,927 ha between 1987 to 2006. Perennial production patterns determined as Permanent Crops increased from 5,892 ha to 6,090 ha. Another land use class is annual agricultural production named as Arable Lands according to CORINE methodology, which expands from 4259 ha to 8585 ha. between 1987 to 2006. According to research findings, Urban Fabric land use class around Egirdir Lake is determined to increase 1,066 ha to 1,422 ha. According to research results, some land use around Egirdir Lake has been detected as not appropriate, especially Forest land types are decreased significantly and convert to agricultural lands and urban structures. An increase in Marshy and Reed Bed cover is detected in approximately 20 years.

AB Accurate cropland information is of paramount importance for crop monitoring. This study compares five existing cropland mapping methodologies over five contrasting Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) sites of medium to large average field size using the time series of 7-day 250m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mean composites (red and near-infrared channels). Different strategies were devised to assess the accuracy of the classification methods: confusion matrices and derived accuracy indicators with and without equalizing class proportions, assessing the pairwise difference error rates and accounting for the spatial resolution bias. The robustness of the accuracy with respect to a reduction of the quantity of calibration data available was also assessed by a bootstrap approach in which the amount of training data was systematically reduced. Methods reached overall accuracies ranging from 85% to 95%, which demonstrates the ability of 250m imagery to resolve fields down to 20ha. Despite significantly different error rates, the site effect was found to persistently dominate the method effect. This was confirmed even after removing the share of the classification due to the spatial resolution of the satellite data (from 10% to 30%). This underlines the effect of other agrosystems characteristics such as cloudiness, crop diversity, and calendar on the ability to perform accurately. All methods have potential for large area cropland mapping as they provided accurate results with 20% of the calibration data, e.g. 2% of the study area in Ukraine. To better address the global cropland diversity, results advocate movement towards a set of cropland classification methods that could be applied regionally according to their respective performance in specific landscapes.

AB Most agricultural systems in California's Central Valley are purposely flexible and intentionally designed to meet the demands of dynamic markets such as corn, tomatoes and cotton. As a result, crops change annually and semiannually, which makes estimating agricultural water use difficult, especially given the existing method by which agricultural land use is identified and mapped A minor portion of agricultural land is surveyed annually for land-use type, and every 5 to 8 years the entire valley is completely evaluated We explore the potential of satellite imagery to map agricultural land cover and estimate water usage in Merced County. We evaluated several data types and determined that images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) onboard NASA satellites were feasible for classifying land cover. A technique called "supervised maximum likelihood classification" was used to identify land-cover classes, with an overall accuracy of 75% achievable early in the growing season.

AB This paper develops a critical review of the hyperspectral splitting of the solar reflected radiation acquired by hyperspectral imaging sensors. The bandwidth used in the range from 2.0-2.5 mum by many hyperspectral sensors sometimes is too narrow for land cover classification. In fact, hyperspectral imagers often suffer from low signal-to-noise (SNR) in the shortwave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in noisy image collection. This paper presents a new methodological approach to the splitting of the solar reflected radiation, called the "superspectral approach." It is based on the principle of increasing the channel bandwidth by increasing the number of wavelengths, to build synthetic spectral bands with higher SNR. The methodology has been applied to the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) sensor, an airborne hyperspectral scanner used for environmental remote sensing applications in Italy. Interesting results have been achieved in crop classification, processing the Cordenons survey carried out in August 2001 in the northeastern part of Italy. The Spectral Angle Mapper algorithm was used for classification because it is insensitive to shadows. For accuracy assessment, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (k) were calculated and used in the comparison. Using the superspectral approach, an increment in the overall accuracy of about 42% and an increment in the kappa coefficient of about 51% were obtained in comparison to the classification accuracy of unprocessed original MINIS data (OA = 41.21, k = 0.35). A second case study is presented using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's experimental hyperspectral imager HYPERION. Data acquired over the lake of Garda (Italy) in October 2002 was processed with the superspectral approach. Comparing the simulated HYPERION superspectral bands with the original data, SNR improvements are achieved in the shortwave infrared region (from 0.7-54.2 for 2.012-mum wavelength and from 0.7-64.5 for the 2.365-mum wavelength). The methodology proposed is sensor independent and can be applied to any of the hyperspectral sensors currently available.

AB Paddy rice is one of the main grain crops in China. Accurate evaluation of rice planted area and spatial distribution are significant for the estimation of grain output and cropland allocation. Meanwhile, paddy rice is a main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and therefore its cultivation and spatial distribution have significant implications for rising temperatures and global climate change. In southeast China, even though paddy rice is widely cultivated, the paddy rice field is highly fragmented by other land use/cover. The difficulty in mapping small and fragmented rice fields is further exacerbated by the cloudy weather conditions in this area at periods corresponding to the rice growing season which impedes the utility of optical images. As optical data possess important spectral information which cannot be provided by satellite sensors (radar) least affected by weather conditions, much attention should be paid to the optimal use of optical data. GF-1 is an optical satellite launched in China on April 26, 2013 and has been providing remotely-sensed images with multispectral data of relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Despite its better resolution and freely available 16 m products, the application of GF-1 images in agricultural land-cover studies, especially in paddy rice mapping, is not as popular as other optical products such as Landsat, MODIS, SPOT and so on. In this study, we have employed multi-temporal images of GF-1 covering the 2016 rice growing season to map paddy rice cultivated fields in Tongxiang County, Zhejiang Province, China. The radiometric and geometric corrections were first carried out for multiple temporal GF-1 images. These corrected images were layer stacked to enable time series analysis. Since the two-band enhanced vegetation (EVI2) is changing with paddy rice growth stages, we extracted and smoothed the EVI2 temporal series from GF-1 images using the Savitzky-Golay filter (S_G filter) approach to further reduce the influence of atmospheric effects from clouds and water vapor. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm was then introduced on the temporal and filtered GF-1 images to map paddy rice fields in the area investigated. Classification results show two major types of rice crop planting patterns in Tongxiang County: single-cropped rice fields and paddy rice-upland crop rotation fields. The former cropping pattern is more uniformly distributed in Tongxiang County, whereas the latter mainly occupies the western and northern parts of the County. From the error matrix, overall classification accuracy, user's accuracy and producer's accuracy are the approximately 87.68%, 88.8% and 90.3%, respectively. These results indicate the promising potential of GF-1 temporal images in extracting paddy rice cultivated areas with higher accuracy in irregular and highly fragmented paddy rice cultivated areas.

AB A four-year study was conducted from 2000 to 2004 at eight field sites in Montana, North Dakota and western Minnesota. Five of these sites were in North Dakota, two were in Montana and one was in Minnesota. The sites were diverse in their cropping systems. The objectives of the study were to (1) evaluate data from aerial photographs, satellite images, topographic maps, soil electrical conductivity (ECa) sensors and several years of yield to delineate field zones to represent residual soil nitrate and (2) determine whether the use of data from several such sources or from a single source is better to delineate nitrogen management zones by a weighted method of classification. Despite differences in climate and cropping, there were similarities in the effectiveness of delineation tools for developing meaningful residual soil nitrate zones. Topographic information was usually weighted the most because it produced zones that were more correlated to actual soil residual nitrate than any other source of data at all locations. The soil ECa sensor created better correlated zones at Minot, Williston and Oakes than at most eastern sites. Yield data for an individual year were sometimes useful, but a yield frequency map that combined several years of standardized yield data was more useful. Satellite imagery was better than aerial photographs at most locations. Topography, satellite imagery, yield frequency maps and soil ECa are useful data for delineating nutrient management zones across the region. Use of two or more sources of data resulted in zones with a stronger correlation with soil nitrate.

AB Agricultural water management is a vital component of realizing the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals because of water shortages worldwide leading to a severe threat to ecological environments and global food security. As an agro-intensified irrigation area, the North China Plain (NCP) is the most important grain basket in China, which produces 30%-40% of the maize and 60%-80% of the wheat for China. However, this area has already been one of the largest groundwater funnels in the world due to long-term over-exploitation of groundwater. Due to the low precipitation during the growing period, winter wheat requires a large amount of groundwater to be pumped for irrigation, which consumes 70% of the groundwater irrigation. To alleviate the overexploitation of groundwater, the Chinese government implemented the Winter Wheat Fallow Policy (WWFP) in 2014. The evaluation and summarization of the WWFP will be beneficial for improving the groundwater overexploitation areas under high-intensity irrigation over all the world. So far, there have been few attempts at estimating the effectiveness of this policy. To fill this gap, we assessed the planting area of field crops and calculated the evapotranspiration of crops based on remote-sensed and meteorological data in the key area-Hengshui. We compared the agricultural water consumption before and after the implementation of this policy, and we analyzed the relationship between changes in crop planting structure and groundwater variations based on geographically weighted regression. Our results showed the overall classification accuracies for 2013 and 2015 were 85.56% and 82.22%, respectively. The planting area of winter wheat, as the most reduced crop, decreased from 35.71% (314,053 ha) in 2013 to 32.98% (289,986 ha) in 2015. The actual reduction in area of winter wheat reached 84% of the target (26 thousand ha) of the WWFP. The water consumption of major crops decreased from 2.98 billion m(3) of water in 2013 to 2.83 billion m(3) in 2015, a total reduction of 146 million m(3), and 88.43% of reduced target of the WWFP (166 million m(3)). The planting changes of winter wheat did not directly affect the change of shallow groundwater level, but ET was positively related to shallow groundwater level and precipitation was negatively related to shallow groundwater levels. This study can provide a basis for the WWFP's improvement and the development of sustainable agriculture in high-intensity irrigation areas.

AB A novel approach is presented to assess the agriculture performance in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh using long-term fortnightly satellite, meteorological and irrigation data-sets. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for the period 1982-2000 were used to study the pattern of anomalies in the NDVI anomalies and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in the agriculture areas to capture the drought events. After hierarchical image classification and field observations, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI product was used to generate the cropped area. The deviation of the NDVI (NDVIDev) was used to understand the agricultural growth/stress, variations in the cropped area and per cent fluctuation in space and time. The SPI, derived from the rainfall data pertaining to 2000-2015, was used to determine the distribution of precipitation. The crop area (%) and growth conditions during the different cropping seasons agree well with the prevailing drought conditions. A significant (p < 0.05) relation was found between the NDVI and precipitation in the summer monsoon each year except during excellent summer monsoon year. The seasonal precipitation, residual soil moisture and source of irrigation were also found to have significant (p < 0.05) impacts on the winter and summer crops.

AB A cropping system is defined as the cropping pattern and its management to derive benefits from a given resource base under a specific environmental condition. Crop rotation is a time-honored process of planting annual crops. The paper describes methodology and results of cropping system analysis for Panipat district of Haryana, climatologically characterized by hot summer, cold winter and dry air except during rainy season. Multi-date and Multi-season IRS LISS-III digital satellite data of 2007-2008 was geo-referenced with the already geo-referenced master image by collecting GCP's using second polynomial order and Nearest Neighborhood (NN) resampling approach. District boundary was overplayed on the image and all the data elements (pixels) within this were extracted for further analysis. Multi-layer stacks were prepared for Kharif, Rabi and Summer seasons using multi-date images of each season. The stacked images of different seasons were classified using complete enumeration approach and unsupervised ISO-Data clustering classifier based on some defined conditions such as number of clusters, threshold, standard deviation etc. To improve the accuracy Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of each date and non-agricultural mask was generated and used during the classification. The Kharif, Rabi and Summer cropping pattern maps and statistics were generated using classified images and applying logical combinations. During Kharif season rice is the major crop which occupies 73,700 ha area and in the Rabi season wheat is major crop occupying 82,900 ha area. In the summer season most of the area is lying vacant as fallow and major crops are fodder, vegetables etc. Sugarcane is an annual crop and it is available in all three cropping seasons. Rice-Wheat-Other, and Rice-Wheat-Fallow and the major crop rotations identified in the district.

ID REGION; INDEX
AB Environmental management of an area describes a policy for its systematic and sustainable environmental protection. In the present study, regional environmental vulnerability assessment in Hirakud command area of Odisha, India is envisaged based on Grey Analytic Hierarchy Process method (Grey-AHP) using integrated remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Grey-AHP combines the advantages of classical analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and grey clustering method for accurate estimation of weight coefficients. It is a new method for environmental vulnerability assessment. Environmental vulnerability index (EVI) uses natural, environmental and human impact related factors, e.g., soil, geology, elevation, slope, rainfall, temperature, wind speed, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, crop intensity, agricultural DRASTIC value, population density and road density. EVI map has been classified into four environmental vulnerability zones (EVZs) namely: ' low ', ' moderate ' ' high ', and ' extreme ' encompassing 17.87%, 44.44%, 27.81% and 9.88% of the study area, respectively. EVI map indicates that the northern part of the study area is more vulnerable from an environmental point of view. EVI map shows close correlation with elevation. Effectiveness of the zone classification is evaluated by using grey clustering method. General effectiveness is in between '' better '' and '' common classes ''. This analysis demonstrates the potential applicability of the methodology. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The massive use of pesticides in the production of food and raw materials generates growing world concern due to the numerous evidences of their negative effects on health and the environment. In countries where detailed information of agricultural pesticide use near to urban areas is not available, it is necessary have a simple methodology that does not require data that are difficult to obtain in order to create an ecological indicator of the risk of pesticide contamination at the peri-urban level. The objective of this research is to generate a peri-urban pesticide contamination risk index using satellite information and accessible scientific pesticide data. The Peri-urban Pesticide Contamination Risk Index (PUPCRI) is composed of an indicator of the toxicity of the set of pesticides used in each crop, and two factors that quantify the surface occupied by agricultural activity and the tree surface in the urban periphery. The Environmental Risk Index has been used to calculate the toxicity of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides used in soybean, corn and wheat crops. Through the classification of Sentinel 2 satellite images, data was obtained of arable land, soybean, corn and wheat crops, and tree cover, in different peri-urban rings, with a maximum distance of two kilometers from the urban edge. The PUPCRI index was tested in 20 cities pertaining to the region with the highest agricultural productivity in Argentina. The results show that most of the cities have high to very high indices of exposure to pesticides, mainly due to the proximity of agricultural activity to the urban edge and the lack of tree cover. The PUPCRI index allows a quick and simple analysis of the potential risk of exposure to the use of crop pesticides in the urban periphery.

AB University of California (UC) researchers have been involved in research and extension pertaining to measuring evapotranspiration (ET) rates and determining the minimum irrigation requirements of landscape plants for more than 30 years. Early work included the design and implementation of the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather station network and determining crop coefficients for warm and cool season turfgrasses based on historical ET and CIMIS data. Other researchers determined the minimum irrigation requirements for several species of established landscape trees, shrubs, and groundcovers in diverse climate zones throughout the state. In addition, the Water Use Classification of Landscape Species (WUCOLS) system was developed by UC personnel in the early 1990s which, to date, has classified more than 3500 landscape species into very low, low, moderate, and high water-use categories based on observation and personal experience by industry experts and UC personnel. Future work in the area of landscape water use and conservation will include updating WUCOLS as more data from replicated trials become available. New research at UC Riverside aims to improve irrigation efficiency (IE) through precision irrigation using smart controllers, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis under controlled conditions. Irrigation training and certification for public and private landscape managers must remain a priority because, even with advanced smart controller technologies, water savings will not occur with poorly designed and functioning irrigation systems.

AB [ 1] Land surface temperature (LST) can be derived from thermal infrared remote sensing data provided that atmospheric and emissivity effects are corrected for. In this paper, two correction methods were evaluated using a database of ground LST measurements and concurrent Envisat/Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data. They were the split-window ( SW) method, which uses two channels at 11 and 12 mm, and the dual-angle (DA) method, using one single channel ( 11 mm) at two observation angles ( close to nadir and around 55 degrees forward). The ground LST measurements were performed in a large, flat, and thermally homogeneous area of rice fields during the summers of 2002 - 2005, when the crop showed full vegetation cover. A total of 23 concurrences of ground measurements and AATSR data were obtained. Results showed that the SW algorithms worked satisfactorily provided that the characteristics of the area are correctly prescribed, either through the classification of the land cover type and vegetation cover fraction or with the surface emissivity. In this case the AATSR-derived LSTs agreed with the ground LSTs within +/- 1.0 degrees C for all the data of the comparison, with negligible average bias and a standard deviation of 0.5 degrees C. The DA algorithms were less accurate than the SW algorithms for the data used in this study, yielding standard deviations of 1.0 degrees C.

AB This research aims to develop a decision support system based on the conservation of biotopes within a Mediterranean agricultural landscape through the optimization of agricultural productivity. The first stage of this research includes mapping crop patterns using medium-resolution satellite sensor data recorded by LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 over Lower Seyhan Plain (LSP) located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey between 2010 and 2016. In the second stage, crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat, corn, and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the CropSyst model. Additionally, the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related N load. In the last stage, conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels. The model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat, cotton, first crop corn, and second crop corn 21%, 28%, 47%, and 4% of total production in LSP, respectively. The average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161,548 tons and equal to 16,5% of the total plain area. The largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation; the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation. The largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second-crop corn, whereas, the smallest amount from wheat. It can be concluded that nitrogen fertilizer should be applied according to the soil characteristics, reduced by 5% for wheat, 10% for first crop corn, and 50% for second crop corn. As a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and N load to the wetlands will decrease.

AB In the study, the importance of pedogeomorphic analysis in land resource inventories at various scales, mutual contributions of pedology and geomorphology, classification of geoforms, application of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) in geomorphology mapping were discussed. This article describes how pedogeomorphic analysis was used in detailed soil surveys in basaltic uplands of Darwha plateau in Yavatmal district, Maharashtra, in developing soil-landscape models that control and explain the shrink-swell soil pattern within a land region having similar agricultural management requirements for cotton-based cropping systems. Soil-landscape relationships in Darwha plateau were studied in detailed along the transects comprised of lithic/typic Ustorthents on plateau tops to lithic/typic/ vertic Haplustepts on pediments and leptic to Typic Haplusterts on pediplains. The key pedogenic processes recognized in shrink-swells were identified as development of vertic features and CaCO3 accumulation in deeper layers. Both field and laboratory analyses confirmed that the soils within landscapes form a continuum but that recognition of the soil groupings was more practical and feasible in mapping soils in the region. A combination of IRS-P6 and Cartosat-I fused data, field examination of soils and their characterization was used to recognize landscape-related soil groupings to develop farm scale maps that can support multiple land use applications and decision-making.

AB Agricultural crop abandonment negatively impacts local economy and environment since land, as a resource for agriculture, is not optimally utilized. To take necessary actions to rehabilitate abandoned agricultural lands, the identification of the spatial distribution of these lands must be acknowledged. While optical images had previously illustrated potentials in the identification of agricultural land abandonment, tropical areas often suffer cloud coverage problem that limits the availability of the imageries. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the potential of ALOS-1 and 2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 and 2) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images for the identification and classification of abandoned agricultural crop areas, namely paddy, rubber and oil palm fields. Distinct crop phenology for paddy and rubber was identified from ALOS-1 PALSAR; nonetheless, oil palm did not demonstrate any useful phenology for discriminating between the abandoned classes. The accuracy obtained for these abandoned lands of paddy, rubber and oil palm was 93.33%+/- 0.06%, 78%+/- 2.32% and 63.33%+/- 1.88%, respectively. This study confirmed that the understanding of crop phenology in relation to image date selection is essential to obtain high accuracy for classifying abandoned and non-abandoned agricultural crops. The finding also portrayed that PALSAR offers a huge advantage for application of vegetation in tropical areas.

AB Vegetation classification is a fundamental task in several applications such as forest management, remote sensing-based crop monitoring, and mitigation of plant diseases, digital prototyping of plants, and plant phenotyping, among others. We propose a novel supervoxel-based methodology to accurately detect vegetation from small-footprint full-waveform airborne laser scanning data in urban and mountainous scenes. Mathematically, the full-waveform decomposition and fitting model based on multiple kernels is presented to generate high-density 3D point clouds and their relevant attributes. The homogeneous supervoxels are then generated by using an enhanced probability density clustering (PDC) algorithm. For each supervoxel, we employ latent Dirichlet allocation to obtain supervoxels features through generalisation of geometric and full-waveform features of point clouds. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ensemble classifier random forest (RF) are used to classify these supervoxels into vegetation and non-vegetation. Our experiments on urban and mountainous scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves an overall accuracy of 98.27% and 96.47% respectively by RF classifier and achieves an overall accuracy of 98.16% and 97.67% on the same data sets by SVM classifier. By integrating full-waveform information and more meaningful generalised features, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods at preserving a trade-off between missing alarm rate and false alarm rate.

ID PATTERN
AB Trans-Himalayan mountains, owing to harsh climatic conditions and a short growing season support low vegetation cover (< 20%), yet it is known to harbour a unique assemblage of flora and fauna which have not been systematically inventoried and documented so far. This paper deals with spatial and non-spatial information on landscape units, vegetation characteristics and plant species diversity of Nubra Valley in Ladakh, India. Based on digital - visual (on screen) interpretation of remote sensing data coupled with knowledge-based classification we delineated 19 cover classes (11 vegetation types and 8 non-vegetation categories). The vascular plants (angiosperms and gymnosperms) were systematically collected using stratified random sampling of different landscape/vegetation to characterize plant communities and assess the distribution patterns of species. The study reveals that nearly 78-80% of plant species in Nubra are restricted to the valley bottoms. In all, 414 species of vascular plants were recorded from the study area. These belongs to 56 families and 202 genera. Of these, 102 species were reported to be used in traditional system of medicine by Amchis over 80 species are largely associated with cultivated fields and human habitation. As many as 49 species were cultivated which include several varieties of crop plants especially those of barley and buckwheat. Aspects of bioprospecting and conservation of valuable species have been discussed.

AB The primary cause of soil degradation is soil erosion because it contributes to the loss of organic matter and nutrients, which are important for plant growth. Soil loss quantification is an important factor for practitioners and policy makers for soil and water conservation. The Revised Universal Soil-Loss Equation (RUSLE) model with remote-sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), an integrated technique was used in current research to determine soil loss in Udham Singh Nagar District of Uttarakhand (India). The overlay of soil erodibility factor (K), rainfall runoff erosivity factor(R), Crop management factor (C), slope length and slope Steepness Factor (LS) and Conservation practices factor (P) were carried out using GIS software. The different parameters such as rainfall, Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC), slope, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), contours, drainage-network, soil texture, and organic matter were integrated to prepare a database for RUSLE equation by employing ENVI and QGIS software. The result of LU/LC classification shows that maximum area was occupied by agriculture land (38.66%), followed by fallow land (33.42), forest (17.57%), built-up area (5.71%), river (2.46%) and water bodies (2.18%). The outcome indicates that annual soil loss in the studied region ranged from 0-40 ton/ha/year. It is found that soil erosion has a significant effect on both western and eastern parts of the study region.

AB Mapping of sugarcane planted area is an important information for decision making, mainly when the search for alternatives to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions has indicated the use of biofuels as a viable option. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology in order to automate the sugarcane mapping task when remote sensing data are used. Thus the integration of two major approaches of Artificial Intelligence, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM), were tested in a study area located in Sao Paulo state, which is well representative of the agriculture of large regions of Brazil and other countries. OBIA was used to emulate the interpreter knowledge in the process of sugarcane mapping, and DM techniques were employed for automatic generation of knowledge model. A time series of four Landsat images was acquired in order to represent the wide variability of the patterns during sugarcane crop season. Definiens Developer (R) multiresolution segmentation algorithm produced the objects and properly trained decision tree applied to the Landsat data for the generation of the thematic map with sugarcane as the main class of interest. An overall accuracy of 94% (Kappa = 0,87) was obtained, showing that OBIA and DM are very efficient and promising in the direction of automating the sugarcane classification process with Landsat multitemporal time series.

AB Prompt monitoring of maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) is critical for the prevention and control of disease and to ensure high crop yield and quality. Here, we first analyzed the spectral differences between MDMV-infected red leaves and healthy leaves and constructed a sensitive index (SI) for measurements. Next, based on the characteristic bands (R-lambda) associated with leaf anthocyanins (Anth), we determined vegetation indices (VIs) commonly used in plant physiological and biochemical parameter inversion and established a vegetation index (VIc) by utilizing the combination of two arbitrary bands following the construction principles of NDVI, DVI, RVI, and SAVI. Furthermore, we developed classification models based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) in order to distinguish the red leaves from healthy leaves. Finally, we performed UR, MLR, PLSR, PCR, and SVM simulations on Anth based on R-lambda, VIs, VIc, and R-lambda + VIs + VIc and indirectly estimated the severity of MDMV infection based on the relationship between the reflection spectra and Anth. Distinct from those of the normal leaves, the spectra of red leaves showed strong reflectance characteristics at 640 nm, and SI increased with increasing Anth. Moreover, the accuracy of the two VIc-based classification models was 100%, which is significantly higher than that of the VIs and R-lambda-based models. Among the Anth regression models, the accuracy of the MLR model based on R-lambda + VIs + VIc was the highest (R-c(2) = 0.85; R-v(2) = 0.74). The developed models could accurately identify MDMV and estimate the severity of its infection, laying the theoretical foundation for large-scale remote sensing-based monitoring of this virus in the future.

AB In the present study, land suitability evaluation (qualitative classification) has been determined for Wheat, Barley and corn in Al-Kufa central of Iraq by using remote sensing and GIS as well as soil data. Thirty five sites representing dominant variations within the study area were selected. The study area laying between 31 degrees 59'59.90"N to 32 degrees 10'04.76"N and 44 degrees 19'31.49"E to 44 degrees 34'49.28"E with total area of 27664 ha. Sites were georeferenced on landsat 8 image taken in 2015 using GPS. Soil samples were taken from each of the selected sites and analyzed in laboratory to determine some physical and chemical soil properties. The results revealed that most soils of the study soils are Haplosalids and to some extent the presence of Torrifluvents. Most soils are suffering from salt accumulation. Rating scores for soil properties were evaluated using FAO (2007) system to determine the suitability classes for each soil sites for growing wheat, barley and corn. The results indicated that soils of the study showed different suitability for wheat, Barley and corn and ranging from 57, 37% and 71%, respectively. These variations are due to the degree of tolerance for each crop and to the effect of salt accumulation and to some extent to low content of organic carbon.

AB Agricultural land-use statistics are more informative per-field than per-pixel. Land-use classification requires up-to-date field boundary maps potentially covering large areas containing thousands of farms. This kind of map is usually difficult to obtain. We have developed a new, automated method for deriving closed polygons around fields fromtime-series satellite imagery. We have been using this method operationally in New Zealand to map whole districts using imagery from several satellite sensors, with little need to vary parameters. Our method looks for boundaries-either step edges or linear features-surrounding regions of low variability throughout the time series. Local standard deviations from all image dates are combined, and the result is convolved with a series of extended directional edge filters. We propose that edge linearity over a long distance is a more important criterion than spectral difference for separating fields, so edge responses are thresholded primarily by length rather than strength. The resulting raster edge map (combined from all directions) is converted to vector (GIS) format and the final polygon topology is built. The method successfully segments parcels containing different crops and pasture, as well as those separated by boundaries such as roads and hedgerows. Here we describe the technique and demonstrate it for an agricultural study site (4000 km(2)) using SPOT satellite imagery. We show that our result compares favorably with that from existing segmentation methods in terms of both quantitative quality metrics and suitability for land-use classification.

AB We worked on the assumption that agricultural systems shaped the landscape through human cropping practices, and that the resulting landscape can be described with a set of coarse resolution satellite-derived metrics (spectral, textural, temporal, and spatial metrics). A Random Forest classification model was developed at the village scale in South Mali, based on 100 samples, with data on the main type of agricultural system in each village (three-class typology), and 30 MODIS-derived and socio-environmental metrics calculated on agricultural areas. The model was found to perform well (overall accuracy of 60 percent) and was stable. Class A (food crops) and B (intensive agriculture) displayed good producer's accuracy (70 percent and 67 percent, respectively), while class C (mixed agriculture) was less accurate (50 percent). The most important metrics were shown to be the annual mean of NDVI, followed by the phenology transition dates and texture metrics. However, when considering each set of metrics separately, texture emerged as the most discriminating factor (with 53 percent of global accuracy). This result, i.e., that even coarse resolution imagery contains textural information that can be used for crop mapping, is new. Such maps could be used in food security systems as an indicator of system vulnerability, or as spatial inputs for crop yield models.

AB The Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve (NAOC) is proposed as a new index for remote sensing estimation of the leaf chlorophyll content of heterogeneous areas with different crops, different canopies and different types of bare soil. This index is based on the calculation of the area over the reflectance curve obtained by high spectral resolution reflectance measurements, determined, from the integral of the red-near-infrared interval, divided by the maximum reflectance in that spectral region. For this, use has been made of the experimental data of the SPARC campaigns, where in situ measurements were made of leaf chlorophyll content, LAI and fCOVER of 9 different crops - thus, yielding 300 different values with broad variability of these biophysical parameters. In addition, Proba/CHRIS hyperspectral images were obtained simultaneously to the ground measurements. By comparing the spectra of each pixel with its experimental leaf chlorophyll value, the NAOC was proven to exhibit a linear correlation to chlorophyll content. Calculating the correlation between these variables in the 600-800 nm interval, the best correlation was obtained by computing the integral of the spectral reflectance curve between 643 and 795 nm, which practically covers the spectral range of maximum chlorophyll absorption (at around 670 nm) and maximum leaf reflectance in the infrared (750-800 nm). Based on a Proba/CHRIS image, a chlorophyll map was generated using NAOC and compared with the land-use (crops classification) map. The method yielded a leaf chlorophyll content map of the study area, comprising a large heterogeneous zone. An analysis was made to determine whether the method also serves to estimate the total chlorophyll content of a canopy, multiplying the leaf chlorophyll content by the LAI. To validate the method, use was made of the data from another campaign ((SEN2FLEX), in which measurements were made of different biophysical parameters of 7 crops, and hyperspectral images were obtained with the CASI imaging radiometer from an aircraft. Applying the method to a CASI image, a map of leaf chlorophyll content was obtained, which on, establishing comparisons with the experimental data allowed us to estimate chlorophyll with a root mean square error of 4.2 mu g/cm(2), similar or smaller than other methods but with the improvement of applicability to a large set of different crop types.

AB Rice is one of the world's significant food crops, especially in Egypt. The distribution data of planted and harvested paddy rice fields are essential for food security and the management of water resources. The determined area within agricultural associations is often subjective, expensive, labor intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the paddy rice areas in the Nile Delta using a new methodology based on satellite data. The rice areas could be classified with good results at the beginning of the 1st flooding period applying the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The temporal profiles of NDVI and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were investigated. The NDVI profiles of different targets were analyzed to differentiate between rice and other crops, but the results failed to distinguish between rice and other crops in all stages after full vegetation cover. However, the analyzed LST profiles indicated the discrimination capability between rice and other crops in all vegetation development stages. The accuracy was high as 97% and 74% for LST and NDVI, respectively. The LST-based classification indicated that the distributed rice fields throughout the study area were 32.7% of the total cultivated area. The accuracy of LST results had an advantage over NDVI.

AB The understanding of different characteristics of the stratiform and convective system is important for meteorological research, including precipitation retrievals from satellite observations, precipitation parameterization in numerical prediction models, and precipitation climatology. In this study, the possibility of discriminating rain types using deep learning techniques is examined using satellite microwave observation data. Herein, we build two types of deep neural networks for rain type classification, i.e., U-net (RTC-U-net) and fully connected neural network (RTC-fcNN). Experiments are performed with the data obtained from two sensors onboard the global precipitation measurement (GPM) satellite. The brightness temperatures observed from the GPM microwave imager (GMI) are used as input features, whereas rain types retrieved by dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) are used as labels. We generated the merged 40-x-40 pixel data for training and testing the data set by cropping the GMI observed fields overlapping the DPR observations. Overall, the proposed RTC-U-net and RTC-fcNN effectively classify four rain types, i.e., no-rain, stratiform, convective, and others. The total accuracy for the four rain types is 0.95, and the weighted mean of precision, recall, and f-score for stratiform and convective are 0.76, 0.68, and 0.71, respectively. Results show that the proposed techniques can extract the characteristics of each rain type from the data itself. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a segmentation method with U-net for rain type classification.

AB A satellite-derived cropland extent map at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) is a must for food and water security analysis. Precise and accurate global cropland extent maps, indicating cropland and non-cropland areas, are starting points to develop higher-level products such as crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), cropping intensities (e.g., single, double, or continuous cropping), crop types, cropland fallows, as well as for assessment of cropland productivity (productivity per unit of land), and crop water productivity (productivity per unit of water). Uncertainties associated with the cropland extent map have cascading effects on all higher-level cropland products. However, precise and accurate cropland extent maps at high spatial resolution over large areas (e.g., continents or the globe) are challenging to produce due to the small-holder dominant agricultural systems like those found in most of Africa and Asia. Cloud-based geospatial computing platforms and multi-date, multi-sensor satellite image inventories on Google Earth Engine offer opportunities for mapping croplands with precision and accuracy over large areas that satisfy the requirements of broad range of applications. Such maps are expected to provide highly significant improvements compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser in resolution, and often fail to capture fragmented small-holder farms especially in regions with high dynamic change within and across years. To overcome these limitations, in this research we present an approach for cropland extent mapping at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) using the 10-day, 10 to 20-m, Sentinel-2 data in combination with 16-day, 30-m, Landsat-8 data on Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, nominal 30-m resolution satellite imagery composites were created from 36,924 scenes of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images for the entire African continent in 2015-2016. These composites were generated using a median-mosaic of five bands (blue, green, red, near-infrared, NDVI) during each of the two periods (period 1: January-June 2016 and period 2: July-December 2015) plus a 30-m slope layer derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation dataset. Second, we selected Cropland/Non-cropland training samples (sample size = 9791) from various sources in GEE to create pixel-based classifications. As supervised classification algorithm, Random Forest (RF) was used as the primary classifier because of its efficiency, and when over-fitting issues of RF happened due to the noise of input training data, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to compensate for such defects in specific areas. Third, the Recursive Hierarchical Segmentation (RHSeg) algorithm was employed to generate an object-oriented segmentation layer based on spectral and spatial properties from the same input data. This layer was merged with the pixel-based classification to improve segmentation accuracy. Accuracies of the merged 30-m crop extent product were computed using an error matrix approach in which 1754 independent validation samples were used. In addition, a comparison was performed with other available cropland maps as well as with LULC maps to show spatial similarity. Finally, the cropland area results derived from the map were compared with UN FAO statistics. The independent accuracy assessment showed a weighted overall accuracy of 94%, with a producer's accuracy of 85.9% (or omission error of 14.1%), and user's accuracy of 68.5% (commission error of 31.5%) for the cropland class.
   The total net cropland area (TNCA) of Africa was estimated as 313 Mha for the nominal year 2015. The online product, referred to as the Global Food Security-support Analysis Data @ 30-m for the African Continent, Cropland Extent product (GFSAD30AFCE) is distributed through the NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) as (available for download by 10 November 2017 or earlier): https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30AFCE.001 and can be viewed at https://croplands.org/app/map. Causes of uncertainty and limitations within the crop extent product are discussed in detail.

AB This paper presents a novel strategy for weed monitoring, using images taken with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and concepts of image analysis and machine learning. Weed control in precision agriculture designs site-specific treatments based on the coverage of weeds, where the key is to provide precise weed maps timely. Most traditional remote platforms, e.g. piloted planes or satellites, are, however, not suitable for early weed monitoring, given their low temporal and spatial resolutions, as opposed to he ultra-high spatial resolution of UAVs. The system here proposed makes use of UAV-imagery and is based on: 1) Divide the image, 2) compute and binarise the vegetation indexes, 3) detect crop rows, 4) optimise the parameters and 4) learn a classification model. Since crops are usually organised in rows, the use of a crop row detection algorithm helps to separate properly weed and crop pixels, which is a common handicap given the spectral similitude of both. Several artificial intelligence paradigms are compared in this paper to identify the most suitable strategy for this topic (i.e. unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised approaches). Our experiments also study the effect of different parameteres: the flight altitude, the sensor and the use of previously trained models at a different height. Our results show that 1) very promising performance can be obtained, even when using very few labelled data and 2) the classification model can be learnt in a subplot of the experimental field at low altitude and then applied to the whole field at a higher height, which simplifies the whole process. These results motivate the use of this strategy to design weed monitoring strategies for early post-emergence weed control.

AB A methodology to estimate and map irrigation water volumes is presented. The information used was: (i) crop maps obtained by supervised classification of satellite images; (ii) net water requirements obtained by FAO method from meteorological data; (iii) soil maps; and (iv) irrigation efficiency values. From these data we obtained several graphical and numerical documents related to irrigation water in 1993, 1994 and 1996 in the Flumen district (Spain). After our estimations in the three studied years, the irrigation patterns were quite stable both in the whole irrigated district and by morphopedological unit. The method can be applied in other irrigated areas and will be useful for agricultural and environmental management.

AB Pakistan faces heavy revenue losses in terms of one of its major cash crop i.e. Tobacco, due to the unavailability of accurate statistics of the total tobacco production. During the cropping season, there are many competing crops along with tobacco in the neighboring fields - making tobacco identification a challenging task. This study considers a pilot region of interest that spans over 64844 hectares, in the north-western Pakistan, covered through SPOT5 (2.5m) satellite imagery, acquired on June, 28, 2013. Two supervised pixel based classifiers: (1) minimum distance (MD) and (2) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) are compared and their overall accuracy discussed. The results show that there is no significant difference in the overall classification accuracy of MD and SAM. However, SAM performs better than MD with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 76.56% and 0.7009 respectively. For the specific case of Tobacco crop, MD classifier has producer's accuracy of 81.7% while SAM has that of 70.44%. The study also finds that Euclidean distance (in case of MD) and angle difference (in case of SAM) has no significant difference in classifying land cover types. It is also learnt that if area estimation is the objective, both of the classifiers will under-estimate tobacco covered area.

AB Windbreaks are valuable resources in conserving soils and providing crop protection in Great Plains states in the US. Currently, Kansas has no up-to date inventory of windbreaks. The goal of this project was to assist foresters with future windbreak renovation planning and reporting, by outlining a series of semi-automated digital image processing methods that rapidly identify windbreak locations. There were two specific objectives of this research. First, to develop semi-automated methods to identify the location of windbreaks in Kansas, this can be applied to other regions in Kansas and the Great Plains. We used a remote sensing technique known as object-based image analysis (OBIA) to classify windbreaks visible in the color aerial imagery of National Agriculture Imagery Program. We also combined GIS techniques and field survey to complement OBIA in generating windbreak inventory. The techniques successfully located more than 4500, windbreaks covering an approximate area of 2500, hectares in 14 Kansas counties. The second purpose of this research is to determine how well the results of the automated classification schemes match with other available windbreak data and the selected sample collected in the field. The overall accuracy of OBIA method was 58.97 %. OBIA combined with 'heads up' digitizing and field survey method yielded better result in identifying and locating windbreaks in the studied counties with overall accuracy of 96 %.

AB In tropical/subtropical monsoon regions, accurate rice mapping is hampered by the following factors: (1) The frequent occurrence of clouds in such areas during the rice-growing season interferes strongly with optical remote sensing observations; (2) The agro-landscape in such regions is fragmented and scattered. Rice maps produced using low spatial resolution data cannot well delineate the detailed distribution of rice, while pixel-based mapping using medium and high resolutions has significant salt-and-pepper noise. (3) The cropping system is complex, and rice has a rotation schedule with other crops. Therefore, the Phenology-, Object- and Double Source-based (PODS) paddy rice mapping algorithm is implemented, which consists of three steps: (1) object extraction from multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images where the extracted objects (fields) are the basic classification units; (2) specifying the phenological stage of transplanting from Savitzky-Golay filtered enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series using the PhenoRice algorithm; and (3) the identification of rice objects based on flood signal detection from time-series microwave and optical signals of the Sentinel-1/2. This study evaluated the potential of the combined use of the Sentinel-1/2 mission on paddy rice mapping in monsoon regions with the Hangzhou-Jiaxin-Huzhou (HJH) plain in China as the case study. A cloud computing approach was used to process the available Sentinel-1/2 imagery from 2019 and MODIS images from 2018 to 2020 in the HJH plain on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. An accuracy assessment showed that the resultant object-based paddy rice map has a high accuracy with a producer (user) accuracy of 0.937 (0.926). The resultant 10-m paddy rice map is expected to provide unprecedented detail, spatial distribution, and landscape patterns for paddy rice fields in monsoon regions.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the capability of hyperspectral narrow wavebands within the 400-900 nm range for distinguishing five cash crops commonly grown in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. Data were collected from ten different fields in the West Nipissing agricultural zone (46 degrees 24'N lat., 80 degrees 07'W long.) and included two of each of the following crop types; soybean (Glycine max), canola (Brassica napus L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), oat (Avena sativa), and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to assess the spectral separability of the various crop types under two scenarios; Scenario 1 involved testing separability of crops based on number of days after planting and Scenario 2 involved testing crop separability at specific dates across the growing season. The results indicate that select hyperspectral bands in the visual and near infrared (NIR) regions (400-900 nm) can be used to effectively distinguish the five crop species under investigation. These bands, which were used in a variety of combinations include B465, B485, B495, B515, B525, B535, B545, B625, B645, B665, B675, B695, B705, B715, B725, B735, B745, B755, B765, B815, B825, B885, and B895. In addition, although species classification could be achieved at any point during the growing season, the optimal time for satellite image acquisition was determined to be in late July or approximately 75-79 days after planting with the optimal wavebands located in the red-edge, green, and NIR regions of the spectrum.

AB In previous work we demonstrated the use of temporal image sequences to identify broad land use classes [1]. The approach aims to provide information critical to modeling land use impacts while minimizing reliance on collecting ground control for individual images. Here, we extend the method to include spectral information taken at the peak NDVI stage for each field. Results show the level of spectral separability of various key crops and pastures, and how we have grouped certain crops that are not spectrally separable. Whereas we obtained only 42% classification accuracy when attempting to classify crops individually, the classification accuracy for our crop groups was 81%. A major challenge is that image datasets are typically sparse - due to cloud cover in New Zealand - so the growth stage, and therefore appearance, of individual crops can vary widely in the 'peak' NDVI image.

AB The objective of this paper study delineates the m-delta and m-chi space decomposition methods to determine the behaviour of scattering mechanisms in terms of odd bounce, even bounce and volume component for detection of crops and other land cover targets over parts of Burdwan, West Bengal using hybrid SAR images of India's first microwave Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1). It is observed that volume component is similar in both the decompositions. However, this component is over-estimated as compared to odd and even bounce scattering mechanisms for all land cover targets. The supervised maximum likelihood classification has been performed in this paper.

AB Introduction: Malaria control measures such as early diagnosis and treatment, intermittent treatment of pregnant women, impregnated bed nets, indoor spraying and larval control measures are difficult to target specifically because of imprecise estimates of risk at a small-scale level. Ways of estimating local risks for malaria are therefore important.
   Methods: A high-resolution satellite view from the SPOT 5 satellite during 2008 was used to generate a land cover classification in the malaria endemic lowland of North-Western Burkina Faso. For the area of a complete satellite view of 60 x 60 km, a supervised land cover classification was carried out. Ten classes were built and correlated to land cover types known for acting as Anopheles mosquito breeding sites.
   Results: According to known correlations of Anopheles larvae presence and surface water-related land cover, cultivated areas in the riverine vicinity of Kossi River were shown to be one of the most favourable sites for Anopheles production. Similar conditions prevail in the South of the study region, where clayey soils and higher precipitations benefit the occurrence of surface water. Besides pools, which are often directly detectable, rice fields and occasionally flooded crops represent most appropriate habitats. On the other hand, forests, elevated regions on porous soils, grasslands and the dryer, sandy soils in the north-western part turned out to deliver fewer mosquito breeding opportunities.
   Conclusions: Potential high and low risks for malaria at the village level can be differentiated from satellite data. While much remains to be done in terms of establishing correlations between remotely sensed risks and malaria disease patterns, this is a potentially useful approach which could lead to more focused disease control programmes.

AB Land cover change in any ecosystem vary in space and time. The study analyzed spatial-temporal land cover change to predict forest degradation pressure points in Eastern Mau Forest Reserve. The study objectives were to determine types and amount of spatial-temporal land cover change; land cover change drivers and; forest resources use sustainability. The study used mixed sample survey design involving purposive sampling of spatial data and cluster sampling of forest resource use data. Primary data included ground control points, field validation data and forest resource use data. Secondary data included Landsat imagery, forest and administration boundaries and settlements data. Analysis was done for 1986-2014 period using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System. The analysis techniques used included object based image segmentation and classification, accuracy assessment and land cover change detection. Land cover types in Eastern Mau Forest consisted of indigenous forest, shrubland, grassland, plantation forest, cultivated fields, bare ground and built-up area. The analysis results depicted that cultivated fields coverage increased from 1% to 47%. Indigenous and plantation forests decreased from 43% to 36% and 34% to 7% respectively. Grassland and shrubland decreased from 16% to 8% and 6% to 2% respectively. Bare ground and built up area had a change of less than 1% each. Causes of pressure that lead to forest degradation included crop cultivation, settlement construction, livestock grazing, charcoal burning, firewood collection, logging, bee keeping and medicinal herbs extraction. Land cover change was more on the eastern side than on the western side. Indigenous and plantation forests were likely to disappear if cropland and built up area expansions were to remain unchecked. The study recommendations were: resettlement activities be eliminated in the Eastern Mau Forest; excision of forest land for crop cultivation should be discouraged; and scientific research should be carried out on sustainable plantation forest activities.

AB Coffee is an extremely important cash crop, yet previous work indicates that satellite mapping of coffee has produced low classification accuracy. This research examines spectral band combinations and ancillary data for evaluating the classification accuracy and the nature of spectral confusion between coffee and other cover types in a Costa Rican study area. Supervised classification using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) with only red, near-infrared, and mid-infrared bands had significantly lower classification accuracy compared to datasets that included more spectral bands and ancillary data. The highest overall accuracy achieved was 65%, including a coffee environmental stratification model (CESM). Producer's and user's accuracy was highest for shade coffee plantations (91.8 and 61.1%) and sun coffee (86.2 and 68.4%) with band combination ETM + 34567, NDVI, cos (i), and including the use of the CESM. Post-classification stratification of the optimal coffee growing zone based on elevation and precipitation data did not show significant improvement in land cover classification accuracy when band combinations included both the thermal band and NDVI. A forward stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that ETM + 5 (mid-infrared band) had the highest discriminatory power. The best discriminatory subset for all woody cover types including coffee excluded ETM + 3 and 7; however, the land cover accuracy assessment indicated that overall accuracy, as well as producer's and user's accuracy of shade and sun coffee, were slightly improved with the inclusion of these bands. Although spectral separation between coffee crops and woodland areas was only moderately successful in the Costa Rica study, the overall accuracy, as well as the sun and shade coffee producer's and user's accuracy, were higher than reported in previous research.

AB Developing countries are vulnerable to tropical cyclones due to climatic variability and the frequency and magnitude of some extreme weather and disaster events is likely to increase. Cities and towns situated along the coastal belt of Visakhapatnam district experienced severe damage because of Hudhub cyclone (12 October 2014). The main objective of this research was to identify and quantify the damage to agriculture and vegetation caused by Hudhud cyclone. In this study, landsat-8 satellite data-sets acquired before and after the cyclone have been used; image processing techniques have been carried out to assess the changes of pre- and post-cyclone condition. Economic loss of agriculture crops has been assessed using crop production loss per hectare and total economic loss for agriculture crops in the study area was calculated. Classification results and land use land cover change analysis show that 13.25% of agriculture-Kharif and 31.1% of vegetation was damaged. Crop Biomass was estimated with aid of crop conversion factor for pre- and post-cyclone conditions. Total Above ground biomass' of the agriculture crop area was estimated at 31.57t/ha and total loss of biomass was assessed to be 4.2t/ha. Carbon stock was found to be varying from 0.3 to 8.3t.C/ha in specific agriculture crops. From the results, it was concluded that Hudhud has done significant damage to the rural and urban areas of Visakhapatnam. The outcome of this study can be used by decision-makers for the release of post disaster relief fund to affected areas.

AB Irrigation is crucial to agriculture in arid and semi-arid areas and significantly contributes to crop development, food diversity and the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. For a specific crop, the separation of its irrigated and rainfed areas is difficult, because their phenology is similar and therefore less distinguishable, especially when there are phenology shifts due to various factors, such as elevation and latitude. In this study, we present a simple, but robust method to map irrigated and rainfed wheat areas in a semi-arid region of China. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at a 30 x 30 m spatial resolution derived from the Chinese HJ-1A/B (HuanJing(HJ) means environment in Chinese) satellite to create a time series spanning the whole growth period of wheat from September 2010 to July 2011. The maximum NDVI and time-integrated NDVI (TIN) that usually exhibit significant differences between irrigated and rainfed wheat were selected to establish a classification model using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The overall accuracy of the Google-Earth testing samples was 96.0%, indicating that the classification results are accurate. The estimated irrigated-to-rainfed ratio was 4.4:5.6, close to the estimates provided by the agricultural sector in Shanxi Province. Our results illustrate that the SVM classification model can effectively avoid empirical thresholds in supervised classification and realistically capture the magnitude and spatial patterns of rainfed and irrigated wheat areas. The approach in this study can be applied to map irrigated/rainfed areas in other regions when field observational data are available.

AB A new method to identify short-rotation eucalyptus plantations by exploring both the changing pattern of vegetation indices due to tree crop rotation and spectral characteristics of eucalyptus in the red-edge region is presented. It can be adopted to produce eucalyptus maps of high spatial resolution (30 m) at large scales, with the use of open remote sensing images from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), as well as a free cloud computing platform, Google Earth Engine (GEE). The method is composed of three main steps. First, a time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is constructed from Landsat data for each pixel, and a statistical hypothesis testing is followed to determine whether the pixel belongs to a tree plantation or not based on the idea that tree crops should be harvested in a specific period. Then, a broadleaf/needleleaf classification is applied to distinguish eucalyptus from coniferous trees such as pine and fir using the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data. Refinements based on superpixel are performed at last to remove the salt-and-pepper effects resulted from per-pixel detection. The proposed method allows gaps in the time series that are very common in tropical and subtropical regions by employing time series segmentation and statistical hypothesis testing, and could capture forest disturbances such as conversion of natural forest or agricultural lands to eucalyptus plantations emerged in recent years by using a short observing time. The experiment in Guangxi province of China demonstrated that the method had an overall accuracy of 87.97%, with producer's accuracy of 63.85% and user's accuracy of 66.89% for eucalyptus plantations.

AB The development of Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) is a vital step in sustainable agricultural development. This study proposes a quantitative method for developing the AEZs and land suitability for Wadi El-Grawla, North-Western Coastal Region (NWCR), Egypt. Hundreds of surface soil samples and twenty soil profiles covering the variations in the study area were collected; then, the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique was utilized to produce representative maps for different soil characteristics. Moreover, a digital elevation model (DEM) was generated from topographic maps to calculate various land surface factors such as slope, curvature, and relief density. In addition to benefiting from Sentinel-2 imagery in the separation process of different landform units with a classification accuracy of about 87%. Two soil orders were identified in the study area, namely, Aridisols and Entisols. Chemical analysis of soil samples revealed that soil pH range from 7.14 to 8.6. Total soluble salt changes widely from one location to another. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) has a wide range of 3.5-31.5%. Organic matter (OM) ranges between 0.04 and 1.55%. A weighted overlay of obtained thematic maps resulted in three management zones in the Wadi El-Grawla area. Zone-1 represents the best location, with an area of about 2359.3 ha. At the same time, the regions of the area of zone-2 and zone-3 are 2526.4 ha and 1346.8 ha, respectively. Finally, suitability maps were produced for the most strategic crops cultivated in Wadi El-Grawla. The most suitable classes were S2 and S3 for all studied crops. The obtained results will support the decision-makers to put various development plans according to the conditions of the study area.(C) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

AB Reliable information about the geographic distribution and abundance of major plant functional types (PFTs) around the world is increasingly needed for global change research. Using remote sensing techniques to map PFTs is a relatively recent field of research. This paper presents a method to map PFTs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a multisource evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm. The method first utilizes a suite of improved and standard MODIS products to generate evidence measures for each PFT class. The multiple lines of evidence computed from input data are then combined using Dempster's Rule of combination. Finally, a decision rule based on maximum support is used to make classification decisions. The proposed method was tested over the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and North Dakota, USA where crops dominate. The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture were employed to validate our new PFT maps and the current MODIS PFT product. Our preliminary results suggest that multisource data fusion is a promising approach to improve the mapping of PFTs. For several major PFT classes such as crop, trees, and grass and shrub, the PFT maps generated with the ER method provide greater spatial details compared to the MODIS PFT. The overall accuracies increased for all the four states, with the biggest improvement occurring in Iowa from 5 1 % (MODIS) to 64% (ER). The overall kappa statistic also increased for all the four states, with the biggest improvement occurring in Iowa from 0.03 (MODIS) to 0.38 (ER). The paper concludes with a discussion of several methodological issues pertaining to the further improvement of the ER approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

AB Multi-temporal Landsat data covering the Bawku West district of Ghana were aligned to the agro-ecological calendar to map agricultural land use. Phenological curves based on NDVI and NIR were extracted. A decision tree classification based on the curves enabled the mapping of six broad classes. Results indicate the successful discrimination of irrigated land from other land use classes, but also the problem of separating natural vegetation from quasi-natural rainfed agriculture. This problem is attributed to the scale on which agriculture is practiced (small scale) and the inadequate spatial and temporal resolution of the Landsat instrument to capture the agricultural fields and cropping systems. In the following months multi-temporal (monthly) 6.5-meter RapidEye, complemented with 6-meter TerraSAR-X observations in the rainy season will be acquired for 2012 and 2013. The synergetic analysis of data from these satellite systems with contemporary field data on cropping cycles promises to improve agricultural land use mapping in this savanna region.

AB This paper presents innovative methods for using satellite image time series to produce land use and land cover classification over large areas in Brazil from 2001 to 2016. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data to classify natural and human-transformed land areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's agricultural frontier. Our hypothesis is that building high-dimensional spaces using all values of the time series, coupled with advanced statistical learning methods, is a robust and efficient approach for land cover classification of large data sets. We used the full depth of satellite image time series to create large dimensional spaces for statistical classification. The data consist of MODIS MOD13Q1 time series with 23 samples per year per pixel, and 4 bands (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), near-infrared (nir) and mid-infrared (mir)). By taking a series of labelled time series, we fed a 92 dimensional attribute space into a support vector machine model. Using a 5-fold cross validation, we obtained an overall accuracy of 94% for discriminating among nine land cover classes: forest, cerrado, pasture, soybean fallow, fallow-cotton, soybean-cotton, soybean-corn, soybean-millet, and soybean-sunflower. Producer and user accuracies for all classes were close to or better than 90%. The results highlight important trends in agricultural intensification in Mato Grosso. Double crop systems are now the most common production system in the state, sparing land from agricultural production. Pasture expansion and intensification has been less studied than crop expansion, although it has a stronger impact on deforestation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our results point to a significant increase in the stocking rate in Mato Grosso and to the possible abandonment of pasture areas opened in the state's frontier. The detailed land cover maps contribute to an assessment of the interplay between production and protection in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado biomes.

AB Crop type mapping provides essential information to control and make decisions related to agricultural practices and their regulations. To map crop types accurately, it is important to capture their phenological stages and fine spatial details, especially in a temporally and spatially heterogeneous landscape. The data availability of new generation multispectral sensors of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites offers unprecedented options for such applications. Given this, our study aims to display how the synergistic use of these optical sensors can efficiently support crop type mapping research while integrating an object-based image analysis (OBIA). Through the applied methods, we used the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data-fusion model (FSDAF) to blend L8 and S2 data and obtain reliable normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets with fine spatial and temporal resolution. Then the crop phenological information was extracted using a Savitzky-Golay filter and fused NDVI time series. Finally, a model combining phenological metrics and fused reconstructed NDVI as classification features was developed using a random forest (RF) classifier/OBIA approach. The results show that the FSDAF method creates more accurate fused NDVI and keeps more spatial details than ESTARFM. The FSDAF model was then used to create fused, high-resolution time-series products that were able to extract crop phenology in single-crop fields while providing a very detailed pattern relative to that from individual sensor time-series data. Moreover, combined L8 and S2 data by FSDAF produced highly significant overall classification accuracies (90.03% for pixel-based RF to 93.12% OBIA RF), outperforming individual sensor use (82.57% for L8-only; 88.45% for S2-only). Our proposed workflow highlights the advantage of spatiotemporal fusing and OBIA environment in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas and fragmented landscapes, which represents a promising step toward generating fast, accurate, and ready-to-use agricultural data products.

AB Land cover is a spatial information of great relevance for a variety of models for estimating sediment yield and to measure the potential of the landscape carbon sequestration. The classification of land cover by the supervised method requires training areas, these areas must be representative of each class of land cover. For the classification decision tree (DT) algorithm, the complexity of DT, results in different values of accuracies for thematic maps. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the minimum sample density in a DT model which would allow to discriminate land cover classes, evaluate the size of the generated DT model, as well as, identify the more difficult land cover class to be mapped. Satellite images from RESOURCESAT-1as well as spectral indices were used in the study. The minimum sample density varied between 0.15 and 0.30% of the total area for each class, this sampling interval allowed better results than 80% for kappa index. The smallest grouping of observations in the same terminal leaf was 45 observations. In this study the most difficult land use classes to be mapped were forest and rice crops due to spectral similarity of shaded forests with irrigated rice crops.

AB Soil mapping of salt-affected and shallow water table areas was carried out using satellite imagery, an electromagnetic device and geographic information systems in the Rio Fuerte Irrigation District, Mexico. Salt-affected fields were sampled to evaluate soil electrical conductivity, and yield. The spectral values from TM2, TM3 and TM4 bands were taken from Landsat images, and regression models were obtained to estimate soil salinity and crop yield. Supervised classifications were run from these models in order to get partial maps. Non-classified areas were mapped in situ using an electromagnetic device and a positioning system (GPS), and a second partial map was generated. By overlapping the partial maps, a final map was obtained. Shallow water table areas were incorporated to the salinity map in order to get the affected areas with both high soil salinity and shallow water table. The relationship between soil salinity and yield was analyzed to quantify the effect of salinity on crop yield.

AB Seasonal variations in weather have significant impacts on crop yields. The accuracy of weather data is an important consideration for crop yield models. This study uses an independent in-situ weather station network to validate the accuracy of monthly temperature and precipitation data from the in-situ weather station network operated by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), interpolated gridded data from this network, and satellite weather data for the South West Agricultural Region of Australia. This region covers five classes of the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system and is responsible for 10 billion AUD of agricultural produce annually. A strong bias was found for the maximum temperatures in the Copernicus LST (land surface temperature) satellite product. This bias was linearly correlated with the in-situ temperature and exceeded 20 degrees C in warmer months. Due to the bias's linear nature, a linear correction was able to reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the Copernicus LST product by 82%. This process was tested for other regions of Australia and, despite some regional differences, a linear correction consistently reduced RMSE by 80%. The validation process demonstrated that the dataset with reliably the lowest RMSE is the gridded weather data calculated from BOM's in-situ weather stations. Nearest neighbor in-situ weather stations generally had the next lowest RMSE, followed by weather-station corrected satellite products and lastly the non-weather station corrected satellite products. While the in-situ gridded product generally had the lowest RMSE, there were spatial and seasonal variations. Monthly maximum temperatures were more accurately measured by the bias-corrected Copernicus LST product in the northern and eastern extents (where there is a lower density of BOM in-situ stations). Monthly minimum temperatures from the Copernicus LST product had similar to slightly better RMSE than the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) product for the southern half of the study area and the rain-gauge corrected GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) product performed similarly to AWAP in the drier months (November-April).

AB In the context of required increase of food production for rapid population growth, it is critical to improve the productivity of water in the irrigation systems. It may require a lot of field investigations to gather this information at large and especially complex systems like the Liyuankou Irrigation System (LIS), located in located on the right bank of Yellow River in North West China. The use of geo-information techniques such as remote sensing and GIS data has come to override most of the difficulties encountered in collection of large amount of data, especially following the state-of-the-art development on the calculation of actual evapotranspiration.
   The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) has been applied to 13 NOAA-AVHRR 11-12 images in the LIS for the summer season (April-October) of 1994. This analysis was aided by the unsupervised land use classification applied to Landsat 5 TM image at the peak of growing season over the study area. The water accounting and productivity framework was applied to measure both the water use within the system and the water productivity of LIS.
   Unsupervised classification (ISODATA clustering algorithm) was applied to Landsat 5 TM image and the results showed that agricultural crop classification has accuracy greater than 81% and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient associated with classification are 78% and 0.75, respectively. SEBAL results showed that a large amount of water (210 MCM) was lost through non-beneficial ET including from fallow land, bare soil, water bodies and others during 1994. Similarly, a considerable amount of water (125 MCM) was lost through evaporation from fallow land during 1994, which needs to be reduced to improve water productivity of the irrigation system.
   The process fraction per unit of depleted water PFdepleted is 0.47 for LIS, meaning that 47% of the depleted water is consumed by the agricultural crop and 53% is lost through non-process depletion. The results also prove earlier findings of Khan et al., (2006) that high amount of water is depleted through non-process depletion for LIS. WPirrigation is 0.94 kg/m(3) which show that there is a considerable scope for improvement in our study area by reducing the nonbeneficial outflows from agriculture fields and/or by increasing the yield. Results proved that geo information techniques are providing cost effective way (free NOAA-AVHRR images) for spatial mapping and assessing water productivity factors at different spatial scales, answering to water management for better decision making requirements.

AB Most natural rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) are grown on plantations, making rubber an important industrial crop. Rubber plantations are also an important source of household income for over 20 million people. The accurate mapping of rubber plantations is important for both local governments and the global market. Remote sensing has been a widely used approach for mapping rubber plantations, typically using optical remote sensing data obtained at the regional scale. Improving the efficiency and accuracy of rubber plantation maps has become a research hotspot in rubber-related literature. To improve the classification efficiency, researchers have combined the phenology, geography, and texture of rubber trees with spectral information. Among these, there are three main classifiers: maximum likelihood, QUEST decision tree, and random forest methods. However, until now, no comparative studies have been conducted for the above three classifiers. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the mapping accuracy based on these three classifiers, using four kinds of data input: Landsat spectral information, phenology-Landsat spectral information, topography-Landsat spectral information, and phenology-topography-Landsat spectral information. We found that the random forest method had the highest mapping accuracy when compared with the maximum likelihood and QUEST decision tree methods. We also found that adding either phenology or topography could improve the mapping accuracy for rubber plantations. When either phenology or topography were added as parameters within the random forest method, the kappa coefficient increased by 5.5% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to the kappa coefficient for the baseline Landsat spectral band data input. The highest accuracy was obtained from the addition of both phenology-topography-Landsat spectral bands to the random forest method, achieving a kappa coefficient of 97%. We therefore mapped rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna using the random forest method, with the addition of phenology and topography information from 1990-2020. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of integrating phenology and topography for mapping rubber plantations. The machine learning approach showed great potential for accurate regional mapping, particularly by incorporating plant habitat and ecological information. We found that during 1990-2020, the total area of rubber plantations had expanded to over three times their former area, while natural forests had lost 17.2% of their former area.

AB The widespread rural electrification during the 1970s and 1980s attracted tubewell technology, which boosted the area's agricultural economy. However, groundwater pumping soon became over-pumping, causing deterioration of the aquifer. Since groundwater has historically been the central source of irrigation here, its deterioration affected agriculture in several ways. This chapter examines land use dynamics of tubewell agriculture, first through field survey data results of which are then validated by satellite images. The phrase 'agricultural development' means growth (new additions) and modification (re-alignment) of an agricultural system. Therefore, this chapter incorporates horizontal (expansion) and vertical (intensification) growth trends in agriculture, cropping pattern alterations, and the economic performance of farming in the face of high irrigation costs. The spreading desertification process has been highlighted both by the field survey results and by satellite image classification. Since farmers are the key stakeholders in the agricultural enterprise, their socio-economic features are unveiled first of all.

AB The knowledge on reliable estimates of areas under sugarcane cultivation is essential for the Brazilian agribusiness, since it helps in the development of public policies, in determining prices by sugar mills to producers and allows establishing the logistics of production disposal. The objective of this work was to develop a methodology for mapping the sugarcane crop area in the state of Parana, Brazil, using images from the Landsat/TM/OLI and IRS/LISS-3 satellites, for the crop years from 2010/2011 to 2013/2014. The mappings were conducted through the supervised Maximum likelihood classification (Maxver) achieving, on average, an overall accuracy of 94.13% and kappa index of 0.82. The correlation with the official data of the IBGE ranged from moderate to strong (0.64 <= r(s) <= 0.80) with average agreement (dr) of 0.81. There was an increase of 2.73% (18,630 ha) in the area with sugarcane in Parana between 2010/2011 and 2013/2014.

AB Land cover plays an integral role in urban management as a source of information to support authorities' decision making. Recently, computer vision methods, machine learning algorithms in particular, are increasingly used for land cover and land use mapping, which can help make these processes more efficient and more affordably. To this end, this paper focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence using convolutional neural network (CNN) to propose a new method for land cover mapping. A first CNN model is trained with a large number of 4 image classes to obtain a land cover model. We then apply the model directly on satellite images that are cropped into images of the same size as the training images. The results of the direct application of the model is not satisfactory; in particular, it confuses water and forested areas. The paper propose a different approach where land cover model is obtained by combining 2 models in series. The first model is a binary-class CNN model which contains classification of two classes (water, land) while the second model is a three-class CNN model containing classification of land, excluding non-water areas. Global accuracy obtained is 98% and 91% for the binary- and three-class CNN model respectively. This approach is used successfully on large area satellite images.

AB Soil salinity and yield were studied in the Valle del Carrizo, Rio Yaqui and Rio Mayo irrigation districts (ID) using satellite imagery. The reference crops evaluated were wheat (Triticum aestivium), cotton (Gossipium hirsutum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Soil salinity of the cropped areas was detected by correlating soil electrical conductivity determined at point sites within previously designated fields, to spectral values extracted from the green (TM2), red (TM3) and infrared (TM4) bands of the Landsat images. Yield samples were also collected around the same points, and multiple regression models were developed to estimate crop yield. The planted areas were digitized on the images to obtain an unsupervised classification and all the pixels were grouped by reflectance. Based on the multiple regression models, codes were created to classify all the pixels into several classes to generate salinity and yield maps. The total area of the three irrigation districts encompasses 466,927 ha, from which 231,378 ha were mapped, and 135,094 ha (58%) were classified as saline land (EC > 4 dS.m(-1)). A total loss of 104, 000 tons of wheat, 8,900 tons of cotton, and 28, 100 tons of sorghum was estimated.

AB The flooded areas of corn cultivation were determined by means of satellite images in order to know the economic losses due to floods. As a case study, a flood that occurred in 2016 that affected 4 municipalities in the State of Tabasco, Mexico, was analyzed. The methodology included the use of Landsat satellite images (L8), calculation of spectral indices (water, vegetation and humidity), identification of corn growing areas through supervised classification and the estimation of economic losses. The results show that the spectral indices that best managed to identify the flooded areas were: MNDWI and NDWI. To report damages, values in USD (US dollars) were standardized in 2016 prices using exchange rates adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). For the case study, the results of damages per hectare were established between 728.57 USD / ha in PPP and 317.25 USD / ha in PPP, which agree with the estimates made in other countries for corn crops.

AB Crop identification on specific parcels and the assessment of soil management practices are important for agro-ecological studies, greenhouse gas modeling, and agrarian policy development. Traditional pixel-based analysis of remotely sensed data results in inaccurate identification of some crops due to pixel heterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop pattern variability. These problems can be overcome using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques, which incorporate new spectral, textural and hierarchical features after segmentation of imagery. We combined OBIA and decision tree (DT) algorithms to develop a methodology, named Object-based Crop Identification and Mapping (OCIM), for a multi-seasonal assessment of a large number of crop types and field status.
   In our approach, we explored several vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features derived from visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER satellite scenes collected during three distinct growing-season periods (mid-spring, early-summer and late-summer). OCIM was developed for 13 major crops cultivated in the agricultural area of Yolo County in California, USA. The model design was built in four different scenarios (combinations of three or two periods) by using two independent training and validation datasets and the best DTs resulted in an error rate of 9% for the three-period model and between 12 and 16% for the two-period models. Next, the selected DT was used for the thematic classification of the entire cropland area and mapping was then evaluated applying the confusion matrix method to the independent testing dataset that reported 79% overall accuracy. OCIM detected intra-class variations in most crops attributed to variability from local crop calendars, tree-orchard structures and land management operations. Spectral variables (based on VIs) contributed around 90% to the models, although textural variables were necessary to discriminate between most of the permanent crop-fields (orchards, vineyard, alfalfa and meadow). Features extracted from late-summer imagery contributed around 60% in classification model development, whereas mid-spring and early-summer imagery contributed around 30 and 10%, respectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the main groups of crops based on the presence and vigor of green vegetation within the fields, contributing around 50% to the models. In addition, other VIs based on SWIR bands were also crucial to crop identification because of their potential to detect field properties like moisture, vegetation vigor, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil. The OCIM method was built using interpretable rules based on physical properties of the crops studied and it was successful for object-based feature selection and crop identification.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a popular class of techniques for performing soft classifications of satellite images. They have successfully been applied for estimating crop areas through sub-pixel classification of medium to low resolution images. Before a network can be used for classification and estimation, however, it has to be trained. The collection of the reference area fractions needed to train an ANN is often both time-consuming and expensive. This study focuses on strategies for decreasing the efforts needed to collect the necessary reference data, without compromising the accuracy of the resulting area estimates. Two aspects were studied: the spatial sampling scheme (i) and the possibility for reusing trained networks in multiple consecutive seasons (ii). Belgium was chosen as the study area because of the vast amount of reference data available. Time series of monthly NDVI composites for both SPOT-VGT and MODIS were used as the network inputs. The results showed that accurate regional crop area estimation (R-2 > 80%) is possible using only 1% of the entire area for network training, provided that the training samples used are representative for the land use variability present in the study area. Limiting the training samples to a specific subset of the population, either geographically or thematically, significantly decreased the accuracy of the estimates. The results also indicate that the use of ANNs trained with data from one season to estimate area fractions in another season is not to be recommended. The interannual variability observed in the endmembers' spectral signatures underlines the importance of using up-to-date training samples. It can thus be concluded that the representativeness of the training samples, both regarding the spatial and the temporal aspects, is an important issue in crop area estimation using ANNs that should not easily be ignored.

AB In recent years, cultivation methods of rice have been diversified due to the low cost of rice-growing techniques. For example, there is direct sowing of seed rice in paddy field in addition to the practice of usual paddy field to flooding at the time of planting. The yield of the usual paddy field and the direct sowing is different even though the same varieties are grown in the same area. It is necessary to grasp by performing classification for the usual paddy field or direct sowing for the management of agricultural crops. The main objective of this study was to select the observation time for the classification of paddy fields' planting conditions by utilizing Synthetic Aperture Radar TerraSAR-X satellite. The planting conditions included the usual planting of rice, the direct sowing of rice and the soybean. We selected the observation time by the statistical distance of the microwave backscattering in each paddy field for maximizing the planting condition classification. In addition, the satellite data observation timing considered the processing time of the analysis and the acquisition costs. The acquisition was performed 4 periods from 2 periods in the rice growing season and the planting phase. In the current study, we were able to classify the usual planting of rice, the direct sowing of rice and the soybean by TerraSAR-X data for the later planting of rice during mid-May and initial growth of rice in early June.

AB Nitrogen is an important nutrient element for crop growth. A timely understanding of plant nitrogen information helps to adopt appropriate agricultural production management to maintain high yield and quality in wheat production. Crop spectral monitoring technology can obtain the leaf nitrogen content (LNC) information of wheat quickly and nondestructively. However, optical radiation interacts with the atmosphere, the canopy, and the soil before being captured by the sensor, and the capability to intercept, reflect, and transmit the radiation is different for different canopy structures. In wheat LNC monitoring, differences in target canopy structures will lead to changes in canopy reflectance, which can affect the monitoring accuracy. In this study, RGB and depth images were used to obtain wheat canopy structure indices. By analyzing the correlations between wheat LNC, canopy structure indices, and spectral reflectance, the indices that had large influence on spectral reflectance were screened; the change dynamics of these canopy structure indices under different internal and external factors were compared, and factors with greater impact were selected as the basis for grouping. On this basis, this study used the spectral indices RVI (660, 815) and RVI (730, 815) as fixed-effect variables and wheat population grouping variables as random-effect variables to construct linear mixed models of wheat LNC. In addition, the spectral indices and canopy structure indices were used as input parameters and wheat population grouping variables as output parameters to construct a random forest classifier for wheat canopy types. When monitoring the target population, we first predicted the classification of the unknown canopy by the classifier. The classification results and spectral indices were then input into the linear mixed models to realize the prediction of wheat LNC. The R2 of the prediction for wheat LNC with RVI (660, 815) and RVI (730, 815) increased from 0.57 and 0.71 to 0.76 and 0.80, respectively, and the RRMSE decreased from 20.86% and 17.33% to 15.58% and 14.20%, respectively. This study used digital image information to compensate for spectral information, broadened the amount of information used for the remote sensing monitoring of farmland, and effectively improved the accuracy and universality of wheat LNC monitoring.

AB Spatiotemporal data fusion algorithms have been developed to fuse satellite imagery from sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions and generate predicted imagery. In this study, we compare the predictions of three spatiotemporal data fusion algorithms in blending Landsat-8/OLI and Terra-Aqua/MODIS images for mapping soybean and corn under five classification scenarios. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), and Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) algorithms were compared to generate images for the 2016/2017 summer crop-year. Classifications including phenological metrics extracted from FSDAF- and STARFM-predicted EVI time series had overalls accuracies higher than the other scenarios, 93.11% and 91.33%, respectively. The results show that phenological metrics extracted from predicted images are an interesting alternative to overcome cloud cover frequency limitations for soybean and corn mapping in tropical areas.

AB Logistic regression models are a popular and effective method to predict the probability of categorical response data. However, inference for these models can become computationally prohibitive for large datasets. Here we adapt ideas from symbolic data analysis to summarize the collection of predictor variables into histogram form, and perform inference on this summary dataset. We develop ideas based on composite likelihoods to derive an efficient one-versus-rest approximate composite likelihood model for histogram-based random variables, constructed from low-dimensional marginal histograms obtained from the full histogram. We demonstrate that this procedure can achieve comparable classification rates to the standard full data multinomial analysis and against state-of-the-art subsampling algorithms for logistic regression, but at a substantially lower computational cost. Performance is explored through simulated examples, and analyses of large supersymmetry and satellite crop classification datasets. for this article are available online.

AB Based on satellite data in different temporal and spatial resolution, the current use of frequency distribution functions (PDF) for surface parameters and energy fluxes is one of the most promising ways to describe subgrid heterogeneity of a landscape. Objective of this study is to find typical distribution patterns of parameters (albedo, NDVI) for the determination of the actual latent heat flux (L. E) determined from highly resolved satellite data within pixel on coarser scale. Landsat ETM+, Terra MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR surface temperature and spectral reflectance were used to infer further surface parameters and radiant- and energy flux densities for LITFASS-area, a 20x20 km(2) heterogeneous area in Eastern Germany, mainly characterised by the land use types forest, crop, grass and water. Based on the Penman-Monteith-approach L. E, as key quantity of the hydrological cycle, is determined for each sensor in the accordant spatial resolution with an improved parametrisation. However, using three sensors, significant discrepancies between the inferred parameters can cause flux distinctions resultant from differences of the sensor filter response functions or atmospheric correction methods. The approximation of MODIS- and AVHRR-derived surface parameters to the reference parameters of ETM (via regression lines and histogram stretching, respectively), further the use of accurate land use classifications (CORINE and a new Landsat-classification), and a consistent parametrisation for the three sensors were realized to obtain a uniform base for investigations of the spatial variability. The analyses for 4 scenes in 2002 and 2003 showed that for forest clear distribution-patterns for NDVI and albedo are found. Grass and crop distributions show higher variability and differ significantly to each other in NDVI but only marginal in albedo. Regarding NDVI-distribution functions NDVI was found to be the key variable for L.E-determination.

AB Accurate estimates of cultivated area and crop yield are critical to our understanding of agricultural production and food security, particularly for semi-arid regions like the Sahel of West Africa, where crop production is mainly rain-fed and food security is closely correlated with the inter-annual variations in rainfall. Several global and regional land cover products, based on satellite remotely-sensed data, provide estimates of the agricultural land use intensity, but the initial comparisons indicate considerable differences among them, relating to differences in the satellite data quality, classification approaches, and spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the accuracy of available cropland products across Sahelian West Africa using an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies all points across West Africa using a 2-km sample grid (similar to 500,000 points for the study area). We estimate the quantity and allocation disagreements for the cropland class of eight land cover products in five Western Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). The results confirm that coarse spatial resolution (300 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) land cover products have higher disagreements in mapping the fragmented agricultural landscape of the Western Sahel. Earlier products (e.g., GLC2000) are less accurate than recent products (e.g., ESA CCI 2013, MODIS 2013 and GlobCover 2009). We also show that two of the finer spatial resolution maps (GFSAD30, and GlobeLand30) using advanced classification approaches (random forest, decision trees, and pixel-object combined) are currently the best available products for cropland identification. However, none of the eight land cover databases examined is consistent in reaching the targeted 75% accuracy threshold in the five Sahelian countries. The majority of currently available land cover products overestimate cultivated areas by an average of 170% relative to the cropland area in the reference data.

ID NORTHERN THAILAND
AB A sediment source, transport, and deposition model known as SedNet has been applied to two sub-catchments of the Mae Chaem River in Thailand, the Mae Suk (95 km(2)) and the Mae Kong Kha (91 km2). The applied models were analysed to determine the dominant sources and sinks of suspended sediment in these catchments, and to examine the uncertainty in model inputs and results.
   Two landuse grids were available for these catchments; one in 1995 was derived from satellite imagery and contained a relatively undifferentiated landuse classification (lumping all forest types into one category); the other in 2003 was derived from a mix of satellite imagery, ground truthing, and mapping, and better differentiated between landuse types (dividing forest types into evergreen, deciduous, and pine plantations).
   Results indicate significant differences in sediment export in 2003 compared to 1995, with exports from the Mae Suk reduced by 10 kt/y, and exports for the Mae Kong Kha increased by 6 kt/y. It is difficult to say whether these changes were due to actual changes in landuse between 1995 and 2003, or due to the improved landuse classification in 2003. Given the range of uncertainties associated with these predictions (Figure 1), these relatively small increases / decreases are not significant. The source areas of suspended sediment also changed significantly between 1995 and 2003, and these changes in source area can clearly be linked to the improved mapping of landuse in 2003.
   The improved landuse classification in 2003 also led to significant reductions in the uncertainty associated with the export of suspended sediment from both catchments. The uncertainty in suspended sediment export associated with the landuse classification for the Mae Suk reduced by 23%, while that for the Mae Kong Kha reduced by 17% (Figure 1). These reductions in uncertainty were primarily due to improvements in the classification of forest type, with the range of uncertainty in sediment yield from forests declining from 28.99 kt/y to 12.92 kt/y in the Mae Suk and 26.91 kt/y to 11.44 kt/y in the Mae Kong Kha.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Despite these improvements in landuse classification, significant uncertainty in suspended sediment yield still exist for both sub-catchments. Much of this uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in suspended sediment yields from field crops and fallow fields. There are two reasons for this, firstly, these landuses produce the vast majority of the suspended sediment from the Mae Suk and Mae Kong Kha sub-catchments (75% and 54% respectively), and secondly, the landuse grids do not distinguish the type of crop being grown. This leads to a large range in the possible values of the C-factor used in the USLE grid, from 0.25 to 0.79. Further improvements in identifying the total volume, source areas, and uncertainty in suspended sediment yields will best be achieved through an improved landuse coverage which identifies the type of crop being grown.

AB This study presents a preliminary assessment of the potentialities of the COSMO-SkyMed (R) (CSK (R)) satellite constellation to accurately classify different crops. The experiment is focused on the main crops grown in the agricultural region of Marchfeld (Austria) namely carrot, corn, potato, soybean and sugar beet. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was fed with temporally dense series of backscattering coefficients extracted from a stack of CSK (R) GTC products. In particular, twenty one CSK (R) dual polarization (11 HH, 10 VH) images were acquired over the site for the growing season (early April - mid October) in Stripmap Himage mode, with a nominal incidence angle at scene center of 40 degrees. A comparison of the classifications obtained at the two different polarizations are reported and the results are analyzed in terms of the achieved accuracies. The SVM method was able to classify all five crop types with an overall accuracy of 81.6% (Kappa 0.77) at VH polarization and of 84.5% (Kappa 0.80) at HH polarization. Sugar beet, potato and carrot were accurately identified with OA never less than 83% at both polarizations, whereas corn and soybean showed remarkably differences in terms of producer's and user's accuracies, probably due to particular agricultural practices adopted for these two crop species. These first results show that the CSK (R) capability of acquiring temporally dense data sets can accurately identify several crop types.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has operational applications in crop mapping and monitoring in many countries due to the distinct backscatter signature at various stages of crop growth. Polarimetric analysis of SAR data from different satellites was used for information extraction from different types of scatters in imaged terrain. The scattering processes were analyzed through the received scatter matrix derived from the target decomposition of SAR data. Three decomposition techniques, namely Freeman-Durden, Cloude-Pottier and Touzi decomposition of the ALOS PALSAR-1 data, were used in this study to extract land use/cover information with a specific emphasis on agriculture. The decomposed output parameters from these techniques were classified with supervised classifier of support vector machine (SVM) using region of interest (ROI) selected land use/cover classes. An accuracy assessment for the classified output was carried out using the ROI. The Ramgarh village in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan with the predominance of agricultural land, sand dunes and settlements was chosen as the study area. Freeman-Durden decomposition resulted in the highest overall accuracy of about 85% in the land use/cover classification among the three decomposition techniques adopted in the study. It was also observed that the accuracy of land use/cover mapping derived from Cloude-Pottier and Touzi decompositions improved with the use of eigenvalues in the SVM classification. Higher accuracies in the classification of agriculture land were noted with all the three decomposition techniques. The four parameters of Cloude-Pottier (H, A, alpha, beta) and Touzi (alpha(s), Phi(s), psi, tau) decompositions improved the classification accuracy for all the classes due to eigenvalues. The overall classification accuracy was above 88% for both the decomposition techniques with four parameters. The soil moisture values for agriculture land and sand dunes were validated through soil moisture maps generated using Oh 1992 and 2004 models.

AB Management of agricultural soils, most notably tillage, influences wind, and water erosion, which in turn has implications for non-point source pollution of pesticides, fertilizer, and sediment in agro-ecosystems. No-till (NT) practices improve soil, water, and aquatic ecosystem quality by reducing soil erosion and chemical runoff. The ability of cropland soils to sequester C from the atmosphere might help mitigate global warming. Classification of Landsat ETM+ satellite images has the potential to identify tillage practices and soil disturbance over large areas, enabling efficient monitoring of these agricultural practices. Previous studies predicting tillage management had relatively small study areas (located in a single county), relatively low numbers of fields (6-51), and were temporally focused on non-planted fields to reduce the potential effects of crop canopy interference and/or field patterning. Our objectives were to predict in the presence of crop canopy and over a spatially large, management diverse study area (1) tillage systems (NT versus tilled) and (2) soil disturbance. A farm survey of the study area, north central Montana, was used to as a means to obtain extensive field-level farm management data. We compared logistic regression (LR), traditional classification tree analysis (CTA), and boosted classification tree analysis (BCTA) for identifying NT fields. Logistic regression had an overall accuracy of 94%, BCTA 89%, and CTA 87%, but tillage was not well distinguished. Soil disturbance was estimated using linear regression (LM), regression tree analysis (RTA), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), an RTA variant. Classification of soil disturbance was best achieved using RTA (predicted mean soil disturbance not significantly different than known soil disturbance, p-value = 0.08). Classification of Landsat ETM+ imagery showed promise for predicting tillage and agricultural soil disturbance over large, heterogeneous areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Planned satellite launches will provide open access and operational L-band radar data streams at space-time resolutions not previously available. To further prepare, the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) platform was used to observe cropland sites across the southern United States to support the development of L-band (24 cm) prototype science products. Time series flights flew over four independent areas during the growing season of 2019 while crop ground measurements were collected. Major crops include corn, cotton, pasture, peanut, rice, and soybean. A suite of cropland classification experiments applied a set of machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest, feedforward fully connected neural network, support vector machine), the recently developed Multi-temporal Binary Tree Classification (MBTC), and a phenology (Coefficient of Variation; CoV) approach to synergistically assess performance, scattering mechanisms, and limitations. Specific objectives of this research application included 1.) evaluation of L-band mapping performance across multiple independent agricultural production areas with field scale training data, and 2.) assessment of the CoV approach for the generation of prototype NISAR Level 2 science products. Collectively, SAR terms with sensitivity to volume scattering performed well and consistently across CoV mapping experiments achieving accuracy greater than 80% for cropland vs not cropland. Dynamic phenology classes, such as herbaceous wetlands, had some confusion with CoV agriculture requiring further regionalized training optimization. Volume scattering and cross-pol terms were most useful across the different ML techniques with overall accuracy and Kappa consistently over 90% and 0.85, respectively, for crop type by late growth stages for L-band observations. As expected, time series information was more valuable compared to any single ML technique, site, or crop schema. Ultimately, as more SAR platforms launch, the user community should leverage physical contributions of different wavelengths and polarizations along with growing open access time series for efficient and meaningful agricultural products.

   Monitoring
AB A new multiple kernel learning (MKL) framework is presented for classification of satellite remotely sensed time series for agricultural analysis. In this MKL framework, a new composite kernel is constructed with a weighted sum of some predefined kernels. The problem of proper estimation of weights is modeled as an optimization problem of maximizing the kernel alignment between composite kernel and an ideal kernel. Two heuristics and genetic algorithm are used to solve this optimization problem. The proposed MKL framework is tested with SVM algorithm using a time series of Soil Adjusted Vegetation index data for mapping of five crops. The results obtained from the MKL method showed higher performances in comparison with the SVM trained with a single kernel.

TI Extraction of training samples from time-series MODIS imagery and its
   utility for land cover classification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB A number of classification techniques to generate land cover maps from satellite imagery have been proposed but supervised classification with manual selection and delineation of training samples (TSs) continues to be the preferred technique. The current practices of field visits and manual delineation of TSs by visual recognition are highly demanding on both resources and time, with limited utility. With an increase in the number of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) platforms and the enormous data that they generate, there is a need to process the data quickly and efficiently for creating global science products. Towards this goal, an attempt has been made in this article to develop a method for the automatic extraction of the TSs from the time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS - 250 m) vegetation index (VI), which can then be used for supervised classification to create a land cover map with any classification technique on relevant remotely sensed data. The TSs contained 1.27%, 0.09% and 1.18% of the total pixels for the forest, crop and water classes of the study region. Validation with AdvancedWide Field Sensor (AWiFS - 56 m)-derived national land use/land cover (LULC) map of India shows a complete agreement with the location of what can be considered as pure class pixels. The article also demonstrates and compares the utility of these TSs with an expert choice of TSs on MODIS time-series data using k-nearest neighbour, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and on a single-scene Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor-3 (LISS-3 - 24 m) imagery using maximum likelihood (ML) classifier.

AB Monitoring the expansion of commodity crops in the tropics is crucial to safeguard forests for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is one such crop that is a major driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia. We evaluated the use of a semi-automated approach with random forest as a classifier and combined optical and radar datasets to classify oil palm land-cover in 2015 in Sumatra, Indonesia, using Google Earth Engine. We compared our map with two existing remotely-sensed oil palm land-cover products that utilized visual and semi-automated approaches for the same year. We evaluated the accuracy of oil palm land-cover classification from optical (Landsat), radar (synthetic aperture radar (SAR)), and combined optical and radar satellite imagery (Combined). Combining Landsat and SAR data resulted in the highest overall classification accuracy (84%) and highest producer's and user's accuracy for oil palm classification (84% and 90%, respectively). The amount of oil palm land-cover in our Combined map was closer to official government statistics than the two existing land-cover products that used visual interpretation techniques. Our analysis of the extents of disagreement in oil palm land-cover indicated that our map had comparable accuracy to one of them and higher accuracy than the other. Our results demonstrate that a combination of optical and radar data outperforms the use of optical-only or radar-only datasets for oil palm classification and that our technique of preprocessing and classifying combined optical and radar data in the Google Earth Engine can be applied to accurately monitor oil-palm land-cover in Southeast Asia.

AB Mapping crop types is of great importance for assessing agricultural production, land-use patterns, and the environmental effects of agriculture. Indeed, both radiometric and spatial resolution of Landsat's sensors images are optimized for cropland monitoring. However, accurate mapping of crop types requires frequent cloud-free images during the growing season, which are often not available, and this raises the question of whether Landsat data can be combined with data from other satellites. Here, our goal is to evaluate to what degree fusing Landsat with MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data can improve crop-type classification. Choosing either one or two images from all cloud-free Landsat observations available for the Arlington Agricultural Research Station area in Wisconsin from 2010 to 2014, we generated 87 combinations of images, and used each combination as input into the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm to predict Landsat-like images at the nominal dates of each 8-day MODIS NBAR product. Both the original Landsat and STARFM-predicted images were then classified with a support vector machine (SVM), and we compared the classification errors of three scenarios: 1) classifying the one or two original Landsat images of each combination only, 2) classifying the one or two original Landsat images plus all STARFM-predicted images, and 3) classifying the one or two original Landsat images together with STARFM-predicted images for key dates. Our results indicated that using two Landsat images as the input of STARFM did not significantly improve the STARFM predictions compared to using only one, and predictions using Landsat images between July and August as input were most accurate. Including all STARFM-predicted images together with the Landsat images significantly increased average classification error by 4% points (from 21% to 25%) compared to using only Landsat images. However, incorporating only STARFM-predicted images for key dates decreased average classification error by 2% points (from 21% to 19%) compared to using only Landsat images. In particular, if only a single Landsat image was available, adding STARFM predictions for key dates significantly decreased the average classification error by 4 percentage points from 30% to 26% (p < 0.05). We conclude that adding STARFM-predicted images can be effective for improving crop-type classification when only limited Landsat observations are available, but carefully selecting images from a full set of STARFM predictions is crucial. We developed an approach to identify the optimal subsets of all STARFM predictions, which gives an alternative method of feature selection for future research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose an improved methodology for calculating indicator 2.4.1 "Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture" within the ERA-PLANET Horizon 2020 project "The European Network for Observing our Changing Planet". The main improvements are in using accurate 10 m resolution crop classification map and Leaf Area Index derived from satellite data and WOFOST biophysical model. Based on proposed methodology indicator 2.4.1 has been calculated for the territory of Ukraine.

We tested both pixel-based with minimum distance (MD) and maximum likelihood (MLC) and object-based with Random Forest (RF) algorithm for this task. Training samples and verification data were selected by visual interpreting the WV2 images for seven thematic classes: fully grown, middle stage, and early stage of avocado crops, bare land, two types of natural forests, and water body. To examine the contribution of the four new spectral bands of WV2 sensor, all the tested classifications were carried out with and without the four new spectral bands Classification accuracy assessment results show that object-based classification with RF algorithm obtained higher overall higher accuracy (93.06%) than pixel-based MD (69.37%) and MLC (64.03%) method. For both pixel-based and object-based methods, the classifications with the four new spectral bands (overall accuracy obtained higher accuracy than those without: overall accuracy of object-based RF classification with vs without: 93.06% vs 83.59%, pixel-based MD: 69.37% vs 67.2%, pixel-based MLC: 64.03% vs 36.05%, suggesting that the four new spectral bands in WV2 sensor contributed to the increase of the classification accuracy.

AB Large-scale cropland changes have significant implications for global and national food supply as well as degradation in land resources. We examined cropland dynamics at the national scale in Mongolia over the last three decades using Google Earth Engine cloud computing and 11,360 Landsat satellite images. Our overarching goal was to develop the first comprehensive, high-resolution maps of Mongolia's cropland extent for two nominal years: 1990 at the peak of the socialist era production and 2014 after major socio-political and economic regime changes. By comparing the two cropland maps, we estimate cropland changes and identify areas of post-socialist cropland abandonment. Our cropland classifications produce high overall accuracies (overall weighted, statistical accuracies of 98% and 97%, respectively), and the cropland area estimates compare well with county-level crop area statistics (R-2=0.91, p value <.001). We estimate 38% cropland decline in Mongolia throughout the major crop regions but 18% increase in the central region due to increased concentration of crop production. The observed large-scale cropland abandonment would be expected to result in substantial land conversion to rangelands as well as land degradation in the abandoned fields, including soil erosion, increased contribution to desertification, and reduced species diversity. Future studies can monitor the long-term trajectory in the abandoned crop fields and recommend targeted restoration strategies.

AB Rice and wheat are very important grain crops and are heavily grown in lands between the Ravi and Chenab Rivers in Pakistan. Because rice is generally cultivated under standing water conditions, careful estimation of actual water consumption and crop water productivity (CWP) is key for proper water management. In the current study, an effort is made to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) by using the soil and energy balance algorithm (SEBAL), which used the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite with a spatial resolution of 1,000 m. Rice and wheat crop dominance areas were identified by using the ISODATA crop classification technique by utilizing MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) 250 m resolution data. Crop-specific ETa was masked out both for rice and wheat, and this information was utilized with crop yield for estimation of CWP. Tehsil administrative-level crop-yield data were collected and extrapolated to model crop yield on a pixel basis by benefiting from crop yields and specific NDVI empirical relationships. Study results showed a variation of ETa (402-780 and 244-328 mm), yield (823-2,596 and 1,287-3,646 kg/ha), and CWP (0.14-0.56 and 0.54-1.44 kg/m(3)) for rice and wheat, respectively. Best results were attained for rice in tehsil Hafizabad with a coefficient of variation in CWP of 7.94%. Most of the other tehsils showed higher variability of approximately 16%. The primary cause of lower CWP for rice crop in these tehsils is higher values of ETa (i.e., greater than 600 mm), which is ideal for maximizing CWP in the study region. For the wheat crop, because water consumption is almost similar in all parts and CWP is primarily variable owing to yield differences, this suggested minimum scope for CWP improvement by water management for wheat. Crop cultivation expenditures can be reduced both for rice and wheat by proper application and management of water and fertilizer. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Drought is an insidious hazard of nature and is considered to be the most complex but least understood of all natural hazards. Large historical datasets are required to study drought and these involve complex interrelationships between climatological and meteorological data. Rainfall is an important meteorological parameter; the amount and distribution influence the type of vegetation in a region. To analyse the changes in vegetation cover due to variation in rainfall and identify the land-use areas facing drought risk, rainfall data from 1981 to 2003 were categorized into excess, normal, deficit and drought years. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor's composite dataset was used for analysing the temporal and interannual behaviour of surface vegetation. The various land-use classes - crop land (annual, perennial crops), scrub land, barren land, forest land, degraded pasture and grassland - were identified using satellite data for excess, normal, deficit and drought years. Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) were derived from satellite data for each land-use class and the highest NDVI mean values were 0.515, 0.436 and 0.385 for the tapioca crop in excess, normal and deficit years, respectively, whereas in the drought year, the groundnut crop (0.267) showed the maximum. Grassland recorded the lowest value of NDVI in all years except for the excess year. Annual crops, such as groundnut (0.398), pulses (0.313), sorghum (0.120), tapioca (0.436) and horse gram (0.259), registered comparatively higher NDVI values than the perennial crops for the normal year. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) was used to estimate vegetation health and monitor drought. Among land-use classes, the maximum VCI value of 92.1% was observed in onions for the excess year, whereas groundnut witnessed the maximum values of 78.2, 64.5 and 55.2% for normal, deficit and drought years, respectively. Based on the VCI classification, all land-use classes fall into the optimal or normal vegetation category in excess and normal years, whereas in drought years most of the land-use classes fall into the drought category except for sorghum, groundnut, pulses and grasses. These crops (sorghum 39.7%, groundnut 55.2%, pulses 38.5% and grassland 38.6%) registered maximum VCI values, revealing that they were sustained under drought conditions. It is suggested that the existing crop pattern be modified in drought periods by selecting the suitable crops of sorghum, groundnut and pulses and avoiding the cultivation of onion, rice and tapioca.

AB Conventional approaches to training a supervised image classification aim to fully describe all of the classes spectrally. To achieve a complete description of each class in feature space, a large training set is typically required. It is not, however, always necessary to have training statistics that provide a complete and representative description of the classes, especially if using nonparametric classifiers. For classification by a support vector machine, only the training samples that are support vectors, which lie on part of the edge of the class distribution in feature space, are required; all other training samples provide no contribution to the classification analysis. If regions likely to furnish support vectors can be identified in advance of the classification, it may be possible to intelligently select useful training samples. The ability to target useful training samples may allow accurate classification from small training sets. This potential for intelligent training sample collection was explored for the classification of agricultural crops from multispectral satellite sensor data. With a conventional approach to training, only a quarter of the training samples acquired actually made a positive contribution to the analysis and allowed the crops to be classified to a high accuracy (92.5%). The majority of the training set, therefore, was unnecessary as it made no contribution to the analysis. Using ancillary information on soil type, however, it would be possible to constrain the training sample acquisition process. By limiting training sample acquisition only to regions with a specific soil type, it was possible to use a small training set to classify the data without loss of accuracy. Thus, a small number of intelligently selected training samples may be used to classify a data set as accurately as a larger training set derived in a conventional manner. The results illustrate the potential to direct training data acquisition strategies to target the most useful training samples to allow efficient and accurate image classification.

AB The Multan district is mainly prone to riverine floods but has remained understudied. Chenab flood-2014 was the worst flood that this district experienced in recorded history. This study applies remote sensing (RS) techniques to estimate the extent, calculate duration, assess the major causes and resulting impacts of the flood-2014, using Landsat-8 OLI images. These images were obtained for pre-flood, during-flood and post-flood instances. Secondary data of flood causing factors were obtained for comprehensive analysis. Spatially trained and validated datasets were obtained through Google Earth platform and Global positioning system. The supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify land use and land cover of the study area. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index was utilized to detect flood inundation extent and duration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was utilized to monitor vegetation coverage and changes. The analysis allowed us to assess flood causes, and calculate the extent of the flooded areas with duration and recession, as well as damages to standing crops and built-up areas. The results revealed that the flood-2014 occurred due to heavy rains in early September in upper Chenab catchment. The flood inundation continued for around two months, which heavily affected agriculture and built-up areas. The present study introduces practical use of RS techniques to provide basis for effective flood inundation mapping and impact assessment, as an application for early flood response and recovery in the world.

AB Detecting plant health condition is an important step in controlling disease and insect stress in agricultural crops. In this study, we applied neural network and principal components analysis techniques for discriminating and classifying different fungal infection levels in rice (Oryza sativa L) panicles. Four infection levels in rice panicles were used in the study: no infection condition, light and moderate infection caused by rice glume blight disease, and serious infection caused by rice false smut disease. Hyperspectral reflectance of rice panicles was measured through the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm with a portable spectroradiometer in the laboratory. The spectral response characteristics of rice panicles were analyzed, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to obtain the principal components (PCs) derived from different spectra processing methods, namely raw, inverse logarithmic, first, and second derivative reflectance. A learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network classifier was employed to classify healthy, light, moderate, and serious infection levels. Classification accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The overall accuracies of LVQ with PCA derived from the raw, inverse logarithmic, first, and second derivative reflectance spectra for the validation dataset were 91.6%, 86.4%, 95.5%, and 100% respectively, and the corresponding Kappa coefficients were 0.887, 0.818, 0.939 and 1. Our results indicated that it is possible to discriminate different fungal infection levels of rice panicles under laboratory conditions using hyperspectral remote sensing data.

AB It is quite challenging to assess the crop water requirement with limited time and resources on a regional scale. The study focuses on developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for crop water requirement and to determine the efficacy of existing irrigation systems by utilizing advanced geo-spatial techniques. Selected region was Punjab province of Pakistan that covers a total area of 105227 sq.km . Reflectance based crop coefficient approach was used forcrop water requirement estimation. Various metrological, climatic, geographical vector layers and statistical data of irrigation supply along with satellite imageries were used for monitoring the crop health on 8-days periodic intervals for the summer (Khalif) season in the year 2018. For accurate quantification and mapping of crop water requirement, Landsat, MODIS and SPOT imageries were processed for crop classification, top of the atmosphere radiation calculation and actual and reference measurements, respectively. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated using Penman method leading to provide water demand and consumption by further calculations in each irrigation circle. The results show that the regions lying at the tail of the canal command area (CCA) facing higher water deficit. In addition, irrigation circles facing insufficient irrigation water supplies (upper and lower Jhelum canal, Pothoar region) also demonstrating higher crop water deficits. Comparing southern with northern parts of the province high water deficits observed in images in the year 2018, reflecting these regions are relatively hotter and receive less average precipitation. Similarly, high water deficit observed at northeast of the Punjab due to insufficient irrigation water supply. The results have been validated by comparing the water demand with the irrigation supply in each CCA, which provides the water being utilized other than irrigation sources to satisfy crop water needs. This study is quite effective in water budget estimation and mitigation of water scarcity issues.

AB Increasing drought occurrences and growing populations demand accurate, routine, and consistent cultivated and fallow cropland products to enable water and food security analysis. The overarching goal of this research was to develop and test automated cropland classification algorithm (ACCA) that provide accurate, consistent, and repeatable information on seasonal cultivated as well as seasonal fallow cropland extents and areas based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer remote sensing data. Seasonal ACCA development process involves writing series of iterative decision tree codes to separate cultivated and fallow croplands from noncroplands, aiming to accurately mirror reliable reference data sources. A pixel-by-pixel accuracy assessment when compared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland data showed, on average, a producer's accuracy of 93% and a user's accuracy of 85% across all months. Further, ACCA-derived cropland maps agreed well with the USDA Farm Service Agency crop acreage-reported data for both cultivated and fallow croplands with R-square values over 0.7 and field surveys with an accuracy of >= 95% for cultivated croplands and >= 76% for fallow croplands. Our results demonstrated the ability of ACCA to generate cropland products, such as cultivated and fallow cropland extents and areas, accurately, automatically, and repeatedly throughout the growing season.

AB Agricultural residues are materials left over from the production of crops, which include the straw of rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, and cereal straws etc. A mass of agricultural residues are burnt directly in the field in China every year. The burning of straw produces an amount of carbon dioxide and smoke, which concerns over the adverse health and environment effect. In recent years, Remote Sensing data were widely used to monitoring the burning of agricultural residues. Based on the improved fire detection algorithm proposed by the MODIS fire team, this paper presents an automatic inversion model to monitoring the straw burning, which is especially aimed at the regions in China. The model uses several bands of MODIS 113 data, which include the 1-km resolution 4- and 11-mu m channels, the 500-m resolution 2.1-mu m band, and the 250-m resolution red and near-infrared channels. In addition, some geographic data, including administration boundary data, land classification data and population density data, are necessary to getting statistical information about the straw burning. The final results of the model are fire monitoring product that includes the fire pixel location data of the straw burning, and the statistical information that includes affected area and affected population by the agricultural residues burning in every province. The valuable information will provide effective decision support for Chinese administration to. preventing the straw burning.

AB In this study, a great variation in crop yield, which affects the socio-economic and physical environment of the area, is observed along the irrigation channels in Pakistan. This is mainly due to inequitable distribution of canal water causing spatial variations along the system. Assessing the performance of irrigation system can help to find any disparity which should be rectified to achieve the desired objectives of irrigation. Due to lack of real-time data, performance of an irrigation system cannot be readily determined particularly in developing countries. Remote sensing and geographic information system are the best tools to overcome this difficulty. Normalized difference vegetation index indirectly indicates the presence of water in plants. Biomass production and evapotranspiration are crucial indicators for describing the spatial variation of irrigation water. In this study, infrared bands of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer sensor were used to determine surface temperatures and various components of the energy balance equation. The spatial disparity in evapotranspiration was found from head to tail of the system. Classification of evapotranspiration into different groups revealed that the area under higher evapotranspiration range is more at the head of the system than its tail, which indicates that more canal water is supplied at the head of the system. These results clearly testify the disparity of canal water distribution along the system leading to reduced income and environmental degradation of the downstream water users.

DE greenhouse; GIS; texture; accuracy assessment
AB Actual research challenges in automated recognition of crop shelters regard, among other issues, the accuracy of classification, contour detection and typology identification. In this field the use of high-resolution multispectral images has been found to improve the feature recognition in comparison to RGB images or low resolution multispectral ones.
   As for classification methodologies, per-pixel and object-oriented ones offer different tools to cope with image recognition and feature extraction.
   In this study, to improve the classification of cropshelter coverage, the per-pixel method was applied to high-resolution multispectral images, coupled with a texture analysis of high-resolution panchromatic images. In detail, the results of the classification accuracy assessment achieved by the use of native high-resolution panchromatic images and RGB-band images resampled accordingly, were compared with those found in a previous study in which panchromatic images degraded to the RGB-band image resolution were used.
   The results show that the proposed methodology is suitable to improve crop-shelter classification quality and contour detection of parcels.

AB The precipitation influence in the vegetation vigor and the area covered by water in the southwestern of the Buenos Aires province (Argentina) was evaluated using geotechnologies. The rainfall records were analyzed statistically for a period of 30 years in order to obtain normal maps and anomalies and classification of years depending on rainfall. The vegetation temporal changes were obtained from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. The water coverage variation was evaluated by unsupervised classification of satellite images. In both cases, the study period was 2004-2009.
   As a result, open shrub cover was more stable against the rainfall variability while the coverage of crops was the most sensitive. Meanwhile, the coverage of grasslands showed greater sensitivity to other climatic variables such as temperature. We found a positive correlation between the area covered by water and the annual precipitation. The variation in the areal extension was of 30% when comparing a wet period (2004) with dry one (2009).

AB In this article, we investigate several structured deep learning models for crop type classification on multi-spectral time series. In particular, our aim is to assess the respective importance of spatial and temporal structures in such data. With this objective, we consider several designs of convolutional, recurrent, and hybrid neural networks, and assess their performance on a large dataset of freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. We find that the best-performing approaches are hybrid configurations for which most of the parameters (up to 90%) are allocated to modeling the temporal structure of the data. Our results thus constitute a set of guidelines for the design of bespoke deep learning models for crop type classification.

DE remote sensing; precision farming; soil mapping
AB Soil maps derived from random or grid-based sampling schemes are often an important part of precision crop management. Sampling and soil analysis to derive such maps require a large investment of both time and money. Aerial photos have been used as a soil mapping aid for years. Studies have shown such an approach can be useful for defining management units in precision farming, but these studies are often limited to a single field, not an entire farming operation. In this study, multispectral airborne [green, red, near infrared (NIR), and thermal] and satellite (SPOT and Landsat TM) data were used to derive soil textural class maps for 350 ha of a 770 ha research and demonstration farm in Maricopa, Arizona. These maps were compared to soil textural analysis results from samples in the top 30 cm of the soil profile at an approximate grid spacing of 120 m. Differences in tillage, residue, soil moisture, etc. between fields limited the accuracy of spectral classification procedures when applied across the entire study area. However, using spectral classification procedures on a field-by-field basis, it was possible to map areas of soil textural class with reasonable accuracy. These results are specific to the study area and may not apply at other locations due to the numerous factors that can contribute to a soil's spectral response. Classification procedures were also used with vegetation present over the study area later in the season. Resulting vegetation classes may be helpful in deciding if soil classes impact crop development enough to warrant different management practices.

AB A global increase in average annual temperatures above land and oceans has led to increasing sea levels, which has in turn caused flooding along the coastlines of the Kerkennah Islands, Sfax Governorate, Central-East Tunisia. Seawater actively seeps into the groundwater of these islands. This groundwater is used for crop irrigation, which has resulted in rapid salinization and degradation of the soil cover. Thus, the environment in the Kerkennah Islands is characterized by hypersaline soil that is densely populated by halophytes. The halophyte distribution can be studied by mapping and monitoring using a remote sensing approach. In this work, we focused on determining the normalized difference vegetation index, the automated water extraction index, and the salinity index (NDVI, AWEI, and SI, respectively) in images obtained by Landsat 8 in order to map the soil salinity and halophyte cover in this region using the QGIS, GDAL, and SAGA GIS software packages. To achieve accurate land cover mapping of the Kerkennah Islands, we devised a scheme for identifying halophytes according to a decision tree based on a spectral classification approach that exploits several spectral indices. A regression model was used to detect significant relationships between spectral indices and soil characteristics such as pH and EC. The dynamics of the soil salinity in the study region were estimated using SI9, as this approach is known to give accurate results. The results confirm the methodology for mapping salinity by halophytes.

AB Fuzzy excess red (ExR) and excess green (ExG) indices and clustering algorithms: fuzzy c-means (FCM) and Gustafson-Kessel (GK) were studied for unsupervised classification of hidden and prominent regions of interest (ROI) in color images. Images included sunflower, redroot pigweed, soybean, and velvet leaf plants, against bare clay soil, corn residue and wheat residue, typical of the Great Plains. Indices and clusters were enhanced with Zadeh's (Z) fuzzy intensification technique. Enhanced ROIs were sorted by degree of fuzziness, and recombined into labeled, false-color class images. ROIs with the lowest degree of fuzziness were consistently found to be plant clusters with some of the methods. The ZExG index only classified plant ROIs correctly at 76% (newly emerged) and 74% (young plants) for soil backgrounds, 55-65% for corn residue, and only 12% for young plants with wheat straw. The ZExR index failed for almost all categories, except bare soil. The ZFCM clustering algorithm correctly classified plants from 10 to 69% in bare soil, but failed for plants in corn and wheat residue. The ZGK algorithm classified plants from 16 to 96% in bare soil, and corn residue plants as high as 95%, and wheat straw plants as high as 99%, depending on age category and the relative pixel area of plants within the image. The ZGK algorithm could be potentially useful for remote sensing, mapping, crop management, weed, and pest control for precision agriculture. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Swidden agriculture, or the continuing agricultural system in which clearings are cropped for shorter periods than they are fallowed, landscapes have been described as 'difficult-to-map' because they host a high variety of land-cover types. Consequently, satellite-borne remotely sensed data have not proven overwhelmingly successful in detecting and measuring change within these landscapes. We utilize data derived from an optical sensor carried on-board an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to measure the change on a swidden agriculture plot over a 4 month period in Guyana. UAVs were built with indigenous farmers who were trained in their operation to collect data over the swidden plot. A two-class classification was developed to quantify the change in both cultivated and naturally occurring vegetation. We found that non-vegetation surfaces rapidly decreased over the 4 months, declining from 79.42% in June to 69.69% in September. Vegetation recolonization of the swidden crop was particularly the cassava crop planted by the Makushi farmer. While our analysis was completed over a single swidden plot, our work demonstrated that UAVs could play a role in mapping swidden landscapes and change the perception that they are difficult to map. Local people involvement was critical to mapping their landscapes.

ID RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION
AB In India, agribusiness is directly dependent on the precise monitoring of paddy areas to take considerable supportive actions toward food security. For this, satellite-based data is considered one of the effective solutions. The goal of this study is to design an intelligent framework to determine the crop area by using satellite data that is easily available. In this article, a Multi-resolution Deep Neural Network (MR-DNN) is proposed to determine rice fields by performing multi-streaming classification. The task of prediction is performed on Landsat 8 satellite images with high spatial resolution. The prediction performance of the proposed model is justified by comparing the calculated outcomes from a few selected methods. The proposed model has achieved the highest prediction performance in terms of the F1 score with the accuracy of 95.40% and 95.12% for Punjab and West-Bengal dataset as compared to the selected models, such as DeepLabV3+, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Light-Gradient Boosting Method (LGBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Spectral, and Threshold. In this manner, the empirical evaluation defines the prediction performance of the proposed model over the visual interpretation of the maps as well as seasonal impacts.

AB Spot satellite data were used to detect and map muskox habitat on Devon Island, N.W.T. Muskox habitat in the Canadian High Arctic is restricted to small islands of productive sedge meadow isolated within a matrix of sparsely vegetated polar desert.  On Devon Island, muskox herds move among small lowlands on the northeast coast adjacent to Jones Sound in response to the seasonal availability of sedge-dominated habitat.  Comparisons between the enhanced satellite images and species composition, plant cover, and standing crop on these lowlands showed that sedge meadows were spectrally distinct from the dwarf shrub/heath and cushion plant/lichen-moss cover types on beach ridges and rock outcrops, indicating that spectral data can be used to identify critical forage habitat for muskoxen in the High Arctic.  The hummocky sedge/moss meadow and the less productive frost boil sedge/moss meadow types could be separated from each other on the enhanced imagery.  The satellite data were simplified using a supervised classification to document the type and areal cover of muskox habitat along the northeast coast of Devon Island.  The spatially isolated hummocky sedge/moss and frost boil sedge/moss meadows occupied only 3% (16.73 km2) and 6% (32.84 km2) respectively of a total land area of 549.38 km2.

AB Although farmland birds are used extensively in Europe as an indicator group to assess agricultural impacts on ecosystems, no such group has been formally identified in North America. Here we present a hierarchical framework to identify a suite of farmland bird species in Ontario, Canada by consolidating and validating classifications derived from literature review and empirical modelling. First, we reviewed literature to compile candidate farmland bird species in Ontario and assigned species to four guilds (row crop specialists, pasture specialists, farmstead specialists, and farmland edge generalists). Second, we used regression trees (RTs) to test whether these species could be classified into the same literature-based guilds or different guilds, based on modelled relationships between breeding bird atlas abundance data and Census of Agriculture statistics. We consolidated both classifications using a decision tree into a final list of 45 farmland bird species, comprising 11 farmstead specialists, 13 pasture specialists, 5 row crop specialists, 12 farmland edge generalists, and 4 farmland generalists flagged for classification uncertainty. To validate the distinctness of the assigned farmland bird guilds, we used pairwise permANOVA to test for differences in species composition among guilds, based on 34 species with sufficient occurrence data. We found significant compositional differences between almost all guilds, except for the farmstead specialist and row crop specialist guilds which could not be differentiated. We also validated species' guild assignments using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to group 35 species according to ecological resemblance which were then compared to our proposed guild classifications. CAP validated guild assignments for 78.2% of the evaluated farmland specialists, particularly for farmstead specialists and pasture specialists, while 50% of evaluated farmland edge generalists were grouped differently than our final classification. Each final classification was associated with low, moderate, or high uncertainty according to concordance between classification methods and support from CAP groupings to highlight species with uncertainly assigned guilds. For some such species, mismatches between their literature-based and empirically-derived classifications might be due to the predictor variables being measured at too large a scale to reflect associations between their abundance distributions and agricultural landscape characteristics. We recommend that these farmland bird species be further verified using statistical models of bird count data, satellite imagery, and climate variables, and a trait-based approach to bolster confidence in the proposed list. When confirmed and expanded, this list can be used to inform a farmland bird indicator to monitor agroecosystem health in Ontario, and perhaps elsewhere in eastern North America.

AB The provision of ecosystem services at the landscape level can be significantly influenced by land management practices. Within an agriculturally dominated case study area in Saxony, Germany, a more detailed land use classification, which includes differentiated information on agricultural management practices, was utilized within the raster-based planning support tool GISCAME. "Management" refers to typical, regional crop rotations and soil tillage practices.
   The focus of this research was based on an indicator-based approach to assess ecosystem services and the development of land use change (LUC) and land management change (LMC) scenarios. The EuroMaps Land Cover data set was specifically developed for the case study and included remote sensing information for the general land use classification and terrestrial mapping information. Furthermore, statistical data on detailed regional agricultural land management were included. The raster-based planning support tool GISCAME was then used to simulate scenarios and visualize results. The LUC and LMC scenarios showed that the more detailed land use classification provided better output for the prioritization of planning alternatives. Further it enabled a refined assessment of the provisioning services (i) food and fodder provision, (ii) biomass provision, the regulation services, (iii) soil erosion protection, (iv) drought risk regulation, (v) flood regulation, (vi) returns from land-based production (i.e. the market value of biomass provision), and (vii) ecological integrity. The results of this study support the view that the application of improved management measures, such as conservation tillage, can significantly enhance the provision of ecosystem services (e.g. soil erosion protection and drought risk regulation) at the landscape level. The study also indicates that a combination of strategic LUC, such as afforestation and LMC, might be an effective way to enhance regulating services with acceptable trade-offs regarding provisioning services. Our approach presents a refined foundation for ecosystem services assessment, which is designed to better support regional planning and the provision of information to non-experts in the participatory processes. For transfer into other regions, standardized land use and land management classification will have to be defined. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The southern region is responsable for 70% of rice production in Brazil. In this study, rice areas of Rio Grande do Sul were selected, using the land use classification, scale 1: 100,000, provided by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). MODIS Images were used and meteorological data, available by National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). The period of analysis was crop season 2011/2012, october to march. To obtain evapotranspiration was applied agrometeorological-spectral model SAFER (Simple Algorithm For Retrieving Evapotranspiration). From the analysis of the results, on planting and cultivation period, the average evapotranspiration (ET) daily was 1.93 +/- 0.96 mm. day-1. In the vegetative development period of rice, the daily ET has achieved 4.94 mm. day-1, with average value 2,31 +/- 0.97 mm. day-1. In the period of harvest, evapotranspiration daily average was 1.84 +/- 0.80 mm. day-1. From results obtained, the estimation of evapotranspiration from satellite images may assist in monitoring the culture during the cycle, assisting in estimates of water productivity and crop yield.

AB Farm detection using low resolution satellite images is an important topic in digital agriculture. However, it has not received enough attention compared to high-resolution images. Although high resolution images are more efficient for detection of land cover components, the analysis of low-resolution images are yet important due to the low-resolution repositories of the past satellite images used for timeseries analysis, free availability and economic concerns. The current paper addresses the problem of farm detection using low resolution satellite images. In digital agriculture, farm detection has significant role for key applications such as crop yield monitoring. Two main categories of object detection strategies are studied and compared in this paper; First, a two-step semi-supervised methodology is developed using traditional manual feature extraction and modelling techniques; the developed methodology uses the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), 2-D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and morphological features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifier modelling. In the second strategy, high-level features learnt from the massive filter banks of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilised. Transfer learning strategies are employed for pretrained Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG-16) networks. Results show the superiority of the high-level features for classification of farm regions.

AB Land use changes are the land conversions from one type to another that alter the earth surface to satisfy mankind's immediate demand. Land use change detection using satellite imageries has emerged important mean to gather information on regional scale changes. Present study envisaged the spatio-temporal land use land cover changes of Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh using LANDSAT imageries of 1989 and 2016. The results were verified through the secondary data as well as primary data collected by detailed survey of the Kullu valley (Kullu and Naggar blocks) and drivers for such changes were also identified. The studies were carried out for major land use type, viz. agriculture, orchard, forest and built up in the valley over a period of 27 years. Supervised classification was done using Maximum Likelihood Classification Algorithm through ERDAS Imagine 14 software. The results indicated that during last 27 years, the built up area has increased to the extent of 90.81% followed by orchards (12.39%) and forest (6.26%), whereas area under agriculture was decreased by 56.88%. The primary data revealed that farmers are abandoning the wheat, paddy, maize and barley crops and are pursuing cultivation of vegetable and fruit crops. Increased economic returns and climate change emerged as the probable drivers for the changes in the valley.

AB Among the difficulties and uncertainties that arise when determining water balance is the calculation of groundwater abstraction. This factor is particularly important in aquifers whose extension and heavy agricultural use make direct quantification methods unfeasible (i.e. flow meters and power consumption data). This study presents a method of quantifying groundwater abstractions for irrigation based on the analysis of multitemporal and multispectral satellite images. The process begins with a highly detailed classification of irrigated crops; these data are entered in a Geographic Information System, overlain with a correct estimate of the irrigation requirements of the crop, and corrected in accordance with the agricultural practices of the area. The results reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of the groundwater volume abstracted and used for agriculture. This methodology has been applied in the Mancha Oriental Hydrogeological System (Spain, 7,260 km(2)), where abstractions for agriculture comprise more than 90% of the hydrological resources consumed. In this context, accuracies of over 95% have been obtained with a cost sixty times lower than that of traditional methods.

AB Wheat is cultivated on more than 2.7 million hectares in Afghanistan annually, yet the country is dependent on imports to meet domestic demand. The timely estimation of domestic wheat production is highly critical to address any potential food security issues and has been identified as a priority by the Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL). In this study, we developed a system for in-season mapping of wheat crop area based on both optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR, Sentinel-1) data to support estimation of wheat cultivated area for management and food security planning. Utilizing a 2010 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) cropland mask, wheat sown area for 2017 was mapped integrating decision trees and machine learning algorithms in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Information from provincial crop calendars in addition to training and validation data from field-based surveys, and high-resolution Digitalglobe and Airbus Pleiades images were used for classification and validation. The total irrigated and rainfed wheat area were estimated as 912,525 and 562,611 ha, respectively for 2017. Province-wise accuracy assessments show the maximum accuracy of irrigated (IR) and rainfed (RF) wheat across provinces was 98.76 and 99%, respectively, whereas the minimum accuracy was found to be 48% (IR) and 73% (RF). The lower accuracy is attributed to the unavailability of reference data, cloud cover in the satellite images and overlap of spectral reflectance of wheat with other crops, especially in the opium poppy growing provinces. While the method is designed to provide estimation at different stages of the growing season, the best accuracy is achieved at the end of harvest using time-series satellite data for the whole season. The approach followed in the study can be used to generate wheat area maps for other years to aid in food security planning and policy decisions.

AB The use of plastic materials in agriculture involves several benefits but it results in huge quantities of agricultural plastic waste to be disposed of. Input and output data on the use of plastics in agriculture are often difficult to obtain and poor waste management schemes have been developed. The present research aims to estimate and map agricultural plastic waste by using satellite images. Waste was evaluated by means of the indexes relating waste production to crop type and plastic application as defined by the land use map realized by classifying the Landsat 8 image. The image classification was carried out using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and the accuracy assessment showed that the overall accuracy was 94.54% and the kappa coefficient equal to 0.934. Data on the plastic waste obtained by the satellite land use map were compared with the data obtained by using the institutional land use map; a difference of 1.74% was identified on the overall quantity of waste.

AB The study of spatiotemporal variations in agricultural activities in a riverine ecosystem is extremely important to understand the growth of crops during different seasons. The trend and pattern of change, help in understanding the suitability of different crops, cropping patterns practiced, and the scope of expanding agricultural activities for a better economy. In this study, the landuse land-cover (LULC) within the Brahmaputra River is categorized into different classes using unsupervised classification. The area under cropland and vegetation in the sandbars within the riverine is estimated, and the cropping pattern is analyzed on a decadal scale. Assessment of these classified maps is performed based on the overall accuracy and kappa statistics. Further, an agricultural portion in the mid sandbars of the river in the Lower Brahmaputra Valley (LBV) is considered to analyze the spatial cropping pattern as well as the expansion of cropland areas during different months in two different years. The temporal variation of the vegetation status of different classes is monitored using the Normalized Differential Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) for 2016 and 2019. Landsat MSS, Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS, IRS-1B LISS I, and IRS-P6 LISS III satellite images are used to understand the spatial and temporal variations as well as to evaluate the cropping pattern changes. On analyzing the trend of land cover changes during the period 1976-80, 1993-95, 2003-04, and 2008-11 from Sadiya to Dhubri, it is seen that the cropland area has decreased, vegetation area increased, and the sandbar area remained more or less unchanged. The average area of total sandbars within the Brahmaputra River is found to be 742002 Ha. Out of total area, 245395.75 Ha is found to be dry sandbars and 153148.23 Ha is covered under cropland and vegetation. On the contrary to the decreased cropland area, the monthly average percentage change was found to be + similar to 36% in the dominant agriculture sandbar between the years 2016 and 2019. We observed significant changes in the cropland as well as the conversion of barren sandbars into agricultural areas. The NDVI values obtained from the Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS satellite visibly indicated the change in the crop cultivation period as well as different phases of growth and shifting of cropping patterns. This study shows the potential and suitability of utilizing these vast sandbars of Brahmaputra River for various agricultural activities and improving the socio economic development of the people.

AB Recent advances in cloud-based technology has led to the rapid increase of geospatial web-based applications. The combination of GIS and cloud-based solutions is revolutionizing product development in the geospatial industry and is facilitating accessibility to a wider range of users, planners and decision makers. Accessible through an internet browser, web applications are an effective and convenient method to disseminate information in multiple formats, and they provide an interface offering interactive access to geospatial data, real-time integration and data processing, and application specific analysis tools. An example of such a web application is GeoTerraImage's monthly crop monitoring tool called GeoFarmer. This tool uses climatic data and satellite imagery processed through a complex rule-based algorithms to determine monthly climatic averages and anomalies, and most importantly the field specific crop status (i.e. is the field fallow, or is the crop emerging, or if the field has been harvested). Monthly field verification has formed a part of calibrating the growth classification outputs to further improve the accuracy of its monthly agricultural reporting. The goal of this application is to provide timely data to decision makers to assist them in field-level and regional crop growth monitoring, crop production and management, financial risk assessment and insurance, and food security applications. This web application has the unique advantage of being highly transportable to other regions, since it has been designed so it can easily be adapted to other seasonal growth response patterns, and up-scaled to regional or national coverages for operational use.

AB This paper presents a dataset of yearly land use and land cover classification maps for Mato Grosso State, Brazil, from 2001 to 2017. Mato Grosso is one of the world's fast moving agricultural frontiers. To ensure multi-year compatibility, the work uses MODIS sensor analysis-ready products and an innovative method that applies machine learning techniques to classify satellite image time series. The maps provide information about crop and pasture expansion over natural vegetation, as well as spatially explicit estimates of increases in agricultural productivity and trade-offs between crop and pasture expansion. Therefore, the dataset provides new and relevant information to understand the impact of environmental policies on the expansion of tropical agriculture in Brazil. Using such results, researchers can make informed assessments of the interplay between production and protection within Amazon, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes.

AB Accelerating crop improvement for increased yield and better adaptation to changing climatic conditions is an issue of increasing urgency in order to satisfy the ever-increasing global food demand. However, the major bottleneck is the absence of high-throughput plant phenotyping methods for rapid and cost-effective data-driven variety selection and release in plant breeding. Traditional phenotyping methods that rely on trained experts are slow, costly, labor-intensive, subjective, and often require destructive sampling. We explore ways to improve the efficiency of crop phenotyping through the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remotely sensed data in maize (Zea maysL.) varietal response to maize streak virus (MSV) disease. Twenty-five maize varieties grown in a trial with three replications were evaluated under artificial MSV inoculation. Ground scoring for MSV infection was carried out at mid-vegetative, flowering, and mid-grain filling on a scale of 1 (resistant) to 9 (susceptible). UAV-derived spectral data were acquired at these three different phenological stages in multispectral bands corresponding to Green (0.53-0.57 mu m), Red (0.64-0.68 mu m), Rededge (0.73-0.74 mu m), and Near-Infrared (0.77-0.81 mu m). The imagery captured was stitched together in Pix4Dmapper, which generates two types of multispectral orthomosaics: the NoAlpha and the transparent mosaics for each band. The NoAlpha imagery was used as input into QGIS to extract reflectance data. Six vegetation indices were derived for each variety: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), Rededge NDVI (NDVIrededge), Simple Ratio (SR), green Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen), and Rededge Chlorophyll Index (CIrededge). The Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to evaluate UAV-derived spectral and VIs with and without variable optimization. Correlations between the UAV-derived data and manual MSV scores were significant (R = 0.74-0.84). Varieties were classified into resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible with overall classification accuracies of 77.3% (Kappa = 0.64) with optimized and 68.2% (Kappa = 0.51) without optimized variables, representing an improvement of similar to 13.3% due to variable optimization. The RF model selected GNDVI, CIgreen, CIrededge, and the Red band as the most important variables for classification. Mid-vegetative was the most ideal phenological stage for accurate varietal phenotyping and discrimination using UAV-derived multispectral data with RF under artificial MSV inoculation. The results provide a rapid UAV-based remote sensing solution that offers a step-change towards data availability at high spatial (submeter) and temporal (daily/weekly) resolution in varietal analysis for quick and robust high-throughput plant phenotyping, important for timely and unbiased data-driven variety selection and release in plant breeding programs, especially as climate change accelerates.

AB The invasion by Striga in most cereal crop fields in Africa has posed a significant threat to food security and has caused substantial socioeconomic losses. Hyperspectral remote sensing is an effective means to discriminate plant species, providing possibilities to track such weed invasions and improve precision agriculture. However, essential baseline information using remotely sensed data is missing, specifically for the Striga weed in Africa. In this study, we investigated the spectral uniqueness of Striga compared to other co-occurring maize crops and weeds. We used the in-situ FieldSpec (R) Handheld 2 (TM) analytical spectral device (ASD), hyperspectral data and their respective narrow-band indices in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) and four machine learning discriminant algorithms (i.e. random forest: RF, linear discriminant analysis: LDA, gradient boosting: GB and support vector machines: SVM) to discriminate among different levels of Striga (Striga hermonthica) infestations in maize fields in western Kenya. We also tested the utility of Sentinel-2 waveband configurations to map and discriminate Striga infestation in heterogenous cereal crop fields. The in-situ hyperspectral reflectance data were resampled to the spectral waveband configurations of Sentinel-2 using published spectral response functions. We sampled and detected seven Striga infestation classes based on three flowering Striga classes (low, moderate and high) against two background endmembers (soil and a mixture of maize and other co-occurring weeds). A guided regularized random forest (GRRF) algorithm was used to select the most relevant hyperspectral wavebands and vegetation indices (VIs) as well as for the resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands for Striga infestation discrimination. The performance of the four discriminant algorithms was compared using classification accuracy assessment metrics. We were able to positively discriminate Striga from the two background endmembers i.e. soil and co-occurring vegetation (maize and co-occurring weeds) based on the few GRRF selected hyperspectral vegetation indices and the GRRF selected resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. RF outperformed all the other discriminant methods and produced the highest overall accuracy of 91% and 85%, using the hyperspectral and resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands, respectively, across the four different discriminant models tested in this study. The class with the highest detection accuracy across all the four discriminant algorithms, was the "exclusively maize and other co-occurring weeds" (>70%). The GRRF reduced the dimensionality of the hyperspectral data and selected only 9 most relevant wavebands out of 750 wavebands, 6 VIs out of 15 and 6 out of 10 resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands for discriminating among the Striga and co-occurring classes. Resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands 3 (green) and 4 (red) were the most crucial for Striga detection. The use of the most relevant hyperspectral features (i.e. wavebands and VIs) significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the overall classification accuracy and Kappa scores (+/- 5% and +/- 0.2, respectively) in all the machine learning discriminant models. Our results show the potential of hyperspectral, resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and machine learning discriminant algorithms as a tool to accurately discern Striga in heterogenous maize agro-ecological systems.

AB This paper presents the results of land use and land cover changes mapping in Negro River Watershed, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, over a period of 39 years, between 1977 and 2016. For this purpose, we used Landsat satellites series images (1977, 1985, 1996, 2003 and 2016) and Digital Image Processing (PDI) and geographic data analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The Maximum Likelihood method was chose for the supervised classification of satellite images. Based on the results of the mapping, we verified that the predominant LULC classes throughout the study period were: forest area, field and temporary culture. At first, the classes "field" and "temporary culture" began to occupy areas previously occupied by the class "forest area". In a second moment, the class " temporary culture" happened to occupy areas previously occupied by the " field" class. These changes coincided with the significant increase in soybean cultivation in the municipalities covered by the Rio Negro-RS river basin. In 2016, soybeans occupied 75,000ha, corresponding to 75.20% of the entire area occupied by temporary crops in these municipalities.

AB This paper proposes an open-boundary locally weighted dynamic time warping (OLWDTW) method using MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data for cropland recognition. The method solves the problem of flexible planting times for crops in Southeast Asia, which has sufficient thermal and water conditions. For NDVI time series starting at the beginning of the year and terminating at the end of the year, the method can separate the non-growing season cycle and growing season cycle for crops. The non-growing season cycle may provide some useful information for crop recognition, such as soil conditions. However, the shape of the growing season's NDVI time series for crops is the key to separating cropland from other land cover types because the shape contains all of the crop growth information. The principle of the OLWDTW method is to enhance the effects of the growing season cycle on the NDVI time series by adding a local weight to the growing season when comparing the similarity of time series based on the open-boundary dynamic time warping (DTW) method. Experiments with two satellite datasets located near the Khorat Plateau in the Lower Mekong Basin validate that OLWDTW effectively improves the precision of cropland recognition compared to a non-weighted open-boundary DTW method in terms of overall accuracy. The method's classification accuracy on cropland exceeds the non-weighted open-boundary DTW by 5-7%. In future studies, an open-boundary self-adaption locally weighted DTW and a more effective combination rule for different crop types should be explored for the method's best performance and highest extraction accuracy for cropland.

AB Monitoring of irrigated land cover is important for both resource managers and farmers. An operational approach is presented to use the satellite-derived surface temperature and vegetation cover in order to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated land. Using an iterative thresholding procedure to minimize within-class variance, the bilevel segmentation of surface temperature and vegetation cover was achieved for each irrigation period (Spring, Summer and Autumn). The three periodic profiles were used to define irrigation land covers from 2008-2009 to 2018-2019 in a key agricultural region of Australia. The overall accuracy of identifying farms with irrigated land cover amounted to 95.7%. Total irrigated land cover was the lowest (approximately 200,000 ha) in the 2008-2009 crop year which increased more than three-fold in 2012-2013, followed by a gradual decline in the following years. Satellite images from Landsat series (L-5, L-7 and L-8), Sentinel-2 and ASTER were found suitable for land cover classification, which is scalable from farm to regional levels. For this reason, the results are desirable for a range of stakeholders.

AB The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop models of the yield productivity for the territory of the Rostov region that it serves as one of the major sources of the yield production having the winter wheat as its main crop. The algorithm to retrieve important land surface parameter such as biomass need to be developed and validated on the basis of high-resolution scanner MSU-E data and middle-resolution scanner MSU-SK data from Russian Resourse-01 satellite. Classification procedures of MSS imagery processing are employed along with some ground-truth observations to identify the fields of the winter wheat of the "bad", "moderate" and "good" states in accordance with the common-used agrometeorological terminology. The algorithm to retrieve the biomass from satellite scanner data includes determination of vegetation indices for image pixels and estimations of biomass content using validated relationships between biomass and vegetation indices. The practical realization of this algorithm will improve the forecasting procedures of the yield production using multitemporal imagery for whole region.

AB The transformation of dry lands into irrigated fields using groundwater resources has been the key to agricultural development in a large number of countries. Particularly in arid and semiarid areas, this transformation needs to take into account the limited water resources available.
   It is therefore, necessary to increase water application efficiency by modernising irrigation systems as well as continuously monitoring the irrigated areas in order to regulate the volume of irrigation water used.
   In this paper, we present tools based on Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) and remotely sensed data combined with geographic information systems (GIS) which assist in this kind of monitoring, especially for large areas.
   The identification of crops in areas with small fields requires high spatial resolution satellite images. The classification criterion is based on the different temporal evolution of different crops. The crop development is described by means of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Crops belonging to the same class are assumed to have similar water requirements.
   We define a new concept, the hydrological management unit (HMU) which includes all the fields which use water jointly. Their spatial location is obtained from the digital rural cadaster (DRC), a vectorial map which delimits each field. The Irrigation Advisory Service of the area determines the water requirements of each crop and estimates the volume of irrigation water actually used. By introducing this information into a GIS, we can quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of water extractions. The regulation of these extractions is the key to sustainability in aquifer case studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB Feature selection and multiple classifier fusion (MCF) are effective approaches to improve land cover classification accuracy. In this study, we combined phenological metrics and the MCF method to map land cover types in Jiangsu province of China during the second crop growing season using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer time-series data. Eight phenological metrics were developed and calculated, and a MCF scheme was proposed by combining a simple majority vote and the measurement of posterior probabilities. The four base classifiers (i.e., the maximum likelihood classifier, the Mahalanobis distance classifier, the support vector machine classifier, and the neural networks classifier) and the MCF method were used in classifications using two spectral indices from the original satellite data (direct classification) and the computed metric data (metrics-based classification). Accuracy assessments indicated that the overall accuracies and kappa coefficients of the metrics-based classifications were all higher than those of direct classifications. The average overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of metrics-based classifications were 8.36% and 0.1 higher than that of direct classifications, respectively. Similarly, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of MCF generally were close to or exceeded the highest accuracy among all the base classifiers. The highest overall accuracy and kappa coefficient was achieved by classification with the MCF method based on phenological metrics (m-MCF), which were 88% and 0.85, respectively. Our results suggested that combining phenological metrics and MCF in classification is a promising method for land cover mapping in regions where strong phenological signals can be detected.

AB Explicit spatial information about crop types on smallholder farms is important for the development of local precision agriculture. However, due to highly fragmented and heterogeneous cropland landscapes, fine-scale mapping of smallholder crops, based on low- and medium-resolution satellite images and relying on a single machine learning (ML) classifier, generally fails to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper develops an ensemble ML-based framework to improve the accuracy of parcel-level smallholder crop mapping from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images. A typical smallholder agricultural area in central China covered by WorldView-2 images is selected to demonstrate our approach. This approach involves the task of distinguishing eight crop-level agricultural land use types. To this end, six widely used individual ML classifiers are evaluated. We further improved their performance by independently implementing bagging and stacking ensemble learning (EL) techniques. The results show that the bagging models improved the performance of unstable classifiers, but these improvements are limited. In contrast, the stacking models perform better, and the Stacking #2 model (overall accuracy = 83.91%, kappa = 0.812), which integrates the three best-performing individual classifiers, performs the best of all of the built models and improves the classwise accuracy of almost all of the land use types. Since classification performance can be significantly improved without adding costly data collection, stacking-ensemble mapping approaches are valuable for the spatial management of complex agricultural areas. We also demonstrate that using geometric and textural features extracted from VHSR images can improve the accuracy of parcel-level smallholder crop mapping. The proposed framework shows the great potential of combining EL technology with VHSR imagery for accurate mapping of smallholder crops, which could facilitate the development of parcel-level crop identification systems in countries dominated by smallholder agriculture.

AB Indian agriculture relies on monsoon rainfall and irrigation from surface and groundwater. The interannual variability of monsoon rainfalls is high, which forces South Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated areas to local water availability. In this study, we have developed and tested a methodology for monitoring these spatiotemporal variations using Sentinel-1 and -2 observations over the Kudaliar catchment, Telangana State (similar to 1000 km(2)). These free radar and optical data have been acquired since 2015 on a weekly basis over continental areas, at a high spatial resolution (10-20 m) that is well adapted to the small areas of South Indian field crops. A machine learning algorithm, the Random Forest method, was used over three growing seasons (January to March and July to November 2016 and January to March 2017) to classify small patches of inundated rice paddy, maize, and other irrigated crops, as well as surface water stored in the small reservoirs scattered across the landscape. The crop production comprises only irrigated crops (less than 20% of the areas) during the dry season (Rabi, December to March), to which rain-fed cotton is added to reach 60% of the areas during the monsoon season (Kharif, June to November). Sentinel-1 radar backscatter provides useful observations during the cloudy monsoon season. The lowest irrigated area totals were found during Rabi 2016 and Kharif 2016, accounting for 3.5 and 5% with moderate classification confusion. This confusion decreases with increasing areas of irrigated crops during Rabi 2017. During this season, 16% of rice and 6% of irrigated crops were detected after the exceptional rainfalls observed in September. Surface water in small surface reservoirs reached 3% of the total area, which corresponds to a high value. The use of both Sentinel datasets improves the method accuracy and strengthens our confidence in the resulting maps. This methodology shows the potential of automatically monitoring, in near real time, the high short term variability of irrigated area totals in South India, as a proxy for estimating irrigated water and groundwater needs. These are estimated over the study period to range from 49.5 +/- 0.78 mm (1.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2016, and 44.9 +/- 2.9 mm (6.5% uncertainty) in the Kharif season, to 226.2 +/- 5.8 mm (2.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2017. This variation must be related to groundwater recharge estimates that range from 10 mm to 160 mmyr(-1) in the Hyderabad region. These dynamic agro-hydrological variables estimated from Sentinel remote sensing data are crucial in calibrating runoff, aquifer recharge, water use and evapotranspiration for the spatially distributed agro-hydrological models employed to quantify the impacts of agriculture on water resources.

AB Modern agriculture is facing new challenges about food production for a growing population in a sustainable manner. Crop mapping at local and regional scale could provide valuable information in support of agricultural policy. This paper describes a field mapping investigation in a populated area in Tuscany (Italy). Satellite images from Sentinel-1 C-band and COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR and Sentinel-2 optical sensors are input of classifiers based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Results pinpointed that the use of optical images allowed the best overall classification accuracy (99.7%), nevertheless X-band SAR imagery, providing an accuracy of 94.6%, could be a good substitute of optical indices in case of lack of cloud-free multispectral data.

AB Accurate and timely information regarding the location and area of major crop types has significant economic, food, policy, and environmental implications. Both hard and soft classification methods are used throughout the growing season to generate cropland distribution maps using multiple remotely sensed data. Hard classification models (HCMs) yield good results in large homogeneous areas where pure pixels are dominant, but they fail in fragmented areas where mixed pixels are dominant. Conversely, soft classification models (SCMs) are thought to have greater accuracy in fragmented areas than in regions with pure pixels. To take advantage of both methods, we develop a hard and SCM (HSCM) based on existing HCMs and SCMs, and test it using data from simulated images as well as actual satellite data from southeast Beijing, China. The model assessment was performed using three statistical metrics at scales ranging from 1 x 1 to 10 x 10 pixels. The results reveal that the HSCM has the highest classification accuracy and produces more reasonable cropland distribution maps than those produced by either HCMs or SCMs. Moreover, the theory and methods employed in developing the HSCM provide a unifying framework for mapping land cover types, and they can be applied to different HCMs and SCMs beyond those currently in use.

AB In recent years, the problem of ravine erosion with consequent loss of usable land has received much attention worldwide. The Chambal ravine zone in India is well known for being an extremely intricate, deeply incised network of ravines in a 10 km wide zone on the flanks of the Chambal River. It occupies an area of similar to 0.5 million hectares at the expense of fertile agricultural land of the Chambal Valley. The broad grouping of the ravines considering their reclamation potential, as carried out by previous workers based on visual interpretation of optical remote sensing data, is mostly descriptive in nature. In the present study, characterization of the ravines as a function of their erosion potential expressed through ravine density, ravine depth, and ravine surface cover was made in quantitative terms exploiting the preferential characteristics of side-looking, long-wavelength, coherent SAR signal and precision measurements associated with the InSAR technique.
   The outlines of ravines appear remarkably prominent in SAR backscattered amplitude images due to the high sensitivity of the SAR signal to terrain ruggedness. Using local statistics-based meso and macro textural information of SAR backscattered amplitude images in 7 x 7 pixel windows (the pixel size being 20 m x 20 m), the ravine-affected area has been classified into three density classes, namely low, moderate, and high density ravine classes.
   C-band InSAR digital elevation models (DEMs) of sparsely vegetated ravine areas essentially give the terrain height. From the pixel-by-pixel terrain height, the ravine depth was calculated by differencing the maximum and minimum terrain heights of the pixels in a 100 m distance range. Considering the vertical precision of the ERS InSAR DEMs of similar to 5 m and ravine depth classification by previous workers [Sharma, H.S., 1968. Genesis and pattern of ravines of the Lower Chambal Valley, India. Special Issue. 21st International Geographical Union Congress 30(4), 14-24; Seth, S.P., Bhatnagar, R.K., Chauhan, S.S., 1969. Reclamability classification and nature of ravines of Chambal Command Areas. Journal of Soil and Water Conservation in India 17 (3-4), 39-44.], three depth classes, namely shallow (<5 m), moderately deep (5-20 m), and deep (>20 m) ravines, were made.
   Using the temporal decorrelation property of the close time interval InSAR data pair, namely the ERS SAR tandem pair, four ravine surface cover classes, namely barren land, grass/scrub/crop land, sparse vegetation, and wet land/dense vegetation, could be delineated, which was corroborated by the spectral signatures in the optical range and selective ground truths.

AB Field-based classifications of multispectral SPOT 4, SPOT 5, IKONOS, QuickBird and the pansharpaned (PS) QuickBird images were performed for an agricultural land located near the 'Karacabey Plain' of Turkey. The main objectives were to evaluate the classification accuracies and to find out the effects of filtering on the accuracies of different resolution images for agricultural crop mapping. To fulfill these objectives, first, a Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) was performed on each satellite image in a per-pixel manner. Second, for each agricultural field, the frequencies of the classified pixels were computed and the majority class was assigned to each parcel as the class label. In order to see the differences between all bands (blue, green, red, near-infrared, and shortwave near-infrared), common bands (green, red, near-infrared), and filtered bands, the images were analysed using different number of bands. Then, the confusion matrices were computed to get the accuracies of the results. Of the images used, the IKONOS XS, QuickBird XS, and QuickBird PS images provided relatively higher overall accuracies (about 85%) than the other images. On the other hand, for the SPOT4 XS image, the lowest accuracies of around 75% were computed.

AB The Three Gorges Area (TGA), along the Yangtze River, China has been experiencing drastic land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes since the commencement of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in 1994. These changes may have environmental impacts. However, information about the changes is limited and difficult to obtain. In this paper, optical satellite imagery is used to detect LU/LC changes during the study period 1987-2006 for the complicated, high-relief environment. A case study was conducted in Zigui County of Hubei Province within the TGA. A site-specific procedure using a decision rule-based classification method and a post classification change detection technique is developed to combine spectral and spatial knowledge in the classification of multi-temporal images. Using the decision rule-based classification method, overall accuracies of LU/LC maps of seven classes between 73.4% and 89.5% were obtained, increased by 4-5% over that using the traditional method. The results show that the main trend in LU/LC change in the study area throughout the monitoring period was a steady reduction in natural vegetation areas. About 32% of the total area of natural vegetation, including forest, shrub and grass, was lost to built up areas, crop fields and orchards.

AB It is very challenging to extract tea plantations from medium-resolution satellite imageries. This paper presents a new methodological framework based on the random forest classifier for extracting tea plantations from Landsat-8 OLI imageries. Analysis is facilitated by a dataset of three Landsat-8 OLI images (spring, autumn and winter) in 2014 covering the Anji County, one of the major tea production regions in China. More specifically, in order to determine the relative importance of spectra, texture, vegetation index and seasonality on classification accuracy, we design a series of classification feature sets, including: initial feature sets for different seasons, feature selection feature sets for different seasons and multi-seasonal feature sets. The results show that the multi-seasonal feature selection set has the best feature set performance (PA = 0.88; OA = 0.92; Kappa = 0.90). Our study demonstrates that the random forest classifier is reliable and practical for extracting tea plantations from medium-resolution images. Highlights of this study are: mapping tea plantations, an important cash crop to local agriculture, in a fragmented landscape; integrating textual, vegetational, and seasonal features, which were helpful for improving tea plantation mapping accuracy in combination; taking advantage of the feature selection function of random forest, supporting high-dimensional data classification, which leads to a higher classification accuracy.

AB Olive cultivation over the past few years has spread across Mediterranean countries with Spain being the world's largest olive producer among them. Because olives are a major part of the economy for such countries keeping records of their tree count and crop yield is of high significance. Manual counting of trees over such large areas is humanly infeasible. To address this problem, we propose an automatic method for the detection and enumeration of olive trees. The algorithm is a multi-step classification system comprising pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. RGB satellite images were acquired from the Spanish territory and pre-processed to suppress the additive noise. The region of interest was then segmented from the pre-processed images using K-Means segmentation, through which statistical features were extracted and classified. Promising results were achieved for all classifiers, namely Naive Bayesian, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), at various division ratios of data samples. In a comparison of all the classification algorithms, Random Forest outperformed the rest by an overall accuracy of 97.5% at the division ratio of 70 to 30 for training to testing.

AB High temporal and spatial resolution optical image time series have been proven efficient for crop type mapping at the end of the agricultural season. However, due to cloud cover and image availability, crop identification earlier in the season is difficult. The recent availability of high temporal and spatial resolution SAR image time series, opens the possibility of improving early crop type mapping. This paper studies the impact of such SAR image time series when used in complement of optical imagery. The pertinent SAR image features, the optimal working resolution, the effect of speckle filtering and the use of temporal gap-filling of the optical image time series are assessed. SAR image time series as those provided by the Sentinel-1 satellites allow significant improvements in terms of land cover classification, both in terms of accuracy at the end of the season and for early crop identification. Haralik textures (Entropy, Inertia), the polarization ratio and the local mean together with the VV imagery were found to be the most pertinent features. Working at at 10 m resolution and using speckle filtering yield better results than other configurations. Finally it was shown that the use of SAR imagery allows to use optical data without gap-filling yielding results which are equivalent to the use of gap-filling in the case of perfect cloud screening, and better results in the case of cloud screening errors.

AB Timely and accurate estimation of the winter wheat planting area and its spatial distribution is essential for the implementation of crop growth monitoring and yield estimation, and hence for the development of national agricultural production and food security. In remotely sensed winter wheat mapping based on spectral similarity, the reference curve is obtained by averaging multiple standard curves, which limits mapping accuracy. We propose a spectral reconstruction method based on singular value decomposition (SR-SVD) for winter wheat mapping based on the unique growth characteristics of crops. Using Sentinel-2 A/B satellite data, we tested the SR-SVD method in Puyang County, and Shenzhou City, China. Performance was increased, with the optimal overall accuracy and the Kappa of Puyang County and Shenzhou City were 99.52% and 0.99, and 98.26% and 0.97, respectively. We selected the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Euclidean Distance (ED) as the similarity measures. Compared to spectral similarity methods, the SR-SVD method significantly improves mapping accuracy, as it avoids excessive extraction, can identify more detailed information, and is advantageous in distinguishing non-winter wheat pixels. Three commonly used supervised classification methods, support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and minimum distance (MD) were used for comparison. Results indicate that SR-SVD has the highest mapping accuracy and greatly reduces the number of misidentified pixels. Therefore, the SR-SVD method can achieve high-precision crop mapping and provide technical support for monitoring regional crop planting structure information.

AB Conservation tillage management has been advocated for carbon sequestration and soil quality preservation purposes. Past satellite image analyses have had difficulty in differentiating between no-till (NT) and minimal tillage (MT) conservation classes due to similarities in surface residues, and may have been restricted by the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery. This study hypothesized that the inclusion of high temporal data into the classification process would increase conservation tillage accuracy due to the added likelihood of capturing spectral changes in MT fields following a tillage disturbance. Classification accuracies were evaluated for Random Forest models based on 250-m and 500-m MODIS, 30-m Landsat, and 30-m synthetic reflectance values. Synthetic (30-m) data derived from the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) were evaluated because high frequency Landsat image sets are often unavailable within a cropping season due to cloud issues. Classification results from a five-date Landsat model were substantially better than those reported by previous classification tillage studies, with 94% total and >= 88% class producer's accuracies. Landsat-derived models based on individual image scenes (May through August) yielded poor MT classifications, but a monthly increase in accuracy illustrated the importance of temporal sampling for capturing regional tillage disturbance signatures. MODIS-based model accuracies (90% total; >= 82% class) were lower than in the five-date Landsat model, but were higher than previous image-based and survey-based tillage classification results. Almost all the STARFM prediction-based models had classification accuracies higher than, or comparable to, the MODIS-based results (>90% total; >= 84% class) but the resulting model accuracies were dependent on the MODIS/Landsat base pairs used to generate the STARFM predictions. Also evident within the STARFM prediction-based models was the ability for high frequency data series to compensate for degraded synthetic spectral values when classifying field-based tillage. The decision to use MODIS or STARFM-based data within conservation tillage analysis is likely situation dependent. A MODIS-based approach requires little data processing and could be more efficient for large-area mapping; however a STARFM-based analysis might be more appropriate in mixed-pixel situations that could potentially compromise classification accuracy.

   MODIS; Harmonic features; Remote sensing
AB Cotton is one of the major cash crops in the world, which is the main fiber crop that delivers fibers to textile industries across the globe. The efficient and timely information of the cotton distribution is essential for cotton production, agricultural management, as well as the sustainability of agricultural systems. However, there still keep challenges in accurately extracting cotton cultivated area over large areas. To address this issue, we explored the feasibility of combining time series enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data with the fused representation-based classification (FRC) algorithm to identify the cotton pixels and map cotton cultivated area in the major cotton production regions of China. The Fourier transform was used to obtain the harmonic features of the annual time series EVI at a pixel scale over the study area. Then the FRC algorithm was applied for the identification of cotton cultivated area with harmonic features as input. By calculating the fused residual for each pixel, and setting the threshold value for each province based on the statistical data, the cotton cultivated area was extracted in the study area during 2015-2017. Finally, the performance of the FRC algorithm for cotton mapping was evaluated and compared with those of the collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) and sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithms. The results showed that there was a good correlation between the MODIS-derived cotton cultivated area and statistical data at the municipal level, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.83 for 3 years. The mapping results of the cotton cultivated area derived by the FRC algorithm had a higher precision compared with those derived by the CRC and SRC algorithms. It demonstrated that the combination of time series MODIS EVI data, statistical data and the FRC algorithm is effective in identifying the cotton cultivated area. Furthermore, the applicability of this approach to other crop mapping and higher spatial resolution images is worth investigating.

AB Accurate data acquisition and analysis to obtain crop canopy information are critical steps to understand plant growth dynamics and to assess the potential impacts of biotic or abiotic stresses on plant development. A versatile and easy to use monitoring system will allow researchers and growers to improve the follow-up management strategies within farms once potential problems have been detected. This study reviewed existing remote sensing platforms and relevant information applied to crops and specifically grapevines to equip a simple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using a visible high definition RGB camera. The objective of the proposed Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) was to implement a Digital Surface Model (DSM) in order to obtain accurate information about the affected or missing grapevines that can be attributed to potential biotic or abiotic stress effects. The analysis process started with a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from the RGB images collected from grapevines using the UAS and the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique to obtain the DSM applied on a per-plant basis. Then, the DSM was expressed as greyscale images according to the halftone technique to finally extract the information of affected and missing grapevines using computer vision algorithms based on canopy cover measurement and classification. To validate the automated method proposed, each grapevine row was visually inspected within the study area. The inspection was then compared to the digital assessment using the proposed UAS in order to validate calculations of affected and missing grapevines for the whole studied vineyard. Results showed that the percentage of affected and missing grapevines was 9.5% and 7.3%, respectively from the area studied. Therefore, for this specific study, the abiotic stress that affected the experimental vineyard (frost) impacted a total of 16.8 % of plants. This study provided a new method for automatically surveying affected or missing grapevines in the field and an evaluation tool for plant growth conditions, which can be implemented for other uses such as canopy management, irrigation scheduling and other precision agricultural applications.

AB The fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by a vegetation canopy is an important variable for global vegetation modelling and is operationally available from data of the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor starting from the year 2000. Product validation is ongoing and important for constant product improvement, but few studies have investigated the specific accuracy of MODIS FPAR using in situ measurements and none have focused on agricultural areas. This study therefore presents a validation of the collection 5 MODIS FPAR product in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in western Uzbekistan. High-resolution FPAR maps were compiled via linear regression between in situ FPAR measurements and the RapidEye normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the 2009 season. The data were aggregated to the MODIS scale for comparison. Data on the percentage cover of agricultural crops per MODIS pixel allowed investigation of the impact of spatial heterogeneity on MODIS FPAR accuracy. Overall, the collection 5 MODIS FPAR overestimated RapidEye FPAR between approximately 6% and 15%. MODIS quality flags, the underlying biome classification and spatial heterogeneity were investigated as potential sources of error. MODIS data quality was very good in all cases. A comparison of the MODIS land-cover product with high-resolution land-use classification revealed a significant misclassification by MODIS. Yet, we found that the overestimation of MODIS FPAR is independent of classification accuracy. The results indicate that the amount of background information, present even in the most homogeneous pixels (similar to 70% crop cover), is most likely the reason for the overestimation. The behaviour of pure pixels could not be investigated due to a lack of appropriate pixels.

ID RADIOMETRIC NORMALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES
AB A methodology to highlight changes in the landscape based on satellite image classification has been developed involving unsupervised and supervised approaches.
   With past acquisitions, ground truth data are in general not known, therefore the classification can only be unsupervised. These classifications provide labels but not surface types. The main difficulty lies in the interpretation of these classes. An automatic interpretation method has been developed to allocate semantics to classes thanks to a radiometric value catalogue. However, it requires radiometrically comparable images. After radiometric correction, the images are not free from defects; this is why a normalization method has been developed.
   We propose a specific methodology to evaluate changes consisting in regrouping classes of the same theme, smoothing and eroding contours without taking "mixels" into account and comparing the classified images to provide statistics and image changes. The different steps of the process are essential to avoid false changes and to quantify land cover change with a high degree of accuracy. Various statistical results are given: changes or no changes, types of changes, and crop rotations over several years.
   Land use /cover change (LUCC) can provide an estimate of carbon capture and storage. Reforestation, changing land use and best practices can increase carbon sequestration in biomass and soils for a period of several decades, which may constitute a significant contribution to the fight against the greenhouse effect. Deforestation, conversely, can lead to significant levels of CO2 emission.
   By application to the South-West region of Toulouse, we observe significant land cover changes over 11 years (1991-2002). The crop rotations are given for 4 years (year per year 2002-2005).

AB Coastal wetlands in the Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam, provide various vital ecosystem services for the region. These wetlands have experienced critical changes due to the increase in regional anthropogenic activities, global climate change, and the associated sea level rise (SLR). However, documented information and research on the dynamics and drivers of these important wetland areas remain limited for the region. The present study aims to determine the long-term dynamics of wetlands in the south-west coast of the MD using remote sensing approaches, and analyse the potential factors driving these dynamics. Wetland maps from the years 1995, 2002, 2013, and 2020 at a 15 m spatial resolution were derived from Landsat images with the aid of a hybrid classification approach. The accuracy of the wetland maps was relatively high, with overall accuracies ranging from 86-93%. The findings showed that the critical changes over the period 1995/2020 included the expansion of marine water into coastal lands, showing 129% shoreline erosion; a remarkable increase of 345% in aquaculture ponds; and a reduction of forested wetlands and rice fields/other crops by 32% and 73%, respectively. Although mangrove forests slightly increased for the period 2013/2020, the overall trend was also a reduction of 5%. Our findings show that the substantial increase in aquaculture ponds is at the expense of mangroves, forested wetlands, and rice fields/other crops, while shoreline erosion significantly affected coastal lands, especially mangrove forests. The interaction of a set of environmental and socioeconomic factors were responsible for the dynamics. In particular, SLR was identified as one of the main underlying drivers; however, the rapid changes were directly driven by policies on land-use for economic development in the region. The trends of wetland changes and SLR implicate their significant effects on environment, natural resources, food security, and likelihood of communities in the region sustaining for the long-term. These findings can assist in developing and planning appropriate management strategies and policies for wetland protection and conservation, and for sustainable development in the region.

AB Land cover is a powerful tool in urban management as a source of information to support authorities' decision making. In this paper, land cover of Eastern Economic Corridor cities in Thailand is performed using the aggregation of results from two Convolutional Neural Network models, with both using the same architecture. The first model is for the detection of water and the second is for the classification of land type consisting of 3 classes: city, forest and crop. In Firstly, the size of the 4 class existing dataset is increased resulting in an accuracy of 98% and 93% for the binary and three class CNN model respectively. To improve the land cover on satellite images an overlapping process is introduced in order to reduce the classification area from 0.25 km(2) to 0.004 km(2), using the same image resolution of 8 m per pixel. The use of the overlapping allows to propose a largely better land cover where the contour of the detected class is well produced. Moreover, this methods shows its better ability to detect smaller surface size and especially for the water, crops and forest class. However, it is showed that the overlapping method does not improved the accuracy of the prediction that is mainly related to the dataset size. Finally, the robustness of the proposed method to quickly perform a global land cover with limited computer power is demonstrated.

AB Due to the unfavorable soil conditions and water resources, the cropland use pattern in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China is complex. The program named "Grain for Green" has accelerated the cropland change. However, the complex cropland and retired cropland are challenging to monitor with remote sensing due to their spatially dispersed and easily confused with spectrally similar land use classes such as nature grasslands and non-cropped fields. Taking farming-pastoral ecotone in the northern foot of the Yinshan Mountains as a case study, we explored a classification approach for complex cropland and retired cropland, which was introduced as a specific land use class by using multi-temporal Landsat TM and OLI images with Google Earth Engine. During 1990-2000, cropland increased with a sharper growth and increased with a slower growth from 2001 to 2010, and then decreased significantly from 2011 to 2019, to lead the cropland area in 2019 was smaller than an area in 1990. We analyzed the spatiotemporal trajectories of retired cropland in 2019 using the Land Use Change Trajectory method to evaluate its source. In our finding, approximately 77% of retired cropland was labelled as cropland before 2019; albeit, not all retired cropland was converted from cropland. Moreover, we qualitatively assessed the vegetation dynamics in the study area by utilizing the long-term NDVI-mean value to reveal that vegetation coverage has shown a continuously increasing trend. It is related to the decline of cropland and the increase of retired cropland at the same rate. Our results highlighted that

AB LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is a remote-sensing technique for the measurement of the distance between the sensor and a target. A LiDAR-based detection procedure was tested for characterisation of the weed vegetation present in the inter-row area of a maize field. This procedure was based on the hypothesis that weed species with different heights can be precisely detected and discriminated using non-contact ranging sensors such as LiDAR. The sensor was placed in the front of an all-terrain vehicle, scanning downwards in a vertical plane, perpendicular to the ground, in order to detect the profile of the vegetation (crop and weeds) above the ground. Measurements were taken on a maize field on 3 m wide (0.45 m(2)) plots at the time of post-emergence herbicide treatments. Four replications were assessed for each of the four major weed species: Sorghum halepense, Cyperus rotundus, Datura ferox and Xanthium strumarium. The sensor readings were correlated with actual, manually determined, height values (r(2) = 0.88). With canonical discriminant analysis the high capabilities of the system to discriminate tall weeds (S. halepense) from shorter ones were quantified. The classification table showed 77.7% of the original grouped cases (i.e., 4800 sampling units) correctly classified for S. halepense. These results indicate that LiDAR sensors are a promising tool for weed detection and discrimination, presenting significant advantages over other types of non-contact ranging sensors such as a higher sampling resolution and its ability to scan at high sampling rates.

TI An evaluation of multiple land-cover data sets to estimate cropland area

ID GLOBAL CROPLAND; CLASSIFICATION; MAP
AB West Africa is one of the fastest growing regions of the world and depends heavily on rain-fed agriculture for its food production. This study evaluates 12 freely available land-cover and land-use (LCLU) data sets at the ecoregion, country, and pixel levels in West Africa to estimate croplands. The selected data sets are primarily derived using remote-sensing data, representing different time periods and using various classification schemes. The result shows a very high variability of the estimated cropland at all levels. Despite this variability, data sets having a finer spatial resolution and representing a similar time period -specifically data from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis-International Food Policy Research Institute (IIASA-IFPRI), Global Land Cover-Share (GLC-Share), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-University of Maryland (MODIS-UMD), Global Cropland Extent, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (MODIS-IGBP), and GlobCover version 2.3 (GlobCover V23) - estimated comparable cropland areas at the ecoregion and country levels. The countrywide cropland area, obtained from the selected data sets, when compared with the sum of arable land and permanent crop area obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), showed a high coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.95) for IIASA-IFPRI and GLC-Share. At the pixel level, at the original resolution, the newer data sets have a comparable user's accuracy (UA> 53%) and producer's accuracy (PA> 46%), except for the Global Cropland Extent data. Overall, two data sets - IIASA-IFPRI and GLC-Share - performed better in the region to estimate the cropland area at all levels.

AB Combining optical and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) earth observations offers a complementary data set with a significant number of spectral, textural, and polarimetric features for crop mapping and monitoring. Moreover, a temporal combination of both sources of information may lead to obtaining more reliable results compared to the use of single-time observations. In this paper, an operational framework based on the stacked generalization of random forest (RF), which efficiently employed bi-temporal observations of optical and radar data, was proposed for crop mapping. In the first step, various spectral, vegetation index, textural, and polarimetric features were extracted from both data sources and placed into several groups. Each group was classified separately using a single RF classifier. Then, several additional classification tasks were accomplished by another RF classifier. The earth observations used in this paper were collected by RapidEye satellites and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) system over an agricultural region near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology was able to provide a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient than traditional stacking method, and also than all the individual RFs using each group. These accuracy metrics were also better than those of the RFs using the stacked features. Moreover, only the proposed methodology could achieve standard accuracy (F-score 85%) for all crop types in the study area. The visual comparison also demonstrated that the crop maps produced by the proposed methodology had more homogeneous, uniform appearances. Moreover, the mixed pixels of crop types, which abundantly existed in the traditional stacking and individual RFs? maps, were significantly eliminated.

AB Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are satellite images that provide spectral and spatial detail of a given region. This makes them uniquely suitable to classify objects in the scene. Classification of Hyperspectral images can be efficiently performed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Machine Learning. In this research, a framework is proposed that leverages Transfer Learning and CNN to classify crop distributions of Horticulture Plantations. The Hyperspectral dataset consists of images and known labels, also known as groundtruth. However, some of the HSIs are unlabelled due to the lack of groundtruth available for the same. Hence, the proposed method adopts the Transfer Learning technique to overcome this. The model was trained on a publicly available and labelled hyperspectral dataset. This was then tested on the field samples of Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka, India which was provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The CNN built leverages both the spectral and spatial correlations of the HSIs. Due to the amount of detail in HSIs, they are fed in as patches into the convolutional layers of the network. The diverse information provided by these images is exploited by deploying a three-dimensional kernel. This joint representation of both spectral and spatial information provides higher discriminating power, thus allowing a more accurate classification of the crop distributions in the field. The experimental results of this method prove that feeding images as patches trains the CNN better and applying Transfer Learning has a more generic and wider scope.

AB Rice straw open-field burning is practiced in many countries and has been proven to be a significant source of emissions during the harvest season. Current approaches to obtain the fraction of rice straw subject to open burning vary significantly, and can lead to incorrectly estimating air pollutant emissions. This study proposes a remote sensing approach by classifying high-resolution imagery taken by Formosat-2 (FS-2) to map burned areas of rice paddy fields during harvest season to provide visualized and accurate estimations. We requested FS-2 image acquisition over the Chianan Plain, which is the greatest rice-producing area of Taiwan, during 3 weeks following the harvesting of the fall crops in 2009. Simultaneously, a mobile team on the ground examined the state of the rice paddies when FS-2 was scheduled to take the images. Based on these data, a procedure that integrated a ground truth-based classification scheme, land use data, spectral signatures, and supervised decision rules was applied to identify burned sites. The results were verified using the field data, with an overall accuracy of 87% for distinguishing among the 6 cover types of rice paddies, showing that 27.3% of the paddies within the study area were openly burned. Based on the mapping results, a comprehensive inventory of the air pollutant emissions from straw open burning in Taiwan is presented. To facilitate the management of emission sources and to improve local air quality, we encourage the use of FS-2 imaging to monitor the open burning of rice straw.

AB In the agriculture sector food productivity, security, and sustainability, imposed challenges on farmers, regulatory bodies, and policymakers due to increasing demand and depleting natural resources and environmental concerns. Rice crop holds a prominent place in Pakistan's agriculture sector, it is not only consumed locally but also exported to many countries including China. Gathering crop information such as variety maps, yield estimation, or etc. can help farmers, regulatory bodies, policymakers, and rice mills in decision-making. In Pakistan, crop information is collected through manual field surveys that require a lot of human labor, are costly, and are time-consuming. One cannot ignore human error and bias in the process. A new framework for pixel classification is proposed that uses both spectral and time-series data of Sentinal-2 satellite for mapping two rice varieties "Basmati" and "IRRI, grown in Pakistan. The data were collected from twelve rice fields (approx. 307 acres) of different geographical locations at 16-time instances to cover the complete rice-growing season (May-October) in 2019. A linear spectral unmixing model is used to determine sub-pixel information of water, soil, and vegetation content, which is used for labeling each pixel for supervised learning. The input to our classifier is a 16 x 15 image formed using 15 spectral features (12 spectral bands and 3 radiometric indices) of 16 carefully selected different time instances for each pixel. The output is a pixel-level classification (semantic segmentation) of each pixel into Basmati, IRRI, and others (soil, water, etc.). Experimental results have exhibited an excellent overall accuracy of 98.6% with the proposed approach. The Basmati rice obtained higher accuracy of 99.7% as compared to IRRI rice with an accuracy of 95.2%.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of remotely sensed imagery from the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) suite of satellite sensors to map crop residue and tillage practices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) is doing biennial national residue mapping. flue to the high costs involved, only a small number of fields could be surveyed. Also the methodology is subjective. Using remotely sensed imagery may help to reduce the costs, allow many more fields to be used in the program, as well as potentially increase accuracy. This investigation used the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer sensor (ASTER) for large area crop residue mapping. Residue covers from 421 corn fields within three Indiana counties were estimated following a windshield survey approach. The field level residue covers were divided into three levels: fields with >30% residue cover were classified as conservation tillage (no till); fields with 16-30% residue cover as reduced tillage; and fields with <15% residue cover as conventional tillage. Field mean spectral reflectance was extracted and several indices were calculated. The field level spectra and indices were then used in a discriminant analysis process. The results indicated that the ASTER Normalized Shortwave Index (ANSI) performed the best in separating no till from the combined conventional and reduced till fields. The average accuracy was 85.5% for all three counties with Huntington County having the best accuracy at 91%. In addition, pixel based supervised classifications were also implemented. The results showed that the shortwave near-infrared (SWIR) bands produced better classification accuracies than the visible near-infrared (VNIR) bands. While the use of ASTER images for corn residue mapping shows its potential, prior knowledge of the previous crop type is needed for successful operations.

AB In this study, new add-on bands in a multispectral dataset of WorldView-2, Digital-Globe's second next-generation satellite, have been evaluated. For extraction of a specific agriculture crop at a time, WorldView-2 multispectral single, as well as two-date data sets, were used. For this purpose, a class-based sensor independent spectral band ratio normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (CBSI-NDVI) and its possibilistice fuzzy classification approach was used. Different agriculture crops selected for the study were sugarcane, late wheat, cauliflower, berseem ( fodder), early wheat and ratoon. It is found that bands four and eight with temporal data are good for extracting sugarcane, while bands four, eight and five, seven with temporal data are suitable for late wheat and bands four and eight work well for cauliflower. Similarly, bands five, seven and five, eight with temporal data are good for extracting berseem (fodder), bands four, eight work for early wheat with temporal data and for ratoon four, six single date or four, six and four, eight temporal data. This suitability of bands has been observed with respect to a maximum membership value difference, as well as maximum entropy difference, between the two closest agriculture crops. Thus, it can be concluded that existing bands five, seven and new bands four, six, eight in WorldView-2 are important for identifying and mapping crops mentioned in this study. This indicates new bands, especially four, six, eight introduced in WorldView-2, are more effective than existing bands in QuickBird for mapping specific crops.

AB Knowledge of the location and extent of agricultural fields is required for many applications, including agricultural statistics, environmental monitoring, and administrative policies. Furthermore, many mapping applications, such as object-based classification, crop type distinction, or large-scale yield prediction benefit significantly from the accurate delineation of fields. Still, most existing field maps and observation systems rely on historic administrative maps or labor-intensive field campaigns. These are often expensive to maintain and quickly become outdated, especially in regions of frequently changing agricultural patterns. However, exploiting openly available remote sensing imagery (e.g., from the European Union's Copernicus programme) may allow for frequent and efficient field mapping with minimal human interaction. We present a new approach to extracting agricultural fields at the sub-pixel level. It consists of boundary detection and a field polygon extraction step based on a newly developed, modified version of the growing snakes active contours model we refer to as graph-based growing contours. This technique is capable of extracting complex networks of boundaries present in agricultural landscapes, and is largely automatic with little supervision required. The whole detection and extraction process is designed to work independently of sensor type, resolution, or wavelength. As a test case, we applied the method to two regions of interest in a study area in the northern Germany using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. Extracted fields were compared visually and quantitatively to ground reference data. The technique proved reliable in producing polygons closely matching reference data, both in terms of boundary location and statistical proxies such as median field size and total acreage.

AB Leaf area index is a basic quantity representing plant growth and is needed in regional and global agricultural, ecological and meteorological models. There are some factors that influence the LAI estimation, such as uncertainty in some of the parameters the model relies upon, the uncertainties of choosing different model, uncertainty from the instrument noise and data processing, bias in a priori knowledge used in the inversion process, and heterogeneity of the surface. The effects of heterogeneity in the remote sensing pixel on LAI estimation are investigated in this work. Mixed pixels are a major source of inconvenience in conventional classification; furthermore, it will affect the LAI estimation and validation. It is not our intention to discuss unmixing technique. Instead, we evaluate the uncertainty resulted by inverting LAI for a mixed pixels without unmixing. The result shows that the accuracy of LAI inversion is almost not affected by the different corn growth condition. However, it is shown that the accuracy of inverted LAI for mixed pixel is increasing with the increase of vegetation percent in a mixed pixel, when the LAI of corn is constant. The more areal proportion of vegetation, the higher accuracy of LAI inversion. Furthermore, the impact of the mixed pixel on the LAI validation is clearly visible. Field LAI measurements of sonic point don't stand for the pixel LAI when the pixel consists of crops of different growth or consists of different land typies. In this situation, we should be cautious for validation of inverted LAI.

AB Analysis of hybrid polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data has gained importance in the last couple of years with the availability of spaceborne data from Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1). RISAT-1 provides right circular transmit and linear receive data in Fine Resolution Stripmap-1 (FRS-1) mode with a swath of 25 km approximately covering 625 km2 areas. But an administrative unit, like a district, in India cannot be covered in single FRS-1 acquisition. In this article, the possibility of acquisition of multi-incidence angle FRS-1 data to cover a larger area in three consecutive days over Khagaria district of Bihar State, India, for maize crop discrimination and mapping was investigated. It was assumed that the difference of 3 days in imaging does not affect the backscatter response from maize crop as there will not be much change in the maize crop characteristics in 3 days. The backscatter response of maize crop, which is in maximum vegetative stage, was studied at three incidence angles (viz. 28 degrees, 42 degrees, and 52 degrees). The analysis was carried out for the discrimination of maize crop at each incidence angle in Raney derived hybrid decomposition parameters viz. Odd bounce, Double bounce, and Volume scattering mechanisms. The result shows that there is a slight difference in the backscatter response from maize crop due to the changes in incidence angle from 28 degrees to 42 degrees and has not shown any significant difference from 42 degrees to 52 degrees. However, the maize crop got well discriminated in the scatter plots of volume and double bounce scattering at both 28 degrees and 42 degrees and with odd and volume scattering combinations at 52 degrees. The classification of the multi-incidence angle data resulted in 47,732 ha of maize cropped area in Khagaria district during rabi (winter season), 2014-15 with the producer's accuracy of 92.00%.

AB The use of plastic covers for protecting cultivation in wide rural areas sets remarkable technical problems connected with the effects that large extensions of agricultural land covered with continuous cladding material may determine on aesthetic pollution of the rural landscape and on negative environmental impacts on water cycle, air and agricultural soil of the agro-ecosystem. In this paper, techniques based on remote sensing have been used for an analysis of the rural land use in terms of application of plastics in protected cultivation, in a study area located in Southern Italy near the coastline of the Jonian Sea, where the utilization of plastics in agriculture is widespread. The analysis has been realized using multitemporal Landsat TM images through Supervised classification, image processing, vectorialization and GIS tools. The results enabled the creation of a routine for the auto-detection of the plastic covers. The variation in the visual perception of the agricultural land was examined through a GIS software and a three-dimensional land modelling with solid extrusion and an overlap of the photographic images reproducing plastic-covered protected crops.
   The results of these simulations could be used for monitoring the variation of rural land use and supporting sound policies of landscape and environmental planning. Through a multi-variate approach to the analysis of environmental and landscape impacts, the concept of a "threshold" limit for the quantity of plastic-covered agricultural structures was proposed, and possible modification of texture and colour of the cladding material mitigating the aesthetic and environmental impact were evaluated.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) is a hotspot in the field of remote sensing, which has been widely used in disaster monitoring, environmental monitoring, resource exploration, and crop yield estimates. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved promising performance among a variety of supervised classification methods under the condition of sufficiently labeled samples. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to collect large amounts of labeled samples suitable for DCNNs in SAR domains. To reduce the dependence of SAR-ATR on labeled samples, in this work, a consistency regularization teacher-student semi-supervised (CRTS) method for SAR-ATR is proposed, in which consistency regularization is applied to analyze and divide unlabeled samples and the teacher-student structure is introduced to generate pseudo-labels for the divided unlabeled samples. Firstly, by using consistent pseudo-label prediction, unlabeled samples are divided into consistent unlabeled samples and confident unlabeled samples. Then, in order to improve the quality of pseudo-labeled labels, the student model is used to generate a pseudo-label for consistent unlabeled samples, and the teacher model which is ensembled by the other two student models labels the confident unlabeled samples. Finally, these pseudo-label unlabeled samples are mixed with the labeled samples and trained together to improve recognition performance. Experiments are conducted on the MSTAR dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. As compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the recognition accuracy shows the superiority of the proposed method, especially when the training dataset is limited.

AB Winter wheat is one of the most important crops planted in Beijing suburb. In recent 20 years, winter wheat planted area decreased obviously in Beijing area owning to the urbanization process. This study focuses on the winter wheat planted area transformation monitoring of Beijing suburb from 1992 to 2009 through remote sensing technique. Multi-temporal Landsat-TM images are collected during the winter wheat growth season of 1992,2000 and 2009 and used to analyze the trend and characteristics of winter wheat field variation in Beijing suburb in recent two decades years. The PCA analysis and Tasseled Cap transform technique are adopted in this study for feature classification. The study result shows that the winter wheat planted area in 1992,2000 and 2009 in Beijing is 113671 ha, 84322 ha and 61529 ha, respectively. It indicates that winter wheat planting area in Beijing has a significantly decreasing trend and the total reduced area is 52143 ha from 1992 to 2009. Winter wheat planted area is decreased by 29349 ha from 1992 to 2000. Most of reduced wheat fields are transformed into bare land or used for urban land accounting for 42.8% and 39.7%. Others wheat fields are used for greenhouse and water bodies (fish ponds and water fields), accounting for 13.3% and 3%. The winter wheat field decreased by 22794 ha from 2000 to 2009, more than 41.93% of wheat field is turned into bare land. Reduce field for greenhouse land and water bodies (ponds or water fields) are account for21.61% and 7.79%, respectively.

AB This contribution highlights the advantages of using a multidisciplinary modelling approach to the characterisation of the environmental dynamics of a typical semi-arid Mediterranean region, the Flumendosa river basin located in central Sardinia (Italy). Here, the widespread presence of geomorphological active processes interacts with the consequences of intense human activities on crop cultivation and forest management to produce a fragile environment the equilibrium of which must be carefully surveyed and maintained. To this end, an hydro-geomorphological soil erosion hazard model was devised and applied using remote sensing and G.I.S. techniques as support tools. Radiometric enhancement and supervised classification processing of multitemporal Landsat TM images were used to derive land cover information, allowing to understand the seasonal evolution of the area and to monitor the presence and movement of organic materials. These data were then combined with those derived from ground truth and ground survey campaigns concerning geology and geomorphology. At the same time, rainfall simulations were carried out in order to evaluate the principal parameters involved in the soil erosion processes. On these data a hydro-geomorphological model based on the spatial prevalence of the different erosion processes, was applied. Six main parameters (i.e. soil erosivity, land use, hillslope gradient and curvature, contributing area and soil infiltration capacity) were used and combined with a matrix linear combination. Results show that the model could represent, if routinely applied at a local administrative level, a valuable tool for forecasting the relative risk of soil erosion in the framework of a correct environmental management.

AB Terrestrial eco-system in coastal zones is unstable and land-use and Land-cover of its land resource are crucial for its sustainability. Therefore it is necessary to understand distribution of land use/cover changes in those tender areas. This paper was to analyze changes of land use/cover in Yellow River Delta in China during recent ten years, which was its fast development period, by remote sensing monitoring. Two Landsat TM images in October of 1995 and 2004 were processed using ERDAS software and supervised classification method in study for the land use and land cover of those two years. The two land use/cover maps were overlaid to discover the changes. It was showed that lots of land use/cover changes in the Yellow River Delta had taken place in past ten years. Because abundant sand that carried by river water filled up at estuary of the Yellow River, new land increased fleetly. The rates that foreshore were turned into fishery land was high for aquaculture with salt water had been developed quickly. Another important effect of human activity was that part of waste land and grassland had been cultivated for crops. With industry and economy development, land for urbanization had been outspreaded. Although fast exploitation had been carried out in Yellow River Delta going though those years, some human activities on land use were inharmonious for sustainable development of land resource in this area. This must be pay attention to by local government and people.

AB Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is one of the major yield-limiting soybean diseases in the Midwestern United States. Effective management for SDS requires accurate detection in soybean fields. Since traditional scouting methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often destructive, alternative methods to monitor SDS in large soybean fields are needed. This study explores the potential of using high-resolution (3 m) PlanetScope satellite imagery for detection of SDS using the random forest classification algorithm. Image data from blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands, the calculated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and crop rotation information were used to detect healthy and SDS-infected quadrats in a soybean field experiment with different rotation treatments, located in Boone County, Iowa. Datasets collected during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 soybean growing seasons were analyzed. The results indicate that spectral features, when combined with ground-based information, can detect areas in soybean plots that are at risk for disease, even before foliar symptoms develop. The classification of healthy and diseased soybean quadrats was >75% accurate and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was >70%. Our results indicate that high-resolution satellite imagery and random forest analyses have the potential to detect SDS in soybean fields, and that this approach may facilitate large-scale monitoring of SDS (and possibly other economically important soybean diseases). It may also be useful for guiding recommendations for site-specific management in current and future seasons.

AB Land use/land cover classifications for 1973 and 1991, derived from the interpretation of satellite imagery, are quantified on the basis of biophysical land units in a study area in southeastern Australia. Nutrient export potentials are estimated for each land unit based on their composition of land use/land cover classes. Spatial and temporal comparisons are made or the land units based on the calculated pollution hazard indicators to provide an insight into changes in the state of the environment and the regional significance of land use changes. For example, one ecosystem, unique to the study, showed a large increase in pollution hazard over the study period as a manifestation of an 11-fold rise in cleared area and an expansion of cropping activities. The benefits to environmental management in general are discussed.

AB Early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant, but hard to achieve. We hypothesize that close range hyperspectral imaging is able to uncover stress related processes non-destructively in the early stages which are invisible to the human eye. We propose an approach which combines unsupervised and supervised methods in order to identify several stages of progressive stress development from series of hyperspectral images. Stress of an entire plant is detected by stress response levels at pixel scale. The focus is on drought stress in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Unsupervised learning is used to separate hyperspectral signatures into clusters related to different stages of stress response and progressive senescence. Whereas all such signatures may be found in both, well watered and drought stressed plants, their respective distributions differ. Ordinal classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to quantify and visualize the distribution of progressive stages of senescence and to separate well watered from drought stressed plants. For each senescence stage a distinctive set of most relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) is identified. The method has been applied on two experiments involving potted barley plants under well watered and drought stress conditions in a greenhouse. Drought stress is detected up to ten days earlier than using NDVI. Furthermore, it is shown that some VIs have overall relevance, while others are specific to particular senescence stages. The transferability of the method to the field is illustrated by an experiment on maize (Zea mays). (C) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote sensing, Inc.

AB On-site controlling of subsidy measures in rural areas are cost- and time-intensive for authorities and can only be done for a small subset of subsidized areas within short time frames. The use of high resolution satellite image time series covers many applications in the field of agricultural monitoring. We present a method for an automated control system based on vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 image time series. We calculated a catch crop phenological reference profile (TS_ref) from a subset of sampling sites in the German federal state Rhineland-Palatinate and compared it with observed Sentinel time series (TS_obs) via Pearson's correlation coefficient. The utilization of the classification results reduces on-site controls noticeably and helps to define areas with higher and lower control demands.

DE aircraft recognition; remote sensing images; non-locally enhanced;

AB Aircraft recognition has great application value, but aircraft in remote sensing images have some problems such as low resolution, poor contrasts, poor sharpness, and lack of details caused by the vertical view, which make the aircraft recognition very difficult. Especially when there are many kinds of aircraft and the differences between aircraft are subtle, the fine-grained recognition of aircraft is more challenging. In this paper, we propose a non-locally enhanced feature fusion network(NLFFNet) and attempt to make full use of the features from discriminative parts of aircraft. First, according to the long-distance self-correlation in aircraft images, we adopt non-locally enhanced operation and guide the network to pay more attention to the discriminating areas and enhance the features beneficial to classification. Second, we propose a part-level feature fusion mechanism(PFF), which crops 5 parts of the aircraft on the shared feature maps, then extracts the subtle features inside the parts through the part full connection layer(PFC) and fuses the features of these parts together through the combined full connection layer(CFC). In addition, by adopting the improved loss function, we can enhance the weight of hard examples in the loss function meanwhile reducing the weight of excessively hard examples, which improves the overall recognition ability of the network. The dataset includes 47 categories of aircraft, including many aircraft of the same family with slight differences in appearance, and our method can achieve 89.12% accuracy on the test dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our method.

AB Remote sensing applied in the digital transformation of agriculture and, more particularly, in precision viticulture offers methods to map field spatial variability to support site-specific management strategies; these can be based on crop canopy characteristics such as the row height or vegetation cover fraction, requiring accurate three-dimensional (3D) information. To derive canopy information, a set of dense 3D point clouds was generated using photogrammetric techniques on images acquired by an RGB sensor onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in two testing vineyards on two different dates. In addition to the geometry, each point also stores information from the RGB color model, which was used to discriminate between vegetation and bare soil. To the best of our knowledge, the new methodology herein presented consisting of linking point clouds with their spectral information had not previously been applied to automatically estimate vine height. Therefore, the novelty of this work is based on the application of color vegetation indices in point clouds for the automatic detection and classification of points representing vegetation and the later ability to determine the height of vines using as a reference the heights of the points classified as soil. Results from on-ground measurements of the heights of individual grapevines were compared with the estimated heights from the UAV point cloud, showing high determination coefficients (R-2 > 0.87) and low root-mean-square error (0.070 m). This methodology offers new capabilities for the use of RGB sensors onboard UAV platforms as a tool for precision viticulture and digitizing applications.

AB The world has been alarmed with the global warming effects. Global warming has been a distress towards the environment, thus shorten the Earth's lifespan. It is a challenging task to reduce the global warming effects in a short period, knowing that the human population is increasing along with the electricity and energy demand. In order to reduce the effects, renewable energy is presented as an alternative method to produce energy in a way that will not harm the environment. Oil palm is one of the agricultural crops that produces huge amount of biomass which can be processed and used as a renewable energy source. In 2016, Malaysia has reported over 5 million hectares of land were covered by oil palm plantations. Placing Malaysia as the second largest country of oil palm producer in the world has given it an advantage to produce renewable energy source. However, there is a need to monitor the sustainability of oil palm plantations in Malaysia via effective mapping approaches. This study utilised two different platforms (open source and commercial) using a machine learning algorithm namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform oil palm mapping. An open source Python programming-based technique utilising Scikit-learn module was performed to map the oil palm distribution and the result produced had an overall accuracy of 91.39%. To support and validate the efficiency of the Python programming-based image classification, a commercial remote sensing software (ENVI) was used and compared by implementing the same SVM algorithm and the result showed an overall accuracy of 98.21%.

AB The presented study deals with classifications of agricultural land use based on stacks of TerraSAR-X images taken during the vegetation season and the Maximum Likelihood method. The investigations took place in three different regions that are located in the West and North of Germany as well as the Southeast of Poland. The highest producer's accuracies could be achieved for the classes oilseed rape (81% to 93%), potato (77% to 64%) and the group of grain crops (87% to 95%). A higher discrepancy of accuracies between the three study areas can be observed for maize (22%, 48%, and 82%) grasslands (39%, 71%, and 89%) and single grain classes e.g. wheat (43%, 65%, and 70%). Furthermore, strong variations of accuracies were observed for different test fields of the same class. This is probably due to either differences in the farmers' land management or a variation of local conditions (e.g. hydrology, inclination, soils). The presented results underline the capability of satellite radar for multitemporal classification of agricultural areas.

AB Agriculture is a primary productivity sector which is highly dependent on environmental conditions. The agroclimatic potential of agricultural areas has to be assessed in order to achieve sustainable and efficient use of natural resources in combination with production maximization. Temperature and rainfall, in terms of quantity and spatiotemporal variability, are variables which determine the type of crops suitable to a given location. Rainfall variable can also be interpreted as availability of sufficient water required for production of given crops. These variables, in combination with soil type and geomorphology, also determine areas where high levels of production are appropriate, avoiding the threat of degrading the natural resources. In the current work, zones indicating water availability are combined with topographic features and soil types in order to identify areas for sustainable production. Firstly, aridity index (AI) and vegetation health index (VHI) are used in order to define zones adequate for sustainable farming according to water limitations. As crop growth is affected by water supply, these zones are named water limited growth environment (WLGE) zones. AI and VHI are computed on monthly time step for twenty hydrological years, from October 1981 to September 2001. VHI is derived from NOAA/AVHRR data, while in AI computations both satellite and conventional field data are used. Then, WLGE zones are combined with soil maps and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the area under investigation in order to define zones appropriate for sustainable production. The study area is the aquatic district of Thessaly, located in Central Greece. The current application has resulted in the definition of sustainable production zones by means of parallelepiped supervised classification using the two indices, soil maps and DEM. These zones can be further used for agroclimatic classification.

AB The main objective of this study is to apply an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach to satellite image processing and determining crop residue cover (CRC) and tillage intensity. To achieve this goal, we collected ground truth data using line-transect method from 35 plots of farmlands with an area of 528 ha. Accordingly, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite image together with global positioning system (GPS)-based survey data set were considered for applying the OBIA methods and deriving CRC. To process the data, object-based image processing steps including segmentation and classification were applied to develop intelligent objects and establish classification using spectral and spatial characteristics of CRC. We developed three categories of rule sets including mean indices, tillage indices, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features using the OBIA algorithms and assign class method. Results were validated against of ground control data set and were collected by GPS in field survey. Results of this study indicated that the brightness, normalised difference tillage index, and GLCM texture feature mean performed out as effective techniques. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (kappa) were computed to be about 0.91 and 0.86; 0.93 and 0.90; 0.60 and 0.35, respectively, for the above-mentioned indices. The foregoing discussion has attempted to demonstrate that the remotely sensed data can be effective approach and substitute for ground methods, especially in large areas.

AB In South Cameroon the deforestation is mainly caused by slash-and-burn agriculture. This practice is conducted on small plots within the forest, leading to a diffuse pattern of deforested areas. In such a complex farming system, with cacao plantations under tree cover and inter-cropping, the significance of high resolution satellite data can be evaluated in terms of discrimination of the main land covers : savannahs, degraded forest and dense forest. This has been done on SPOT, ERS (received at the German transportable station in Libreville) and JERS SAR images. The classification algorithm used for SAR images is based on the statistical properties of the land covers (PAPRI algorithm). The results are presented, compared to SPOT classified images and a vegetation map, and the synergy between the different sensors is discussed.

AB High resolution satellite imagery and modern machine learning methods hold the potential to fill existing data gaps in where crops are grown around the world at a sub-field level. However, high resolution crop type maps have remained challenging to create in developing regions due to a lack of ground truth labels for model development. In this work, we explore the use of crowdsourced data, Sentinel-2 and DigitalGlobe imagery, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for crop type mapping in India. Plantix, a free app that uses image recognition to help farmers diagnose crop diseases, logged 9 million geolocated photos from 2017-2019 in India, 2 million of which are in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India. Crop type labels based on farmer-submitted images were added by domain experts and deep CNNs. The resulting dataset of crop type at coordinates is high in volume, but also high in noise due to location inaccuracies, submissions from out-of-field, and labeling errors. We employed a number of steps to clean the dataset, which included training a CNN on very high resolution DigitalGlobe imagery to filter for points that are within a crop field. With this cleaned dataset, we extracted Sentinel time series at each point and trained another CNN to predict the crop type at each pixel. When evaluated on the highest quality subset of crowdsourced data, the CNN distinguishes rice, cotton, and "other" crops with 74% accuracy in a 3-way classification and outperforms a random forest trained on harmonic regression features. Furthermore, model performance remains stable when low quality points are introduced into the training set. Our results illustrate the potential of non-traditional, high-volume/high-noise datasets for crop type mapping, some improvements that neural networks can achieve over random forests, and the robustness of such methods against moderate levels of training set noise. Lastly, we caution that obstacles like the lack of good Sentinel-2 cloud mask, imperfect mobile device location accuracy, and preservation of privacy while improving data access will need to be addressed before crowdsourcing can widely and reliably be used to map crops in smallholder systems.

AB With the acquisition of polarimetric radar data from satellites such as RADARSAT-2 and ALOS PALSAR, this research project explored the potential of using multipolarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to map homogenous soil and crop characteristics within agricultural fields. Homogenous zones within crop fields were defined using coincidental apparent soil electrical conductivity (EC) measured from a soil EC mapping system, green leaf area index (LAI) derived from airborne hyperspectral CASI data, and yield converted to phytomass at harvest (P-h) derived from a yield monitor. Airborne polarimetric C-band SAR images (5.6 cm) at 4 m spatial resolution were obtained over a test site in Ottawa, Canada, on 13 June, 26 June, and 19 July 2001. Linear (HH, VV, HV) and circular (RR, LL, RL) polarization images were synthesized from these data. Once the homogenous zones were determined by EC, LAI, and P-h, the multipolarization SAR data were classified based on these zones using single polarizations and combinations of linear and circular polarizations. Within-field classification accuracies of SAR data were higher when they were based on EC and LAI homogenous zones relative to P-h delineations. The lower SAR classification accuracies based on P-h zones were likely attributed to biomass zones defined relative to harvest rather than coincident with SAR data acquisition. LAI zones were better classified using early season SAR data when greater between-zone variability was present. EC homogenous zones were better classified using SAR data later in the growing season when soil variability was manifested in the vegetation response. Within-field classification performance over the season was dependent on the crop type and the incidence angle. At larger incidence angles (55), results were more dependent on crop type when compared with smaller incidence angles (35). In general, a single polarization was capable of discriminating many of the within-field homogenous zones, including EC and LAI zones in corn and LAI and P-h zones in wheat. The linear (HV) and circular (LL or RR) cross-polarizations were the best single polarizations to classify these homogenous zones. Within-field classification of the SAR into EC homogenous zones in the wheat field required polarization combinations, particularly combinations that included HH and VV polarizations. Circular polarizations, either as single polarizations or as part of a combination, were necessary to classify SAR data into EC or LAI homogenous zones as the season progressed. These results suggest that multipolarization SAR data are useful in classifying within-field homogenous zones of corn and wheat, but that this application will require access to data from sensors that synthesize circular polarizations.

AB The agriculturization as particular process of change in the use of land is one of the drivers of the Global Change and consequently it causes environmental transformations. The aims of this work were to analyze the exchange rates annual in the use of land in Tandil department, between 1988 and 2015, in order to characterize the process of agriculturization in the landscapes that compose it; to determine the crops with the highest incidence in this process and to identify the main ecosystem services affected. Methodologically were obtained satellite images and supervised classifications. Also were used official statistics, background studies and field surveys. The results shows an increase in the area intended to agriculture at the expense of livestock with an annual change rate of 3.28 (especially in the distal plain) and an alteration in the composition of the main crops. It is observed how this context favors the supplying services and the deterioration of most of the regulating and cultural services. The analysis of changes in land use is a useful tool to take dimension of the process of agriculturization and its associated impacts.

AB To achieve sustainable development and to ensure water availability in hydrological basins, water managers need tools to determine the actual evapotranspiration (ET) on a large scale. Field energy balances from irrigated and natural ecosystems together with a net of agro-meteorological stations were used to develop two models for ET quantification at basin scale, based on the Penman-Monteith equation. The first model (PM1) uses the resistances to the latent heat fluxes estimated from satellite measurements, while the second one (PM2) is based on the ratio of ET to the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and its relation to remote sensing parameters. The models were applied in the Low-Middle Sao Francisco river basin in Brazil and, after comparison against field results, showed good agreements with PM1 and PM2 explaining, respectively, 79% and 89% of the variances and mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.44 and 0.34 mm d(-1). Even though the PM1 model was not chosen for ET calculations, the equation for surface resistance (r(s)) was applied to infer the soil moisture conditions in a simplified vegetation classification. The maximum values of r(s) were for natural vegetation-caatinga (average of 1,937 s m(-1)). Wine grape and mango orchard presented similar values around 130 s m(-1), while table grape presented the lowest ones, averaging 74 s m(-1). Petrolina and Juazeiro, in Pernambuco (PE) and Bahia (BA) states, respectively, were highlighted with the biggest irrigated areas. The highest increments are for vineyards and mango orchards. For the first crop the maximum increment was verified between 2003 and 2004 in Petrolina-PE, when the cultivated area increased 151%. In the case of mango orchards the most significant period was from 2005 to 2006 in Juazeiro-BA (129%). As the best performance was for PM2, it was selected and used to analyse the regional ET at daily and annual scales, making use of Landsat images and a geographic information system for different soil moisture conditions. Considering the daily rates of the regional ET, pixels with values lower than 1.0 mm d(-1) occurred outside the rainy season, representing the caatinga species. Values from 1.0 to 5.0 mm d(-1) during the driest conditions of the year coincided with irrigated crops, being the highest values for table grapes. The highest accumulated ET values during 2006 were for mango orchards, being around 500-1,300 mm yr(-1). Vineyards presented lower values, ranging from 450-800 mm yr(-1), while in caatinga they were between 200 and 400 mm yr(-1). It could be concluded that irrigated mango orchards and vineyards in that year consumed more water than caatinga by factors of 3 and 2, respectively. The mango orchards and vineyard areas, representing 19.4 and 8.2% of the total irrigated area, respectively, resulting in a total evaporative depletion of 0.22 km(3) yr(-1) in the growing regions comprised of the agro-meteorological stations.

AB The World Bank argued that West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part of "Africa's Sleeping Giant,"where increases in agricultural production could be an engine of economic growth, through expansion of cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni, in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which since the mid-1980s has provided support for intensive agricultural systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of mineral fertilizer. In the period of the panel survey (1994-2012), cropped land at household level was correlated with household size: households with less than one full team of draft oxen cultivated 0.50 ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated 0.82 ha/family member (R-2 > 0.8). At the village level, cropped land increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency. However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25% of household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple viable pathways towards desirable futures.

AB For large areas, it is difficult to assess the spatial distribution and inter-annual variation of crop acreages through field surveys. Such information, however, is of great value for governments, land managers, planning authorities, commodity traders and environmental scientists. Time series of coarse resolution imagery offer the advantage of global coverage at low costs, and are therefore suitable for large-scale crop type mapping. Due to their coarse spatial resolution, however, the problem of mixed pixels has to be addressed. Traditional hard classification approaches cannot be applied because of sub-pixel heterogeneity. We evaluate neural networks as a modeling tool for sub-pixel crop acreage estimation. The proposed methodology is based on the assumption that different cover type proportions within coarse pixels prompt changes in time profiles of remotely sensed vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Neural networks can learn the relation between temporal NDVI signatures and the sought crop acreage information. This learning step permits a non-linear unmixing of the temporal information provided by coarse resolution satellite sensors. For assessing the feasibility and accuracy of the approach, a study region in central Italy (Tuscany) was selected. The task consisted of mapping the spatial distribution of winter crops abundances within 1 km AVHRR pixels between 1988 and 2001. Reference crop acreage information for network training and validation was derived from high resolution Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) images and official agricultural statistics. Encouraging results were obtained demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach. For example, the spatial distribution of winter crop acreage at sub-pixel level was mapped with a cross-validated coefficient of determination of 0.8 with respect to the reference information from high resolution imagery. For the eight years for which reference information was available, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of winter crop acreage at sub-pixel level was 10%. When combined with current and future sensors, such as MODIS and Sentinel-3, the unmixing of AVHRR data can help in the building of an extended time series of crop distributions and cropping patterns dating back to the 80s.

AB The spatial-temporal evolution of land use and land cover (LULC) and its multi-scale impact on the water environment is becoming highly significant in the LULC research field. The current research results show that the more significant scale impact on LULC and water quality in the whole basin and the riparian buffer scale is unclear. A consensus has not been reached about the optimal spatial scale problem in the relationship between the LULC and water quality. The typical lake basin of the Fuxian Lake watershed was used as the research area and the scale relationship between the LULC and water quality was taken as the research object. High resolution remote sensing images, archival resources of surveying, mapping and geographic information, and the monitoring data of water quality were utilized as the main data sources. Remote sensing and Geometric Information Technology were applied. A multi-scale object random forest algorithm (MSORF) was used to raise the classification accuracy of the high resolution remote sensing images from 2005 to 2017 in the basin and the multi-scale relationship between the two was discussed using the Pearson correlation analysis method. From 2005 to 2017, the water quality indicators (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Phosphorous (TP), Total Nitrogen (TN)) of nine rivers in the lake's basin and the Fuxian Lake center were used as response variables and the LULC type in the basin was interpreted as the explanation variable. The stepwise selection method was used to establish a relationship model for the water quality of the water entering the lake and the significance of the LULC type was established at p < 0.05.The results show that in the seven spatial scales, including the whole watershed, sub-basin, and the riparian buffer zone (100 m, 300 m, 500 m, 700 m, and 1,000 m): (1) whether it is in the whole basin or buffer zone of different pollution source areas, impervious surface area (ISA), or other land and is positively correlated with the water quality and promotes it; (2) forestry and grass cover is another important factor and is negatively correlated with water quality., (3) cropping land is not a major factor explaining the decline in water quality; (4) the 300 m buffer zone of the river is the strongest spatial scale for the LULC type to affect the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Reasonable planning for the proportion of land types in the riparian zone and control over the development of urban land in the river basin is necessary for the improvement of the urban river water quality. Some studies have found that the relationship between LULC and water quality in the 100 m buffer zone is more significant than the whole basin scale. While our study is consistent with the results of research conducted by relevant scholars in Aibi Lake in Xinjiang, and Erhai and Fuxian Lakes in Yunnan. Thus, it may be inferred that for the plateau lake basin, the 300 m riparian buffer is the strongest spatial scale for the LULC type to affect COD.

AB The worldwide demand for food has been increasing due to the rapidly growing global population, and agricultural lands have increased in extent to produce more food crops. The pattern of cropland varies among different regions depending on the traditional knowledge of farmers and availability of uncultivated land. Satellite images can be used to map cropland in open areas but have limitations for detecting undergrowth inside forests. Classification results are often biased and need to be supplemented with field observations. Undercover cropland inside forests in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia was assessed using field observed percentage cover of land use/land cover classes, and topographic and location parameters. The most influential factors were identified using Boosted Regression Trees and used to map undercover cropland area. Elevation, slope, easterly aspect, distance to settlements, and distance to national park were found to be the most influential factors determining undercover cropland area. When there is very high demand for growing food crops, constrained under restricted rights for clearing forest, cultivation could take place within forests as an undercover. Further research on the impact of undercover cropland on ecosystem services and challenges in sustainable management is thus essential.

AB This paper presents a system for weed mapping, using imagery provided by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Weed control in precision agriculture is based on the design of site-specific control treatments according to weed coverage. A key component is precise and timely weed maps, and one of the crucial steps is weed monitoring, by ground sampling or remote detection. Traditional remote platforms, such as piloted planes and satellites, are not suitable for early weed mapping, given their low spatial and temporal resolutions. Nonetheless, the ultra-high spatial resolution provided by UAVs can be an efficient alternative. The proposed method for weed mapping partitions the image and complements the spectral information with other sources of information. Apart from the well-known vegetation indexes, which are commonly used in precision agriculture, a method for crop row detection is proposed. Given that crops are always organised in rows, this kind of information simplifies the separation between weeds and crops. Finally, the system incorporates classification techniques for the characterisation of pixels as crop, soil and weed. Different machine learning paradigms are compared to identify the best performing strategies, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised techniques. The experiments study the effect of the flight altitude and the sensor used. Our results show that an excellent performance is obtained using very few labelled data complemented with unlabelled data (semi-supervised approach), which motivates the use of weed maps to design site-specific weed control strategies just when farmers implement the early post-emergence weed control.

AB This paper develops a new crop mapping method through combined utilization of both time and frequency information based on wavelet variance and Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance (CIWJ for short). A two-dimensional wavelet spectrum was obtained from datasets of daily continuous vegetation indices through a continuous wavelet transform using the Mexican hat and the Morlet mother wavelets. The time-average wavelet variance (TAWV) and the scale-average wavelet variance (SAWV) were then calculated based on the wavelet spectrum of the Mexican hat and the Morlet wavelet, respectively. The class separability based on the JM distance was evaluated to discriminate the proper period or scale range applied. Finally, a procedure for criteria quantification was developed using the TAWV and SAWV as the major metrics, and the similarity between unclassified pixels and established land use/cover types was calculated. The proposed CIWJ method was applied to the middle Hexi Corridor in northwest China using 250-m 8-day composite moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series datasets in 2012. The CIWJ method was shown to be efficient in crop field mapping, with an overall accuracy of 83.6 % and kappa coefficient of 0.7009, assessed with 30 m Chinese Environmental Disaster Reduction Satellite (HJ-1)-derived data. Compared with methods utilizing information on either frequency or time, the CIWJ method demonstrates tremendous potential for efficient crop mapping and for further applications. This method could be applied to either coarse or high spatial resolution images for agricultural crop identification, as well as other more general or specific land use classifications.

AB Spatial and temporal variabilities of NPP(Net Primary Production) retrieved from two satellite instruments, AVHRR(Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, 1981-2000) and MODIS(MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, 2000-2006), were investigated. The range of mean NPP from AVHRR and MODIS were estimated to be 894-1068 g . C/m(2)/yr and 610-694.90 g . C/m(2)/yr, respectively. The discrepancy of NPP between the two instruments is about 325 g . C/m2/yr, and MODIS product is generally closer to the ground measurement than AVHRR despite the limitation in direct comparison such as spatial resolution and vegetation classification. The higher NPP values over South Korea are related to the regions with higher biomass (e.g., mou tains) and higher annual temperature. The interannual NPP trends from the two satellite products were computed, and both mean annual trends show continuous NPP increase; 2.14 g . C/m(2)/yr from A (1981-2000) and 6.08 g . C/m(2)/yr from MODIS (2000-2006) over South Korea. Specifically, the higher increasing trends over the Southwestern region are likely due to the increasing productivity of crop fields from sufficient irrigation and fertilizer use. The retrieved NPP shows a closer relationship between monthly temperature and precipitation, which results in maximum correlation during summer monsoons. The difference in the detection wavelength and model schemes during the retrieval can make a significant difference in the satellite products, and a better accuracy in the meterological and land use data and modeling applications will be necessary to improve the satellite-based NPP data.

AB Thematic mapping of complex landscapes, with various phenological patterns from satellite imagery, is a particularly challenging task. However, supplementary information, such as multitemporal data and/or land surface temperature (LST), has the potential to improve the land cover classification accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, in order to map land covers, we evaluated the potential of multitemporal Landsat 8' s spectral and thermal imageries using a random forest (RF) classifier. We used a grid search approach based on the out-of-bag (OOB) estimate of error to optimize the RF parameters. Four different scenarios were considered in this research: (1) RF classification of multitemporal spectral images, (2) RF classification of multitemporal LST images, (3) RF classification of all multitemporal LST and spectral images, and (4) RF classification of selected important or optimum features. The study area in this research was Naghadeh city and its surrounding region, located in West Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran. The overall accuracies of first, second, third, and fourth scenarios were equal to 86.48, 82.26, 90.63, and 91.82 %, respectively. The quantitative assessments of the results demonstrated that the most important or optimum features increase the class separability, while the spectral and thermal features produced a more moderate increase in the land cover mapping accuracy. In addition, the contribution of the multitemporal thermal information led to a considerable increase in the user and producer accuracies of classes with a rapid temporal change behavior, such as crops and vegetation.

AB Oil palm is rapidly expanding in Southeast Asia and represents one of the major drivers of deforestation in the region. This includes both industrial-scale and smallholder plantations, the management of which entails specific challenges, with either operational scale having its own particular social and environmental challenges. Although, past studies addressed the mapping of oil palm with remote sensing data, none of these studies considered the discrimination between industrial and smallholder plantations and, furthermore, between young and mature oil palm stands. This study assesses the feasibility of mapping oil palm plantations, by typology (industrial versus smallholder) and age (young versus mature), in the largest palm oil producing region of Indonesia (Riau province). The impact of using optical images (Sentinel-2) and radar scenes (Sentinel-1) in a Random Forest classification model was investigated. The classification model was implemented in a cloud computing system to map the oil palm plantations of Riau province. Our results show that the mapping of oil palm plantations by typology and age requires a set of optimal features, derived from optical and radar data, to obtain the best model performance (OA = 90.2% and kappa = 87.2%). These features are texture images that capture contextual information, such as the dense harvesting trail network in industrial plantations. The study also shows that the mapping of mature oil palm trees, without distinction between smallholder and industrial plantations, can be done with high accuracy using only Sentinel-1 data (OA = 93.5% and kappa = 86.9%) because of the characteristic backscatter response of palm-like trees in radar scenes. This means that researchers, certification bodies, and stakeholders can adequately detect mature oil palm stands over large regions without training complex classification models and with Sentinel-1 features as the only predictive variables. The results over Riau province show that smallholders represent 49.9% of total oil palm plantations, which is higher than reported in previous studies. This study is an important step towards a global map of oil palm plantations at different production scales and stand ages that can frequently be updated. Resulting insights would facilitate a more informed debate about optimizing land use for meeting global vegetable oil demands from oil palm and other oil crops.

ID PLANT-DISEASES; PREDICTION; NITROGEN
AB Crop disease is a major biological hazard in agriculture of China and causes serious interference to farming process, so a fast, accurate and efficient diagnosis method for crop disease is in pressing need. Compared to some common crop disease detection technologies (such as polymerase chain reaction technique, artificial sensory evaluation technique, and statistical method), which are time-consuming or can only be used to detect obvious disease spots, spectral technology has potential in rapid detection of crop diseases and has been studied extensively. This passage mainly focuses on the application of visible/near infrared spectroscopy technology in disease detection, discusses instruments involved in this technology, and analyzes research status of visible/near infrared spectroscopy in disease detection from cell, plant tissue, canopy and larger scale aspects. At present, most of researches on visible/near infrared spectroscopy related to plant diseases are based on plant leaves. Few researches are on smaller scale (from cell to microscale) or larger scale (from canopy to aeronautical/spaceflight remote sensing scale), especially when it comes to disease researches on single cell scale, which are only done in the field of animal cells and have no successful application of visible/near infrared technology. However, visible/near infrared technology has many successful application in researches which are on organ scale of plant leaves. Most of common crops and major diseases of common crops, and diseases caused by fungal and bacterial pathogens are involved in current researches of disease detection. These researches are studied usually in three ways: (1) automatic and rapid diagnosis of disease information based on computer image processing and pattern recognition technology, (2) judgement model spectral analysis for Region of Interest (ROI) extracted from hyperspectral images was established based on stoichiometric method, (3) spectral model of some physical and chemical parameters of leaves related to crop diseases was established to quantify the extent of disease. The main problem related to this scale is that the research is so fragmented, which means only one or a few kinds of diseases are studied, that models can only be used in very specific conditions and can't be used directly to make a full automatic judgment on field samples. What's more, there are few studies on direct monitoring of crop diseases or multi-spectral imaging of near ground whole plants and the classification methods adopted are similar with those of leaf scale data processing. In near ground canopy scale, three dimensional forms of plants become a new source of interference in the spectral model, and some passage showed that 2D image was used as disease detection data with a percentage deviation of 13%. Finally, according to the present situation of all aspects of researches, it is believed that visible /near infrared spectroscopy technology has a good application prospect in crop disease detection, but it is in the bottleneck period now. There exist some problems, including that unbalanced research content of plant disease detection, lack of systematisms caused by overabundance of disease species and insufficient cooperation of different subjects. According to those problems, this passage points out that visible/near infrared spectroscopy technology should pay more attention to the in-depth cooperation of multidisciplinary in the field of disease detection, and it is urgent to make breakthroughs in the related equipment and method model.

AB Land-cover (LC) mapping in a morphologically heterogeneous landscape area is a challenging task since various LC classes (e.g., crop types in agricultural areas) are spectrally similar. Most research is still mostly relying on optical satellite imagery for these tasks, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is often neglected. Therefore, this research assessed the classification accuracy using the recent Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data for LC mapping, especially vegetation classes. Additionally, ancillary data, such as texture features, spectral indices from S1 and S2, respectively, as well as digital elevation model (DEM), were used in different classification scenarios. Random Forest (RF) was used for classification tasks using a proposed hybrid reference dataset derived from European Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS), CORINE, and Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) LC database. Based on the RF variable selection using Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), the combination of S1 and S2 data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 91.78%, with a total disagreement of 8.22%. The most pertinent features for vegetation mapping were GLCM Mean and Variance for S1, NDVI, along with Red and SWIR band for S2, whereas the digital elevation model produced major classification enhancement as an input feature. The results of this study demonstrated that the aforementioned approach (i.e., RF using a hybrid reference dataset) is well-suited for vegetation mapping using Sentinel imagery, which can be applied for large-scale LC classifications.

AB This study employed a data fusion method to extract the high-similarity time series feature index of a dataset through the integration of MS (Multi-Spectrum) and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. The farmlands are divided into small pieces that consider the different behaviors of farmers for their planting contents in Taiwan. Hence, the conventional image classification process cannot produce good outcomes. The crop phenological information will be a core factor to multi-period image data. Accordingly, the study intends to resolve the previous problem by using three different SPOT6 satellite images and nine Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar images, which were used to calculate features such as texture and indicator information, in 2019. Considering that a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) index (i) can integrate different image data sources, (ii) can integrate data of different lengths, and (iii) can generate information with time characteristics, this type of index can resolve certain classification problems with long-term crop classification and monitoring. More specifically, this study used the time series data analysis of DTW to produce "multi-scale time series feature similarity indicators". We used three approaches (Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Decision Tree) to classify paddy patches into two groups: (a) the first group did not apply a DTW index, and (b) the second group extracted conflict predicted data from (a) to apply a DTW index. The outcomes from the second group performed better than the first group in regard to overall accuracy (OA) and kappa. Among those classifiers, the Neural Network approach had the largest improvement of OA and kappa from 89.51, 0.66 to 92.63, 0.74, respectively. The rest of the two classifiers also showed progress. The best performance of classification results was obtained from the Decision Tree of 94.71, 0.81. Observing the outcomes, the interference effects of the image were resolved successfully by various image problems using the spectral image and radar image for paddy rice classification. The overall accuracy and kappa showed improvement, and the maximum kappa was enhanced by about 8%. The classification performance was improved by considering the DTW index.

AB While publicly available, cost-free coarse and medium spatial resolution satellite data such as MODIS and Landsat perform well in characterizing industrial cropping systems, commercial high spatial resolution satellite data are often preferred alternative for fine scale land tenure agricultural systems such as found in Pakistan. In this article, we integrated commercial 5 m spatial resolution RapidEye and free 30 m Landsat imagery in characterizing winter wheat in Punjab province, Pakistan. Specifically, we used 5 m spatial resolution RapidEye imagery from peak of the winter wheat growing season to derive training data for the characterization of time-series Landsat data. After co-registration, each RapidEye image was classified into wheat/no wheat labels at the 5 m resolution and then aggregated as percent cover to 30 m Landsat grid cells. We produced four maps, two using RapidEye derived continuous training data (of percent wheat cover) as input to a regression tree model, and two using RapidEye derived categorical training data as input to a classification tree model. From the RapidEye-derived 30 m continuous training data, we derived Map 1 as percent wheat per pixel, and Map 2 as binary wheat/no wheat classification derived using a 50% threshold applied to Map 1. To create the categorical wheat/no wheat training data, we first converted the continuous training data to a wheat/no wheat classification, and then used these categorical RapidEye training data to produce a categorical wheat map from the Landsat data. Two methods for categorizing the training data were used. The first method used a 50% wheat/no wheat threshold to produce Map 3, and the second method used only pure wheat (>= 75% cover) and no wheat (<= 25% cover) training pixels to produce Map 4. The approach of Map 4 is analogous to a standard method in which whole, pure, high-confidence training pixels are delineated. We validated the wheat maps with field data collected using a stratified, two-stage cluster design. Accuracy of the maps produced from the percent cover training data (Map 1 and Map 2) was not substantially better than the accuracy of the maps produced from the categorical training data as all methods yielded similar overall accuracies (+/- standard error): 88% (+/- 4%) for Map 1, 90% (+/- 4%) for Map 2, 90% (+/- 4%) for Map 3, and 87% (+/- 4%) for Map 4. Because the percent cover training data did not produce significantly higher accuracies, sub-pixel training data are not required for winter wheat mapping in Punjab. Given sufficient expertise in supervised classification model calibration, freely available Landsat data are sufficient for crop mapping in the fine-scale land tenure system of Punjab. For winter wheat mapping in Punjab and other like landscapes, training data for supervised classification may be collected directly from Landsat images without the need for high resolution reference imagery.

AB To keep pace with increasing demands for food, China is advancing robust policies on food security, and policy-oriented adjustments in crop planting area are needed to strike a balance among environmental sustainability, socio-economic development, agriculture and food security. To this end, the crop area adjustment policy was introduced in northeast China since 2015 and the policy provides incentives for quick planting area changes between different crops. However, geospatial data that quantify the magnitude and direction of these crop area adjustments are grossly inadequate in content and accuracy, thereby limiting our understanding of the overall policy impacts. To fill these data needs, applying the random forest (RF) classification algorithm on temporal images of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (011) acquired over the Heilongjiang Province (1235 scenes) in 2015 and 2016, this study proposed an integrated approach to the identification and monitoring of adjustments in the planting areas of maize, soybean and paddy rice. Overall crop classification accuracies of 88.7% and 87.9% were obtained for 2015 and 2016, respectively, and our approach further accounted for localized error distribution patterns. The result indicated that the area of soybean and maize had a significant change in 2016 (maize area decreased by 22.0% with about 1,261,775 ha and soybean area increased by 39.8% with about 696,653 ha, compared to 2015). The expansion in soybean-planted area recorded in this study is mostly in regions that previously mapped suitable for soybean cultivation based on local agro-climatic factors. The decrease in maize-planted area in tandem with the increase in soybean-planted area is significant in the northern parts of the Songneng Plain where initial profit differentials between the two crops are minimal due to being more suitable for soybean, and where with the introduction of subsidies, soybean recorded higher profits per unit area than maize. This suggests that with more incentives to cover the profit margin between soybean and maize, or the direction of subsidies to areas where soybean naturally records higher yields as a function of land suitability, the crop area adjustment policy is expected to achieve its goal in Heilongjiang. The current study, having provided information on the relative shifts in agricultural land-uses as informed by agricultural policy and land suitability data at a biannual scale, more detailed studies that would apply the proposed approach to multiple years of satellite data are therefore encouraged to provide information on the dynamics of agricultural land-use as informed by climate-induced changes inland suitability, market demand and government policy.

TI DESTIN: A new method for delineating the boundaries of crop fields by
   fusing spatial and temporal information from WorldView and Planet
   satellite imagery

LA English
DT Article
DE Field boundary delineation; Imagery segmentation; WorldView; Planet;
   Crop phenology
AB The digital boundaries of crop fields represent a prerequisite for designing parcel-based crop management platforms, implementing online site-specific agronomic practices and monitoring crop growth per field. Previous approaches on field boundary delineation were mostly developed with medium resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat) for the regions or countries with intensive agriculture and large-sized crop fields. However, suitable delineation methods are scarce for the regions in developing countries where the majority of arable land is cultivated by smallholder farmers and distributed in small and fragmented crop fields. This study proposed a comprehensive method, delineation by fusing spatial and temporal information (DESTIN), to derive the boundaries of crop fields from sub-meter WorldView-2/3 and 3-m Planet imagery. After extraction of spatial objects from very high resolution (VHR) WorldView imagery, this method performed recognition of crop field objects using high resolution (HR) Planet-derived temporal features specifically concerning soil preparation and harvesting stages for summer crops. The performance of DESTIN in crop field boundary delineation was evaluated with the reference polygons (0.4-1.0 ha in area on average) over four subset areas in eastern China's Jiangsu province, and further compared with a benchmark objection extraction approach.
   The results demonstrated that the integration of WorldView and Planet imagery as demanded by DESTIN yielded accurate recognition of crop fields with the classification overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 94.98% to 98.84%, which was remarkably improved over the use of WorldView or Planet imagery alone with increases in OA from 12% to 17%. The majority of crop field boudaries were successfully delineated with both methods, but DESTIN produced cleaner polygons than the benchmark appraoch and closer matches of field boundaries to the reference. DESTIN also yielded better one-to-one matches between delineations and reference (77% as opposed to 54%) and fewer one-to-many matches (1% as opposed to 33%) as a reflection of being less prone to over segmentation. The DESTIN method does not need subjective parameterization for image segmentation, and could be applicable to the areas with availability of bi-temporal VHR imagery over the soil preparation and harvesting stages and HR imagery over the peak growth stage of summer crops. It has great potential for delineating the crop field boundaries in smallholder farming systems with VHR imagery acquired from satellite, airborne or unmanned aerial vehicle platforms.

AB We hypothesised that digital mapping of various forms of salt-affected soils using high resolution satellite imagery, supported by field studies, would be an efficient method to classify and map salinity, sodicity or both at paddock level, particularly in areas where salt-affected patches are small and the effort to map these by field-based soil survey methods alone would be inordinately time consuming. To test this hypothesis, QuickBird satellite data (pan-sharpened four band multispectral imagery) was used to map various forms of surface-expressed salinity in an agricultural area of South Australia. Ground-truthing was performed by collecting 160 soil samples over the study area of 159km(2). Unsupervised classification of the imagery covering the study area allowed differentiation of severity levels of salt-affected soils, but these levels did not match those based on measured electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the soil samples, primarily because the expression of salinity was strongly influenced by paddock-level variations in crop type, growth and prior land management. Segmentation of the whole image into 450 paddocks and unsupervised classification using a paddock-by-paddock approach resulted in a more accurate discrimination of salinity and sodicity levels that was correlated with EC and SAR. Image-based classes discriminating severity levels of salt-affected soils were significantly related with EC but not with SAR. Of the spectral bands, bands 2 (green, 520-600nm) and 4 (near-infrared, 760-900nm) explained the majority of the variation (99 per cent) in the spectral values. Thus, paddock-by-paddock classification of QuickBird imagery has the potential to accurately delineate salinity at farm level, which will allow more informed decisions about sustainable agricultural management of soils.

AB Many wild species are affected by human activities occurring at broad spatial scales. For instance, in South America, habitat loss threatens Greater Rhea (Rhea americana) populations, making it important to model and map their habitat to better target conservation efforts. Spatially explicit habitat modeling is a powerful approach to understand and predict species occurrence and abundance. One problem with this approach is that commonly used land cover classifications do not capture the variability within a given land cover class that might constitute important habitat attribute information. Texture measures derived from remote sensing images quantify the variability in habitat features among and within habitat types; hence they are potentially a powerful tool to assess species - habitat relationships. Our goal was to explore the utility of texture measures for habitat modeling and to develop a habitat suitability map for Greater Rheas at the home range level in grasslands of Argentina. Greater Rhea group size obtained from aerial surveys was regressed against distance to roads, houses, and water, and land cover class abundance (dicotyledons, crops, grassland, forest, and bare soil), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and selected first-and second-order texture measures derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Among univariate models, Rhea group size was most strongly positively correlated with texture variables derived from near infrared reflectance measurement (TM band 4). The best multiple regression models explained 78% of the variability in Greater Rhea group size. Our results suggest that texture variables captured habitat heterogeneity that the conventional land cover classification did not detect. We used Greater Rhea group size as an indicator of habitat suitability; we categorized model output into different habitat quality classes. Only 16% of the study area represented high-quality habitat for Greater Rheas (group size >= 15). Our results stress the potential of image texture to capture within-habitat variability in habitat assessments, and the necessity to preserve the remaining natural habitat for Greater Rheas.

AB Field observations in two regions of European Russia (Kostroma and Samara oblasts) in summer 2010, reinforced by satellite imagery, provide a basis for a team of U.S. and Russian geographers to investigate ongoing changes in agricultural land use since the early 1990s. The authors highlight the contrasting situations in Kostroma (northern European Russia), where agriculture is limited and in retreat beyond relatively small scale operations in suburbia, and Samara (southern European Russia), where agricultural activity appears to be sustainable, albeit on a somewhat less extensive spatial scale than in the past. The comparison suggests that the change from central planning to unregulated market has not been popular, and that crop farming in both regions has better prospects than animal husbandry.

AB Surface soil moisture is variable, and it plays a crucial role in many processes in the soil- atmosphere interface. The knowledge of the surface soil moisture is very helpful for retrieving the spatial- temporal distribution of water-logging of agriculture field. The capability of microwave remote sensing has been proven that due to its all-weather, day-round measurement and sensitive backscattering coefficient to soil water content, it can derive quantitative soil moisture information from active and passive sensor systems at various spatial resolutions. Soil surface roughness and vegetation of agriculture field are also two main factors influenced on radar backscattering coefficient. So many models have been developed to calculate surface soil moisture, for example, Integral Equation Model (IEM) for bare field, the semi-empirical water cloud model and a novel method for agriculture field. However, these models need too many parameters. It is difficult to use them easily and widely. The paper retrieved the surface soil moisture in cotton fields using 79 ASAR GM images data from 2007-2011 during cotton growing periods. The auxiliary parameters were calculated using MODIS data. The main method was following: (1) got the spatial distribution of land-use classification using crop time series characteristics and MODIS data, (2) corrected the matrix pixels data of backscattering coefficient using the land-use classification data, (3) separated backscattering coefficient influenced by soil and vegetation using the semi-empirical water-cloud model and calculated the model's parameters by ASAR GM data under water saturation state using non-linear statistic mode and the vegetation water content from NDVI data calculated by MODIS data, (4) calculated soil surface moisture by ASAR GM time-series data using the corrected soil backscattering coefficient. This method does not require any auxiliary data beforehand. Compared the method value with the measured data sitting on cotton field in SIHU region, the results indicated that this method was corrected (R2=0.779 n=25). And the spatial temporal distribution of surface soil moisture during cotton growing periods was calculated.

AB Agricultural soils are the primary anthropogenic source of N2O emissions, one of the most important greenhouse gases, because of the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. The proposed method provides access to an inventory of potential N2O emissions (the term potential refers to possible but not yet actual) at a fine scale, with an annual update, without a heavy deployment linked to a collection of field measurements. The processing chain is applied to optical satellite images regularly acquired at a high spatial resolution during the 2006-2015 period, allowing a better spatial and temporal resolution of the estimates of potential N2O emissions from crops. The yearly potential N2O emissions inventory is estimated over a study site located in southwestern France, considering seven main seasonal crops (i.e., wheat, barley, rapeseed, corn, sunflower, sorghum and soybean). The first step of the study, that is the land use classification, is associated with accurate performances, with an overall accuracy superior to 0.81. Over the study area, the yearly potential budget of N2O emissions ranges from 97 to 113 tons, with an estimated relative error of less than 5.5%. Wheat, the main cultivated crop, is associated with the maximum cumulative emissions regardless of the considered year (with at least 48% of annual emissions), while maize, the third crop regarding to the allocated area (grown on less than 8% of the study site), has the second highest cumulative emissions. Finally, the analysis of a 10-year map of the potential N2O budget shows that the mainly observed crop rotation (i.e., alternating of wheat and sunflower) reaches potential emissions close to 16 kg N2O emitted per hectare, while the monoculture maize is associated with the maximum value (close to 28.9 kg per hectare).

AB Monitoring agricultural land is important for understanding and managing food production, environmental conservation efforts, and climate change. The United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture. By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional, national, and global land cover classification maps.

AB A precise knowledge of the crop distribution in the landscape is crucial for the agricultural sector to inform better management and logistics. Crop-type maps are often derived by the supervised classification of satellite imagery using machine learning models. The choice of data sampled during the data collection phase of building a classification model has a tremendous impact on a model's performance, and is usually collected via roadside surveys throughout the area of interest. However, the large spatial extent, and the varying accessibility to fields, often makes the acquisition of appropriate training data sets difficult. As such, in situ data are often collected on a best-effort basis, leading to inefficiencies, sub-optimal accuracies, and unnecessarily large sample sizes. This highlights the need for new more efficient tools to guide data collection. Here, we address three tasks that one commonly faces when planning to collect in situ data: which survey route to select among a set logistically feasible routes; which fields are the most relevant to collect along the chosen survey route; and how to best augment existing in situ data sets with additional observations. Our findings show that the normalised Moran's I index is a useful indicator for choosing the survey route, and that sequential exploration methods can identify the most important fields to survey on that route. The provided recommendations are flexible, overcome the main logistical constraints associated with in situ data collection, yield accurate results, and could be incorporated in a mobile application to assist data collection in real-time.

AB This paper discusses research methodology to develop Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps for the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) for basin planning, using both MODIS and Landsat satellite data. The 2010 MODIS MOD09 and MYD09 8-day reflectance data was processed into monthly NDVI maps with the Time Series Product Tool software package and then used to classify regionally common forest and agricultural LULC types. Dry season circa 2010 Landsat top of atmosphere reflectance mosaics were classified to map locally common LULC types. Unsupervised ISODATA clustering was used to derive most LULC classifications. MODIS and Landsat classifications were combined with GIS methods to derive final 250-m LULC maps for Sub-basins (SBs) 1-8 of the LMB. The SB 7 LULC map with 14 classes was assessed for accuracy. This assessment compared random locations for sampled types on the SB 7 LULC map to geospatial reference data such as Landsat RGBs, MODIS NDVI phenologic profiles, high resolution satellite data, and Mekong River Commission data (e.g., crop calendars). The SB 7 LULC map showed an overall agreement to reference data of similar to 81%. By grouping three deciduous forest classes into one, the overall agreement improved to similar to 87%. The project enabled updated regional LULC maps that included more detailed agriculture LULC types. LULC maps were supplied to project partners to improve use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool for modeling hydrology and water use, plus enhance LMB water and disaster management in a region vulnerable to flooding, droughts, and anthropogenic change as part of basin planning and assessment.

AB Annual variation of U.S. corn production is an important matter of world concern. To assure immediate response to large-scale harvest failure in crop exporting regions, as was the case during the severe U.S. drought in 2012, and to enhance global food security, a practical crop growth monitoring system based on satellite data is required. This study developed a practical method for near real-time prediction of U.S. corn yields using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) taken 7 days before the corn silking stage. We incorporated two algorithms into the MODIS-based corn yield prediction method; namely, (1) a MODIS-based crop classification algorithm in consideration of differences in emergence dates between corn and soybean, and (2) a simple bias correction algorithm for correcting region-dependent yield prediction errors. The method is able to predict the annual variation of national and state level corn grain yields with high accuracy in early August and detect corn yield reductions and poor-harvest regions due to drought damage, as in 2002 and 2012, on a near real-time basis in advance of those provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The method also predicted a national-level U.S. corn grain yield for 2013, which was 3.8% lower than the NASS-statistical data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Begomoviruses are widely distributed and causing devastating diseases in many crops. According to the number of genomic components, a begomovirus is known as either monopartite or bipartite begomovirus. Both the monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses have the DNA-A component which encodes all essential proteins for virus functions, while the bipartite begomoviruses still contain the DNA-B component. The satellite molecules, known as betasatellites, alphasatellites or deltasatellites, sometimes exist in the begomoviruses. So, the genomic components of begomoviruses are complex and varied. Different genomic components have different gene structures and functions. Classifying the components of begomoviruses is important for studying the virus origin and pathogenic mechanism.
   Methods. We propose a model combining Subsequence Natural Vector (SNV) method with Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, to classify the genomic components of begomoviruses and predict the genes of begomoviruses. First, the genome sequence is represented as a vector numerically by the SNV method. Then SVM is applied on the datasets to build the classification model. At last, recursive feature elimination (RFE) is used to select essential features of the subsequence natural vectors based on the importance of features.
   Results. In the investigation, DNA-A, DNA-B, and different satellite DNAs are selected to build the model. To evaluate our model, the homology-based method BLAST and two machine learning algorithms Random Forest and Naive Bayes method are used to compare with our model. According to the results, our classification model can classify DNA-A, DNA-B, and different satellites with high accuracy. Especially, we can distinguish whether a DNA-A component is from a monopartite or a bipartite begomovirus. Then, based on the results of classification, we can also predict the genes of different genomic components. According to the selected features, we find that the content of four nucleotides in the second and tenth segments (approximately 150-350 bp and 1,450-1,650 bp) are the most different between DNA-A components of monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses, which may be related to the pre-coat protein (AV2) and the transcriptional activator protein (AC2) genes. Our results advance the understanding of the unique structures of the genomic components of begomoviruses.

AB Pre-visual detection of crop disease is critical for food security. Field-based spectroscopic remote sensing offers a method to enable timely detection, but still requires appropriate instrumentation and testing. Soybean plants were spectrally measured throughout a growing season to assess the capacity of leaf and canopy level spectral measurements to detect non-visual foliage symptoms induced by Fusarium virguliforme (Fv, which causes sudden death syndrome). Canopy reflectance measurements were made using the Piccolo Doppio dual field-of-view, two-spectrometer (400 to 1630 nm) system on a tractor. Leaf level measurements were obtained, in different plots, using a handheld spectrometer (400 to 2500 nm). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was applied to the spectroscopic data to discriminate between Fv-inoculated and control plants. Canopy and leaf spectral data allowed identification of Fv infection, prior to visual symptoms, with classification accuracy of 88% and 91% for calibration, 79% and 87% for cross-validation, and 82% and 92% for validation, respectively. Differences in wavelengths important to prediction by canopy vs. leaf data confirm that there are different bases for accurate predictions among methods. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was used on a late-stage canopy level data to predict soybean seed yield, with calibration, cross-validation and validation R-2 values 0.71, 0.59 and 0.62 (p < 0.01), respectively, and validation root mean square error of 0.31 t.ha(-1). Spectral data from the tractor mounted system are thus sensitive to the expression of Fv root infection at canopy scale prior to canopy symptoms, suggesting such systems may be effective for precision agricultural research and management.

AB The tea plantations of Yunnan province are mainly fragmentally distributed in mountainous areas and often mixed with other ground objects, making it difficult to extract tea plantations with high precision based on remote sensing. Combining textures and spatial features based on Object-Oriented method is rarely applied to extract tea plantations in previous crop classification research using multi-spectral imagery. Therefore, it is necessary to explore further the recognition ability for tea plantations by using high spatial resolution and multi-spectral images under the fragmental and mountainous region. In this research, a typical mountainous area located between the northern Xishuangbanna autonomous prefecture and the southern of Puer city was used as our study area. A scene image with a 2 m resolution pan-chromatic and 8 m resolution multi-spectral derived from the GF-1 PMS sensor was used as the source data for our research. The eCognition Developer 9.0 software was employed to segment the image by multi-resolution segmentation, and the ED3Modified method was used to evaluate the optimal segmentation scale. Firstly,we constructed 23 dimensions of original features including 14 spectral features, 6 textures and 3 spatial features. Secondly, 16 optimal features were selected to classify by calculating the separation distance of five land-cover types. Thirdly, based on 16 optimal features space, three object-oriented supervised classification methods (Bayes, Decision Tree 5.0 (DT) and Random Forest (RF) were applied to extract the tea plantations of the study area. Finally, filed survey samples and random samples were used to validate the accuracy of tea plantations extraction results, and we compared the classification accuracies of different classification methods. The results showed that for the multi-classification (including tea plantations, forest, cropland, impervious and water body) the overall accuracy (OA)/ Kappa coefficient (Kappa) are Bayes (87.73%/0.70), DT5.0 (91.23%/0.78) and RF (88.52%/0.72) respectively, but for tea plantations, the producer accuracy (PA)/user accuracy (UA) are Bayes (67.23%/75.33%), DT (68.84%/83.83%) and RF (70.54%/87.13%). Compared with the object-oriented RF multi-classification, the OA and Kappa of the object-oriented RF binary classification (tea plantations and others) increased by 3.24% and 0.07, the PA/UA of tea plantations increased by 5.99%/5.61%. Similarly, compared with the pixel-based multi-classification, the OA and Kappa of the object-oriented RF binary classification increased by 23.32% and 0.27, the PA/UA of tea plantations increased by 21.10%/29.03%, respectively. The results indicated that the object-oriented supervised classification methods have the potential for tea plantations extraction, especially the object-oriented RF classification got a higher accuracy. Moreover, the binary classification method has higher accuracy than that of multi-classification for tea plantation extraction. Our object-oriented method that combined textures and spatial features with spectral features is effective for tea plantations extraction, especially when applied to the complex and fragmental mountainous landscape. Our method can meet the application requirements in fine tea plantations identification based on high-spatial resolution and multi-spectral imagery too.

AB Drought adversely affects vegetation conditions and agricultural production and consequently the food security and livelihood situation of the often most vulnerable communities. In spite of recent advances in modeling drought risk and impact, coherent and explicit information on drought hazard, vulnerability and risk is still lacking over wider areas. In this study, a spatially explicit drought hazard, vulnerability, and risk modeling framework was investigated for agricultural land, grassland and shrubland areas. The developed drought hazard model operates on a higher spatial resolution than most available drought models while also being scalable to other regions. Initially, a logistic regression model was developed to predict drought hazard for rangelands and croplands in the USA. The drought hazard model was cross-verified for the USA using the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The comparison of the model with the USDM showed a good spatiotemporal agreement, using visual interpretation. Subsequently, the explicit and accurate USA model was transferred and calibrated for South Africa and Zimbabwe, where drought vulnerability and drought risk were assessed in combination with drought hazard. The drought hazard model used time series crop yields data from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and biophysical predictors from satellite remote sensing (SPI, NDVI, NDII, LST, albedo). A McFadden's Pseudo R-2 value of 0.17 for the South African model indicated a good model fit. The plausibility of the drought hazard model results in southern Africa was evaluated by using regional climate patterns, published drought reports and a visual comparison to a global drought risk model and food security classification data. Drought risk and vulnerability were assessed for southern Africa and could also be spatially explicit mapped showing, for example, lower drought vulnerability and risk over irrigated areas. The innovative aspect of the presented drought hazard model is that it can be applied to other countries at a global scale, since it only uses globally available data sets and therefore can be easily modified to account for country-specific characteristics. At the same time, it can capture regional drought conditions through a higher resolution than other existing global drought hazard models. This model addressed the gap between global drought models, that cannot spatially and temporally explicitly capture regional drought effects, and sub-regional drought models that may be spatially explicit but not spatially transferable. Since we used globally available and spatially consistent data sets (both as predictors and response variables), the approach of this study can potentially be used globally to enhance existing modelling routines, drought intervention strategies and preparedness measures.

AB In supervised learning, the algorithm accuracy usually improves with the size of the labeled dataset used for training the classifier. However, in many real-life scenarios, obtaining enough labeled data is costly or even not possible. In many circumstances, Data Augmentation (DA) techniques are usually employed, generating more labeled data for training machine learning algorithms. The common DA techniques are applied to already labeled data, generating simple variations of this data. For example, for image classification, image samples are rotated, cropped, flipped or other operators to generate variations of input image samples, and keeping their original labels. Other options are using Neural Networks algorithms that create new synthetic data or to employ Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) that label existing unlabeled data. In this paper, we perform a comparison among graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) algorithms to augment the labeled dataset. The main advantage of using GSSL is that we can increase the training set by adding nonannotated images to the training set, therefore, we can benefit from the huge amount of unlabeled data available. Experiments are performed on five datasets for recognition of handwritten digits and letters (MNIST and EMINIST), animals (Dogs vs Cats), clothes (MNIST-Fashion) and remote sensing images (Brazilian Coffee Scenes), in which we compare different possibilities for DA, including the GSSL, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and traditional Image Transformations (IT) applied on input labeled data. We also evaluated the impact of such techniques on different convolutional neural networks (CNN). Results indicate that, although all DA techniques performed well, GSSL was more robust to different image properties, presenting less accuracy variation across datasets.

AB Biodiversity hotspots are conservation priority areas that feature exceptionally high levels of species endemism and high levels of habitat loss. The Guinean Forests of West Africa hotspot, home to a quarter of all the mammal species of Africa, has experienced high levels of forest loss within its protected areas. Here, we analyzed tree cover loss and its proximate drivers within Guinee Forestiere, a high biodiversity region within the Guinean Forests of West Africa hotspot, both inside and outside protected areas. Using Landsat analysis ready data and a regionally calibrated, annual forest change detection model, we mapped tree cover loss occurring across this region from 2000 to 2018. We quantified the area of tree cover loss and identified proximate drivers using a statistical sample of reference data. The total tree cover loss in Guinee Forestiere between years 2000 and 2018 was 10,907 km(2) (SE 889 km(2)), which consists of approximately 25% of the region's total land area. Of this total loss, 364 km(2) (SE 91 km(2)) occurred within protected areas of high biodiversity value. Tree cover loss was not consistent across high biodiversity areas and did not appear to be related to protected area classification. Smallholder agriculture (subsistence and cash crop farming) was the primary driver of tree cover loss across Guinee Forestiere. This research provides multitemporal spatial data on tree cover dynamics that is required for effective implementation of sustainable management and biodiversity conservation strategies within the broader socioecological landscape of Guinee Forestiere. We also highlight important limitations to consider and address when using remote sensing to automate change detection across landscapes.

AB This study explores the potential for predicting the spatial variation in subsurface water level change with crop growth stage from satellite data in Thabua Irrigation Project, situated in the northern central region of Thailand. The relationship between subsurface water level change from pumping water to irrigate rice in the dry season and the age of the rice was analysed. The spatial model of subsurface water level change was developed from the classification using greenness or (normalized difference vegetation index NDVI) derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data. The NDVI of 52 rice fields was employed to assess its relationship to the age of the rice. It was found that NDVI and rice age have a good correlation (R-2 = 0(.)73). The low NDVI values (-0(.)059 to 0(.)082) in these fields were related to the young rice stage (0(.)30 days). NDVI and subsurface water level change were also correlated in this study and found to have a high correlation (Water level change (m day(-1)) = 0(.)3442 x NDVI - 0(.)0372; R-2 = 0(.)96). From this model, the water level change caused by rice at different growth stages was derived. This was used to show the spatial variation of water level change in the project during the 1998-99 dry-season cropping. This simple method of using NDVI relationships with water level change and crop growth stages proves to be useful in determining the areas prone to excessive lowering of the subsurface water level during the dry season. This could assist in the appropriate planning of the use of subsurface water resources in dry-season cropping. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The increase in agricultural production is facing several challenges with future implications for food security and environmental protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate a remote sensing-based low-cost methodology for assessing the effects of dicamba and 2,4 Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4D) in a non-tolerant soybean crop. Here, we introduced the application of six vegetation indices (VI) derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based Red-Green-Blue (RGB) imagery contrasting with a conventional approach of visual injury criteria classification to estimate soybean plant injury and the effect on grain yield. The results demonstrated the feasibility of Modified Green-Red Vegetation Index (MGRVI) and Excess Green (ExG) strongly correlated with the effects of dicamba and 2,4D in soybean. These VIs discriminated plant injury caused by dicamba and 2,4D up to 5% of the recommended dose. The Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) considering the effect on grain yield was around 13% (72.80 g a.e. ha(-1)), 55% (552.75 g a.e. ha(-1)) and 48% (482.40 g a.e. ha(-1)) for dicamba; 2,4D dimethylamine (DMA) and 2,4D choline (CHO) of the recommended dose, respectively. This study revealed noteworthy limitations for the RGB indices to discriminate between the effects of different formulations of the same herbicide, as for 2,4D DMA and 2,4D CHO. With expectations for the introduction of new genetic soybean events and alongside new synthetic auxin compounds, our results pointed out that the proposed methodology can lead to a protocol for identifying and estimating the damage to the off-target movement from these outcoming herbicides on neighbourhood fields.

AB One of the important areas where satellite images can play a key role in the monitoring of the temporal changes is the vegetated cover regions. In particular, the conversion of natural vegetation cover types in human dominated areas is still changing on a global scale with a number of unknown consequences for the environment. In these difficult circumstances, vegetation growth monitoring technique has been proposed to monitor the agriculture fields on vegetation patterns of major unimodal (i.e. annual or yearly growth information) and bimodal (i.e. biannual or half yearly growth information) changes during the growth of the different crops. The study region which is considered in this paper contains many agricultural fields and at least two cultivation period are there to observe the unimodal and bimodal greenness change information. This type of information can be achieved by properly analysing the time series satellite images, which provides a good temporal resolution satellite images which might be having a moderate spatial resolution and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) may be one of the good option for this purpose. To analyse the unimodal and bimodal greenness, it is important to segregate the agriculture areas and then mark the area of unimodal and bimodal greenness prone zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have attempted to analyse one year satellite data of study region using harmonic analysis and proposed a probability density function (PDF) based classification technique for segregating the agriculture areas. These segregated areas are further utilized to obtain the unimodal and bimodal greenness prone zones. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in northeastern Libya has undergone rapid, wide-ranging changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose, urbanization, and other socioeconomic benefits. This study examined the use of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to gain a quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC. In addition, the major factors behind LULC changes and decline of natural vegetation in the region were analyzed. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes in the study area between 1985 and 2017 using four Landsat images from 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017. The observed changes were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of the natural Mediterranean forest which lost 9018 ha over 32 years, 39% of its total area, with the highest deforestation rate registered between 2010 and 2017 estimated at 513 ha. year(-1). Orchards and rain-fed agriculture lands gained 4095 ha, which matches 55% of initial area, whereas the land under irrigated crops increased by 2266 ha, about 85% of the original area. The area of urban and built-up land in 2017 was more than double in 1985 and achieved the highest urbanization rate between 2010 and 2017 at 203 ha.year(-1). Results indicate an unstable trend of bare and low vegetation lands which generally increased by about 50%. From the outcomes of this research, it is strongly recommended that urgent measures be taken to conserve the natural forest and to achieve a rational use of agricultural land in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar.

AB The Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS) is a development platform for optical remote sensing concepts, algorithms and special environments. For Real-Time Services for Maritime Security (EMSec joint project) a new multi-sensor configuration MACS-Mar was realized. It consists of 4 co-aligned sensor heads in the visible RGB, near infrared (NIR, 700-950 nm), hyperspectral (HS, 450-900 nm) and thermal infrared (TIR, 7.5.14 mu m) spectral range, a mid-cost GNSS/INS system, a processing unit and two data links. On-board image projection, cropping of redundant data and compression enable the instant generation of direct-georeferenced high resolution image mosaics, automatic object detection, vectorization and annotation of floating objects on the water surface. The results were transmitted over a distance up to 50 km in real-time via narrow and broadband data links and were visualized in a maritime situation awareness system.
   For the automatic onboard detection of objects a segmentation and classification workflow based on RGB, NIR and TIR information was developed and tested in September 2016. The completeness of the object detection in the experiment resulted in 95%, the correctness in 53%. Mostly bright backwash of ships led to overdetection of the number of objects, further refinement using water homogeneity in the TIR, as implemented in the workflow, couldn't be carried out due to problems with the TIR sensor. To analyze the influence of high resolution TIR imagery and to reach the expected detection quality a further experiment was conducted in August 2017. Adding TIR images the completeness was increased to 98% and the correctness to 74%.

AB This study discusses vegetation recovery and land cover change with reference to the Chiufenershan landslide, a major disaster caused by the Chichi earthquake, 21 September 1999. Image classification technology, landscape indicators from multi-temporal remotely sensed data and a field survey provide the data. Image differencing methods and threshold values coupled with pre- and post-quake satellite images were used. Multi-temporal images in combination with various vegetation indices were drawn on to classify land cover patterns and discuss differences and suitability of indices. Landscape indicators and field investigations fed into an investigation of vegetation recovery and landscape change. The study results show that the best image classification system is original wavebands coupled with a cropping management factor index (CMFI). The land cover analysis shows that areas of forest and grass are increasing and areas of landslide are decreasing. From the field investigation, because the left and right sides of the landslide area were not disturbed by the earthquake, their calculated similarity index is the highest (30.08%). Miscanthus floridulus is the most dominant pioneer plant at the landslide collapse area with an importance value index (IVI) of 63.6%.

AB Monitoring and discriminating co-epidemic diseases and pests at regional scales are of practical importance in guiding differential treatment. A combination of vegetation and environmental parameters could improve the accuracy for discriminating crop diseases and pests. Different diseases and pests could cause similar stresses and symptoms during the same crop growth period, so combining growth period information can be useful for discerning different changes in crop diseases and pests. Additionally, problems associated with imbalanced data often have detrimental effects on the performance of image classification. In this study, we developed an approach for discriminating crop diseases and pests based on bi-temporal Landsat-8 satellite imagery integrating both crop growth and environmental parameters. As a case study, the approach was applied to data during a period of typical co-epidemic outbreak of winter wheat powdery mildew and aphids in the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei Province, China. Firstly, bi-temporal remotely sensed features characterizing growth indices and environmental factors were calculated based on two Landsat-8 images. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm was used to resample the imbalanced training data set before model construction. Then, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) based on a new training data set balanced by the SMOTE approach (SMOTE-BPNN) was developed to generate the regional wheat disease and pest distribution maps. The original training data set-based BPNN and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used for comparison and testing of the initial results. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach incorporating both growth and environmental parameters of different crop periods could distinguish wheat powdery mildew and aphids at the regional scale. The bi-temporal growth indices and environmental factors-based SMOTE-BPNN, BPNN, and SVM models all had an overall accuracy high than 80%. Meanwhile, the SMOTE-BPNN method had the highest G-means among the three methods. These results revealed that the combination of bi-temporal crop growth and environmental parameters is essential for improving the accuracy of the crop disease and pest discriminating models. The combination of SMOTE and BPNN could effectively improve the discrimination accuracy of the minor disease or pest.

AB The objective of this work was to assess sugarcane area mapping using six-year-old time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the Vegetation sensor on board of the "systeme pour l'observation de la Terre" (SPOT) satellite. Three land cover classes (sugarcane, pasture, and forest), from the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were selected as reference spectral-temporal signatures, which were used as endmembers for spectral classification with the algorithm spectral angle mapper (SAM). Based on this classification, sugarcane areas were mapped by applying thresholds on the sugarcane rule image from the SAM, generated from values from the reference spectra. Results show that the SAM algorithm can be applied to time series of moderate resolution multi-temporal data, allowing for the efficient mapping of an agricultural crop in a mesoregional scale. Official data from sugarcane areas for the microregions of the state of Sao Paulo are well correlated (r(2) = 0.8) with the data obtained with the evaluated method. SAM is a useful algorithm for time series analysis. NDVI time series from the SPOT Vegetation sensor can be used for low-resolution sugarcane area mapping.

AB Soil drainage constitutes a substantial factor affecting plant growth and various biophysical processes, such as nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. Consequently, soil drainage maps represent crucial tools for crop, forest and environmental management purposes. As extensive field surveys are time- and resource-consuming, alternative spatial modelling techniques have been previously applied for predicting soil drainage classes. The present study assessed the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for mapping soil drainage classes in Denmark and compared it to a Decision Tree Classification (DTC) technique. 1702 soil observations and 31 environmental variables, including soil and terrain parameters, and spectral indices derived from satellite images, were utilized as input data. Based on a 33% holdback validation dataset, the best performing ANN and DTC models yielded overall accuracy values of 54 and 52%, respectively. DTC models benefited from the use of all variables, but ANN models performed better after variable selection. Notably, ANN and DTC model performances were comparable although differential costs for misclassification were only implemented for DTC modelling. Nevertheless, both methods produced predictive drainage maps in accordance with one another and demonstrated promising classification abilities over a large study area (c. 43,000 km(2)).

AB Salinization is a major soil degradation threat in irrigated systems worldwide. Irrigated systems in the Niger River basin are also affected by salinity, but its spatial distribution and intensity are not currently known. The aim of this study was to develop a method to detect salt-affected soils in irrigated systems. Two complementary approaches were tested: salinity assessment of bare soils using a salinity index (SI) and monitoring of indirect effects of salinity on rice growth using temporal series of a vegetation index (NDVI). The study area was located south of Niamey (Niger) in two irrigated systems of rice paddy fields that cover 6.5 km(2). We used remote-sensing and ground-truth data to relate vegetation behavior and reflectance to soil characteristics. We explored all existing Sentinel-2 images from January 2016 to December 2019 and selected cloud-free images on 157 dates that covered eight successive rice-growing seasons. In the dry season of 2019, we also sampled 44 rice fields, collecting 147 biomass samples and 180 topsoil samples from January to June. For each field and growing season, time-integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI) was estimated, and the SI was calculated for dates on which bare soil conditions (NDVI < 0.21) prevailed. Results showed that since there were few periods of bare soil, SI could not differentiate salinity classes. In contrast, the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 images enabled us to describe rice-growing conditions over time. In 2019, TI-NDVI and crop yields were strongly correlated (r = 0.77 with total biomass yield and 0.82 with grain yield), while soil electrical conductivity was negatively correlated with both TI-NDVI (r = -0.38) and crop yield (r = -0.23 with total biomass and r = -0.29 with grain yield). Considering the TI-NDVI data from 2016-2019, principal component analysis followed by ascending hierarchical classification identified a typology of five clusters with different patterns of TI-NDVI during the eight growing seasons. When applied to the entire study area, this classification clearly identified the extreme classes (i.e., areas with high or no salinity). Other classes with low TI-NDVI (i.e., during dry seasons) may be related to areas with moderate or seasonal soil salinity. Finally, the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 images enabled us to detect stresses on vegetation that occurred repeatedly over the growing seasons, which may be good indicators of soil constraints due to salinity in the context of the irrigated paddy systems of Niger. Further research will validate the ability of the method developed to detect moderate soil salinity constraints over large areas.

AB The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) EROS (Earth Resources Observation System) Data Center's (EDC) 1-km classified land cover data are combined with other land use data using a Geographic Information System (GIS) to create the Biogenic Emissions Landcover Database (BELD). The land cover data are being used to estimate biogenic emissions in the contiguous United States. These emissions include volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from vegetation and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. The EDC data are used predominately in the western United States, while other sources, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Census of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service Eastwide Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (EWDB), are used in the eastern United States. The EROS Data Center land cover classifications must be used with caution in heterogenous areas. Emission factors vary drastically by specific crop and tree genera, and mixed classes in the EDC scheme may not always accurately reflect the actual crop/genus mix. However, future use of satellite-derived vegetation indices and other land cover characteristics may prove useful in understanding geographic distributions of foliar mass and seasonal variation in Leaf Area Index (LAI), which are important drivers in biogenic emission models.

AB Identifying the location of irrigated croplands and how they change over time is critical for assessing and managing limited water resources to navigate such challenges as local to global water scarcity, increasing demands for food and energy production, and environmental sustainability. Although efforts have been made to map irrigated area for the U.S., multi-year nationwide maps at field-relevant resolutions are still unavailable; existing products suffer from coarse resolution, uncertain accuracy, and/or limited spatial coverage, especially in the eastern U.S. In this study, we present an approach to map the extent of irrigated croplands across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for each year in the period of 1997-2017. To scale nationwide, we developed novel methods to generate training datasets covering both the western and eastern U.S. For the more arid western U.S., we built upon the methods of Xie et al. (2019) and further developed a greenness-based normalization technique to estimate optimal thresholds of crop greenness in any year based on those in USDA NASS census years (i.e., 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017). For the relatively humid eastern states, we collected data on the current status of center pivot irrigated and non-irrigated fields and extended these sample points through time using various indices and observational thresholds. We used the generated samples along with remote sensing features and environmental variables to train county-stratified random forest classifiers annually for pixel-level classification of irrigated extent each year and subsequently implemented a logic-based post-classification filtering. The produced Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID-US) accurately reconstructed NASS irrigation patterns at both the county and state level while also supplying new annual area estimates for intra-epoch years. Nationwide pixel-level locational assessment further demonstrated an overall accuracy above 90% across years. In the 21year study period, we found several hotspots of irrigation change including significant gains in the U.S. Midwest, the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain, and the East Coast as well as irrigation declines in the central and southern High Plains Aquifer and the southern California Central Valley, Arizona, and Florida. The resulting 30 m resolution LANID-US products represent the finest resolution account of nationwide irrigation use and dynamics across the United States to date. The developed approach, training data, and products are further extendable to other years (either before 1997 or after 2017) for continuous monitoring of irrigated area over CONUS and are spatially applicable to other regions with similar climate and cropping landscapes.

AB Rice cultivation has been recognized as one of the major anthropogenic source for CH 4 emissions. A rule-based classification approach and parameter selection approach is available for rice mapping in which the rules and parameters are derived from agronomic knowledge of the rice crop and its management. SAR-based operational mapping of rice crop across a diverse range of environments is possible with the increasing availability multi-temporal Sentinel 1A satellite data at VV polarisation with 20m spatial resolution was acquired and processed using MAP scape-RICE software. Precise estimation of methane emission from rice fields at regional scale depends on accurate assessment of rice area and MODIS derived LST T factors were used for spatial estimation of methane emission from Tiruchirapalli district and compared with field level estimates. The total rice area in Tiruchirapalli district was 36127 hectare during rabi season 2015-16. The rate of LST based methane emission ranged from 35.36 to 48.17 kg/ha in Tiruchirapalli district. The total methane emission from Tiruchirapalli district based on LST based T factor was 1.5706Gg during the season. MODIS derived LST T factor along with SAR based rice area can be used as a tool for precise and near real time assessment of methane emission at regional or country level.

AB Orthomosaics derived from consumer grade digital cameras on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring and remote sensing of the environment. To have lasting quantitative value, remotely sensed imagery should be calibrated to physical units of reflectance. Radiometric calibration improves the quality of raw imagery for consistent quantitative analysis and comparison across different calibrated imagery. Moreover, calibrating remotely sensed imagery to units of reflectance improves its usefulness for deriving quantitative biochemical and biophysical metrics. Notwithstanding the existing radiometric calibration procedures for correcting single images, studies on radiometric calibration of UAV-derived orthomosaics remain scarce. In particular, this study presents a cost- and time-efficient radiometric calibration framework for designing calibration targets, checking scene illumination uniformity, converting orthomosaic digital numbers to units of reflectance, and accuracy assessment using in situ mean reflectance measurements (i.e. the average reflectance in a particular waveband). The empirical line method was adopted for the development of radiometric calibration prediction equations using mean reflectance values measured in only one spot within a 97 ha orthomosaic for three wavebands, i.e. red, green and blue of the Sony NEX-7 camera. A scene illumination uniformity check experiment was conducted to establish whether 10 randomly distributed regions within the orthomosaic experienced similar atmospheric and illumination conditions. This methodological framework was tested in a relatively flat terrain semi-arid woodland that is invaded by Harrisia pomanensis (the Midnight Lady). The scene illumination uniformity check results showed that at a 95% confidence interval, the prediction equations developed using mean reflectance values measured from only one spot within the scene can be used to calibrate the entire 97 ha RGB orthomosaic. Furthermore, the radiometric calibration accuracy assessment results showed a correlation coefficient r value of 0.977 (p<0.01) between measured and estimated reflectance values with an overall root mean square error of 0.063. These findings suggest that given the entire scene being mapped is experiencing similar atmospheric and illumination conditions, then prediction equations developed using mean reflectance values measured in only one spot within the scene can be used to calibrate the entire orthomosaic in semi-arid woodlands. The proposed methodological framework can potentially be tested and adapted for use in large-scale crop mapping and monitoring in precision agriculture, land-use/land-cover classification as well as plant species delimitation, particularly for mapping widespread invasive alien plants such as H. pomanensis.

AB Conservation tillage methods through leaving the crop residue cover (CRC) on the soil surface protect it from water and wind erosions. Hence, the percentage of the CRC on the soil surface is very critical for the evaluation of tillage intensity. The objective of this study was to develop a new methodology based on the semiautomated fuzzy object based image analysis (fuzzy OBIA) and compare its efficiency with two machine learning algorithms which include: support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the evaluation of the previous CRC and tillage intensity. We also considered the spectral images from two remotely sensed platforms of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2 satellite, respectively. The results indicated that fuzzy OBIA for multispectral Sentinel-2 image based on Gaussian membership function with overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa of 0.920 and 0.874, respectively, surpassed machine learning algorithms and represented the useful results for the classification of tillage intensity. The results also indicated that overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa for the classification of RGB images from the UAV using fuzzy OBIA method were 0.860 and 0.779, respectively. The semiautomated fuzzy OBIA clearly outperformed machine learning approaches in estimating the CRC and the classification of the tillage methods and also it has the potential to substitute or complement field techniques.

AB Time series of multi-spectral satellite data are a valuable option for crop-area monitoring, in particular by enabling rapid, accurate, and consistent estimation of crop area. In this study, we demonstrate the use of a turn-key wheat area mapping model using growing season Landsat time-series data to improve the precision of area estimates produced from a sample of field locations at which the presence of percent wheat per sample pixel was determined. The strata used in the sampling design to obtain the current season's in-situ reference data were created from a wheat map of the previous growing season. We then used a map for the current growing season to serve as an auxiliary variable in a regression estimator of the wheat area. This approach allows for rapid production of such maps and area estimates with less demand for technical expertise in an ongoing wheat monitoring system. Our automated, turn-key classification-tree algorithm produced wheat maps with comparable overall accuracy to those achieved by traditional supervised classification using manual training data collection. Pixel counts from turn-key maps for the years 2013 to 2017 over-estimated wheat area by 0.86% in 2014 to 7.26% in 2017 when compared to the official estimate from the Punjab Crop Reporting Service. Of the several approaches to estimating wheat area were compared, stratified random and simple random sampling augmented by a regression estimator were the two that yielded the smallest standard errors. Incorporating a current season, turn-key map in a regression estimator with data from a simple random sampling design represents a methodologically straightforward, operational implementation of timely, accurate, and precise monitoring of wheat area. Given the importance of wheat production in Punjab to Pakistan's national economy, this method represents an operationally efficient and effective monitoring of inter-annual shortages or surpluses in support of grain management. An automated, turn-key winter wheat mapping algorithm enables timely area estimation in advance of harvest.

AB The mapping of cropland helps to make decisions due to the intensification of its use, where the conditions of the crops change due to climatic variability and other socio-economic factors. In this way, the implementation of modern sustainable agriculture is essential to prevent soil degradation as measures to guarantee food security, propose sustainable rural development and protect the provision of different ecosystem services associated with the soil. NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICES at-2) launched September 15, 2018, offers new possibilities for the mapping of global terrain and vegetation. An additional science objective is to measure vegetation canopy height as a basis for estimating large-scale biomass and biomass change. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICES at-2 utilizes a photon-counting LIDAR and ancillary systems (GPS and star cameras) to measure the time a photon takes to travel from ATLAS to Earth and back again and to determine the photon's geodetic latitude and longitude. ICES at-2 ATL08 (Along-Track-Level) data product is developed for vegetation mapping with algorithms for along-track elevation profile of terrain and canopy heights retrieval of the from ATLAS point clouds. Thus, this study presents a brief look at the ATL08 product highlight the broad capability of the satellite for vegetation applications working with data of study area Seis de Julio de Cuellaje (SDJC), province of Imbabura, Ecuador. The study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by the year 2020 time-series at 30 m resolution by employing a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The results of this research indicate that the ATL08 data from the ICES at-2 product provide estimates of canopy height, show the potential for crop biomass estimation, and a machine learning land cover classification approach with a precision of 95.57% with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data.

AB Identifying and monitoring the heavy metal pollution information of crops isthe research focus by hyperspectral remote sensing technology today. The potted corn experiments were set up with different Cu2+ and Pb2+ stress gradients in this research, measuring the spectral data, the content of heavy metals icon and chlorophyll of corn leaves. On the basis of the collected data, the spectra were divided into six spectral characteristic intervals: purple vallley, blue edge, green peak, red valley, red edge and red shoulder, and spectral characteristic intervals were transformed and analyzed by spatial spectrum, which was constructed by first order differential and 2D multiple signal classification (2D-MUSIC) algorithm. The analyzed and processed results show, the spatial spectra of the array signals of the blue edge, green peak and red edge are double peaks under Cu2+ stress. However, the spatial spectra of the array signals of the blue edge, green peak and red edge were single peak under Pb2+ stress. Thus, the heavy metals elements categories of Cu2+ and Pb2+ in polluted corn could be quickly and visually distinguished. Azimuth spectrum peaks of array signal spatial spectra of red valley and red shoulder were gradually decreased under Cu2+ stress, and the correlation coefficients of azimuth spectrum peak values of red valley and red shoulder and the Cu2+ contents in corn leaves reached -0. 954 5 and -0. 964 8. It was indicated that the effect was ideal when monitoring the level of Cu2+ pollution; azimuth spectrum peaks of array signal spatial spectrum of purple valley were gradually decreased under Pb2+ stress, and the correlation coefficient of azimuth spectrum peak value of purple vallley and the Pb2+ contents in corn leaves reached 0. 999 8, it was indicated that the effect was ideal when the level of Pb2+ pollution was monitored. At the same time, the application results of the spatial spectrum were analyzed and compared with the results obtained by some conventional methods such as green-peak height (GH), red edge position (REP), maximum-value of red-edge (MR) and first-derivative area of red-edge (FAR) for monitoring the crop heavy metal pollution information, the spatial spectrum theory was verified to have better effectiveness and superiority in monitoring heavy metal pollution information of the corn leaves.

AB Many challenges prevail in cropland mapping over large areas, including dealing with massive volumes of datasets and computing capabilities. Accordingly, new opportunities have been opened at a breakneck pace with the launch of new satellites, the continuous improvements in data retrieval technology, and the upsurge of cloud computing solutions such as Google Earth Engine (GEE). Therefore, the present work is an attempt to automate the extraction of multi-year (2016-2020) cropland phenological metrics on GEE and use them as inputs with environmental covariates in a trained machine-learning model to generate high-resolution cropland and crop field-probabilities maps in Morocco. The comparison of our phenological retrievals against the MODIS phenology product shows very close agreement, implying that the suggested approach accurately captures crop phenology dynamics, which allows better cropland classification. The entire country is mapped using a large volume of reference samples collected and labelled with a visual interpretation of high-resolution imagery on Collect-Earth-Online, an online platform for systematically collecting geospatial data. The cropland classification product for the nominal year 2019-2020 showed an overall accuracy of 97.86% with a Kappa of 0.95. When compared to Morocco's utilized agricultural land (SAU) areas, the cropland probabilities maps demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate sub-national SAU areas with an R-value of 0.9. Furthermore, analyzing cropland dynamics reveals a dramatic decrease in the 2019-2020 season by 2% since the 2018-2019 season and by 5% between 2016 and 2020, which is partly driven by climate conditions, but even more so by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that impacted the planting and managing of crops due to government measures taken at the national level, like complete lockdown. Such a result proves how much these methods and associated maps are critical for scientific studies and decision-making related to food security and agriculture.

   CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; GENESIS
AB A land surface map of the region of Niamey (2-3 degrees E, 13-14 degrees N), Niger, derived from a classification of SPOT multispectral satellite data with 20 x 20-m resolution, is described. Sixteen distinct classes were defined based on landform, vegetation soil crust type and land use. The classification system was designed to emphasize the role of these factors in hydrological and ecological processes. The primary purpose was to provide information for integrating local-scale measurements of land-atmosphere interactions in HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) up to a region 1 degrees x 1 degrees square, and to assist hydrologists in interpreting the spatial distribution of soil moisture. A large number of ground descriptions were integrated with high spatial resolution multispectral satellite reflectance data. Since most of the hydrological and atmospheric observations in HAPEX-Sahel were carried out in only three land cover types (tiger bush on the plateaux, fallow savanna and millet fields in the sand valley or plains), the 16 classes were merged successively into nine then six so that three final maps were produced, each one reflecting a different degree of aggregation.
   Some difficulties could not be resolved. One stemmed from the continuum linking land left fallow and cultivation. This uncertainty can be a problem since bush-fallow and cropped fields are hydrologically and ecologically quite distinct. Another major difficulty was the detection of sparse vegetation cover using the satellite data.
   Each surface condition class was assigned a range of runoff capability parameters derived from numerous rainfall simulation tests conducted in the Sahelian zone. Consequently, runoff production could be assessed for each 20 x 20-m pixel. However, due to the endoreic nature of the watersheds in the region, the use of the map to predict runoff production must be restricted to small areas ranging from the pixel size to catchments of 1-10 km(2).

AB Rivers play an essential role to humans and ecosystems, but they also burst their banks during floods, often causing extensive damage to crop, property, and loss of lives. This paper characterizes the 2014 flood of the Indus River in Pakistan using the US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Centre River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model, integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) and satellite images from Landsat-8. The model is used to estimate the spatial extent of the flood and assess the damage that it caused by examining changes to the different land-use/land-cover (LULC) types of the river basin. Extreme flows for different return periods were estimated using a flood frequency analysis using a log-Pearson III distribution, which the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test identified as the best distribution to characterize the flow regime of the Indus River at Taunsa Barrage. The output of the flood frequency analysis was then incorporated into the HEC-RAS model to determine the spatial extent of the 2014 flood, with the accuracy of this modelling approach assessed using images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results show that a supervised classification of the Landsat images was able to identify the LULC types of the study region with a high degree of accuracy, and that the most affected LULC was crop/agricultural land, of which 50% was affected by the 2014 flood. Finally, the hydraulic simulation of extent of the 2014 flood was found to visually compare very well with the MODIS image, and the surface area of floods of different return periods was calculated. This paper provides further evidence of the benefit of using a hydrological model and satellite images for flood mapping and for flood damage assessment to inform the development of risk mitigation strategies.

AB Applications in which researchers aim to extract a single land type from remotely sensed data are quite common in practical scenarios: extract the urban footprint to make connections with socio-economic factors; map the forest extent to subsequently retrieve biophysical variables and detect a particular crop type to successively calibrate and deploy yield prediction models. In this scenario, the (positive) targeted class is well defined, while the negative class is difficult to describe. This one-class classification setting is also referred to as positive unlabelled learning (PUL) in the general field of machine learning. To deal with this challenging setting, when satellite image time series data are available, we propose a new framework named positive and unlabelled learning of satellite image time series (PUL-SITS). PUL-SITS involves two different stages: In the first one, a recurrent neural network autoencoder is trained to reconstruct only positive samples with the aim to higight reliable negative ones. In the second stage, both labelled and unlabelled samples are exploited in a semi-supervised manner to build the final binary classification model. To assess the quality of our approach, experiments were carried out on a real-world benchmark, namely Haute-Garonne, located in the southwest area of France. From this study site, we considered two different scenarios: a first one in which the process has the objective to map Cereals/Oilseeds cover versus the rest of the land cover classes and a second one in which the class of interest is the Forest land cover. The evaluation was carried out by comparing the proposed approach with recent competitors to deal with the considered positive and unlabelled learning scenarios.

AB ADAS, a land and environment consultancy, is responsible for monitoring various government funded agri-environment schemes and satellite imagery is increasingly one of the data sources being used in this task. Current research has examined how ERS Tandem imagery can be used to provide information on land management and crop establishment over the autumn and winter. In winter, catchments are most at risk from nitrate leaching after soils return to full water saturation. Research has shown that ploughing in the autumn (rather than direct drilling) increases nitrate leaching and that an autumn sown crop or winter cover can decrease nitrate leaching. Thus during winter, the area and location of bare soil (particularly ploughed land) influences the degree of nitrate leaching. To successfully model nitrate movements over over catchments requires various parameters including information on the area and location of various land cover types, the presence and degree of ground cover of winter crops and the location of bare land (including evidence of whether this land has been cultivated). To river model requires nitrate various
   InSAR processing of 4 ERS Tandem pairs from 1995 was used to produce gee-coded multi temporal coherence and intensity images for an area of the Rivers Leam, Cherwell and Great Ouse Nitrate Vulnerable Zone in England. Thematic information derived from these images has been compared with a SPOT XS image and farmer's records collected after the ERS acquisitions. Analysis has shown that the potential for discriminating land cover and bare soil conditions is best achieved by combining multi-temporal coherence and intensity images. Data compression techniques have been used to reduce the thematic information into three channels. Pixel based classification has then been used to map autumn/winter land cover, including identifying cultivated bare soil and variation in the degree of establishment of autumn sown crops.

AB The study assesses the extent and trends of forest cover in Southeast Asia for the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 and provides an overview on the main causes of forest cover change. A systematic sample of 418 sites (10 kmx10 km size) located at the one-degree geographical confluence points and covered with satellite imagery of 30 m resolution is used for the assessment. Techniques of image segmentation and automated classification are combined with visual satellite image interpretation and quality control, involving forestry experts from Southeast Asian countries. The accuracy of our results is assessed through an independent consistency assessment, performed from a subsample of 1572 mapping units and resulting in an overall agreement of >85% for the general differentiation of forest cover versus non-forest cover. The total forest cover of Southeast Asia is estimated at 268 Mha in 1990, dropping to 236 Mha in 2010, with annual change rates of 1.75 Mha (similar to 0.67 %) and 1.45 Mha (similar to 0.59 %) for the periods 1990-2000 and 20002010, respectively. The vast majority of forest cover loss (similar to 2/3 for 2000-2010) occurred in insular Southeast Asia. Complementing our quantitative results by indicative information on patterns and on processes of forest change, obtained from the screening of satellite imagery and through expert consultation, respectively, confirms the conversion of forest to cash crops plantations (including oil palm) as the main cause of forest loss in Southeast Asia. Logging and the replacement of natural forests by forest plantations are two further important change processes in the region.

AB In this study, the capability of crop water stress index (CWSI) based on satellite thermal infrared data for estimating water stress and irrigation scheduling in sugarcane fields was evaluated. For this purpose, eight Landsat 8 satellite images were acquired during the sugarcane growing season (May-September 2015). Simultaneous with the satellite overpass times, in-situ measurements of canopy temperature and vegetation water content (VWC) were conducted in forty points located in eight sugarcane fields per image (in total 320 observation points in 32 fields). These fields were selected with different ages (Plant, Ratoon 1, Ratoon 2, and Ratoon 3) and irrigation schedule. Then, the CWSI was calculated in three different ways including: 1) based on the Idso method and using the handheld infrared thermometer, 2) based on the Idso method and thermal infrared data of Landsat 8 satellite imagery, 3) using a new proposed procedure for retrieving CWSI from the satellite imagery with using the hot and cold pixels. Results show a good relationship between the calculated CWSI based on field measurement and new CWSI based on satellite data with the coefficient of determination of 0.49-0.85 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12-0.29 for different images. Further, a negative relationship between VWC and CWSI, with R-2 values of 0.42-0.78, was observed. This relationship increases with developing sugarcane canopy, and decreases with an increasing plant age. Comparing recorded irrigation events in the fields, estimated CWSI and VWC shows that water stress can be classified into three critical classes including high water stress (0.70 <VWC < 0.75), medium water stress (0.75 <VWC< 0.8), and low stress (0.8 < VWC < 0.85). This classification can be used as a part of an operational procedure for appropriate irrigation scheduling. All of the aforementioned results indicate that the CWSI based on the proposed approach in this study can be used effectively for monitoring water stress and irrigation scheduling in sugarcane fields using satellite imagery without any need for ground ancillary data.

AB Soil provides crop with nutrients, water and root support. But, soils vary a great deal in terms of origin, appearance, characteristics and production capacity. Better understanding of the causality between yield and yield-limiting soil factor(s) is essential for site-specific crop management. The objectives of this study were deriving a spatiotemporal yield trend map of a 144 km(2) paddy rice growing region located at an alluvial plain in southwestern Taiwan from satellite images and exploring the potential yield-limiting soil factor(s) in conjunction with general soil survey data. Due to the complexity of data sets, classification and regression trees analysis (CART) was used to relate soil characteristics to yield classes in the spatiotemporal yield trend map, and followed by comparisons of soil characteristics between those consistently-high and -low yielding areas to explore the interactions between yields and soil properties. Through the above data mining analysis, high soil pH, severe leaching loss of applied nitrogen fertilizers, and excessive reductive root environment were suspected to be the major soil related low-yielding mechanisms spread within studied region. Soil characteristics that induced these low-yielding mechanisms were identified and mapped. Error analysis indicated that 61.8 % of the consistently low-yield areas could be correctly identified by just a few soil characteristics. Improvements of management practices to alleviate the negative effects on yields were also proposed based on the identified low yielding mechanisms. Our study highlighted the pressing need and possible methodologies to adjust management strategies for narrowing yield variability and increasing crop production.

AB Roads and roadsides provide dispersal channels for non-native invasive alien plants (IAP), many of which hold devastating impacts in the economy, human health, biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. Remote sensing is an essential tool for efficiently assessing and monitoring the dynamics of IAP along roads. In this study, we explore the potentialities of object based image analysis (OBIA) approach to map several invasive plant species along roads using very high spatial resolution imagery. We compared the performance of OBIA approaches implemented in one open source software (OTB/Monteverdi) against those available in two proprietary pro-grams (eCognition and ArcGIS). We analysed the images by two sequential processes. First, we obtained a land-cover map for 15 study sites by segmenting the images with the algorithms Mean Shift Segmentation (MSS) and Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS), and by classifying the segmented images with the algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Neighbour Classifier (NNC) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). We created a mask using the polygons classified as non-vegetation to crop the images of the 15 study sites. Second, we repeated the previous segmentation and classification steps over the 15 masked images of vegetated areas using the same algorithms. OTB/Monteverdi, with MSS and SVM algorithms, showed to be a good software for land-cover mapping (OA = 87.0%), as well as ArcGIS, with MSS and MLC algorithms (OA = 84.3%). However, these two programs, using the same segmentation algorithms, did not achieve good accuracy results when mapping IAP species (OA(OTB/Monteverdi) = 63.3%; OAA(cos = 45.7%). eCognition, with MRS and NNC algorithms, reached better classification results in both land-cover and IAP maps (OA(Land-cover )= 95.7%; OA(Invasive-plant )= 92.8%). 'Bare soil' and 'Road', and 'A. donax' were the classes with best and worst overall accuracy, respectively, when mapping land-cover classes in the three programs. 'Other trees' was the class with the most accurate and significant differences in the three programs when mapping IAP species. The separation of each invasive species should be improved with a phenology-based design of field surveys. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of sequential segmentation and classification of RS data for mapping and monitoring plant invasions along linear infrastructures, which allows to reduce the time, cost and hazard of extensive field campaigns along roadsides.

AB Declining crop and livestock production due to a degrading land resource base and changing climate among other biophysical and socio-economic constraints, is increasingly forcing rural households in Zimbabwe and other parts of Southern Africa to rely on common natural resource pools (CNRPs) to supplement their household food and income. Between 2011 and 2013, we combined farmer participatory research approaches, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to (1) understand the contribution of CNRPs to household food and income in Dendenyore and Ushe smallholder communities in Hwedza District, eastern Zimbabwe and (2) assess changes of the CNRPs in both space and time, and their implications on climate change adaptation. Across study sites, wetlands and woodlands were ranked as the most important CNRPs. Extraction and use patterns of products from the different pools differed among households of different resource endowment. Resource-constrained households (RG3) sold an average of 183 kg household(-1) year(-1) of wild loquats fruits (Uapaca kirkiana), realising about US$48, while resource-endowed farmers (RG1) had no need to sale any. The RG3 households also realised approximately US$70 household(-1) year(-1) from sale of crafts made from water reeds (Phragmites mauritianus). Empirical data closely supported communities' perceptions that CNRPs had declined significantly in recent years compared with two to three decades ago. More than 60 % of the respondents perceived that the availability of natural resources drawn from wetlands and woodlands, often used for food, energy and crafts, has decreased markedly since the 1980s. Classification of land cover in a GIS environment indicated that CNRPs declined between 1972 and 2011, supporting farmers' perceptions. Overall, woodlands declined by 37 % in both communities, while the total area under wetlands decreased by 29 % in Ushe, a drier area and 49 % in Dendenyore, a relatively humid area. The over-reliance in CNRPs by rural communities could be attributed to continued decline in crop yields linked to increased within-season rainfall variability, and the absence of alternative food and income sources. This suggests limited options for rural communities to adapt to the changing food production systems in the wake of climate change and variability and other challenges such as declining soil fertility. There is therefore a need to design adaptive farm management options that enhance both crop and livestock production in a changing climate as well as identifying other livelihood alternatives outside agriculture to reduce pressure on CNRPs. In addition, promotion of alternative sources of energy such as solar power and biogas among rural communities could reduce the cutting of trees for firewood from woodlands.

AB In the context of growing populations and limited resources, the sustainable intensification of agricultural production is of great importance to achieve food security. As the need to support management at a range of spatial scales grows, decision-support tools appear increasingly important to enable the timely and regular assessment of agricultural production over large areas and identify priorities for improving crop production in low-productivity regions. Understanding productivity patterns requires the timely provision of gapless, spatial information about agricultural productivity. In this study, dense 30-m time series covering the 2004-2014 period were generated from Landsat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images over the irrigated cropped area of the Fergana Valley, Central Asia. A light-use efficiency model was combined with machine learning classifiers to assess the crop yield at the field level. The classification accuracy of land cover maps reached 91% on average. Crop yield and acreage estimates were in good agreement (R-2=0.812 and 0.871, respectively) with reported yields and acreages at the district level. Several indicators of cropland intensity and productivity were derived on a per-field basis and used to highlight homogeneous regions in terms of productivity by means of clustering. Results underlined that regions with lower water-use efficiency were not only located further away from irrigation canals and intake points, but also had limited access to markets and roads. The results underline that yield could be increased by roughly 1.0 and 1.4t/ha for cotton and wheat, respectively, if the access to water would be optimized in some of the regions. The minimum calibration requirement of the method and the fusion of multi-sensor data are keys to cope with the constraints of operational crop monitoring and guarantee a sustained and timely delivery of the agricultural indicators to the user community. The results of this study can form the baseline to support regional land- and water-resource management.

AB Extreme drought events from climate disturbances are weakening livelihood and limiting agriculture and livestock production in the Sahel region. The lack of relevant information to anticipate coping measures has exacerbated impacts leading to climate adaptation failure in most parts. In this regard, the current research paper has collected important datasets with an objective to assess the impact of extreme drought events on household's livelihoods for better understanding impacts, local people's perception, and the changes on vegetation cover in order to support a robust adaptation strategy to drought. The study conducted a household survey and collected satellite data for comparative analysis. The first survey was conducted in 2013 to collect data from 465 household heads through a structured questionnaire. Supplementary focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted in 2018 to collect qualitative information from targeted respondents such as village leaders and members of other key groups including women and youth. Descriptive statistics and correlation coefficient matrix were used to characterize the impact on households' main livelihoods and logistic regression to predict people's perception on pasture depletion over the last 20 years. Satellite data were used to derive spectral vegetation of land covers and unsupervised classification indexes. Both individual survey and focus group discussions identified drought as the main climate constraint which reduced crop production, water and pastures. The logistic analysis revealed that if the respondent's major occupation is livestock, the probability to perceive a depletion of pasture will increase by 28%. Concurrently, the satellite image observation in perfect agreement with the field survey showed 6.78% and 6.01% losses of water surface and vegetation cover respectively between 1986 and 2016 in the study area. These findings showed that logistic regression coupled with satellite information can inform on past and future impacts which are extremely crucial for sound adaptation planning in the Sahel region.

AB The accuracy of a supervised image classification is a function of the training data used in its generation. It is, therefore, critical that the training stage of a supervised classification is designed to provide the necessary information. Guidance on the design of the training stage of a classification typically calls for the use of a large sample of randomly selected pure pixels in order to characterise the classes. Such guidance is generally made without regard to the specific nature of the application in-hand, including the classifier to be used. The design of the training stage should really be based on the classifier to be used since individual training cases can vary in value as can any one training set to a range of classifiers. It is argued here that the training stage can be designed on the basis of the way the classifier operates and with emphasis on the desire to separate the classes rather than describe them. An approach to the training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is the opposite of that generally promoted for training set design is suggested. This approach uses a small sample of mixed spectral responses drawn from purposefully selected locations (geographical boundaries) in training. The approach is based on mixed pixels which are normally masked-out of analyses as undesirable and problematic. A sample of such data should, however, be easier and cheaper to acquire than that suggested by conventional approaches. This new approach to training set design was evaluated against conventional approaches with a set of classifications of agricultural crops from satellite sensor data. The main result was that classifications derived from the use of the mixed spectral responses and the conventional approach did not differ significantly, with the overall accuracy of classifications generally similar to 92%.

AB More than 50% of the world's population consumes rice. Accurate and up-to-date information on rice field extent is important to help manage food and water security. Currently, field surveys or MODIS satellite data are used to estimate rice growing areas. This study presents a cost-effective methodology for near-real-time mapping and monitoring of rice growth extent and cropping patterns over a large area. This novel method produces high-resolution monthly maps (10 m resolution) of rice growing areas, as well as rice growth stages. The method integrates temporal Sentinel-1 data and rice phenological parameters with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform. It uses monthly median time series of Sentinel-1 at VH polarization from September 2016 to October 2018. The two study areas are the northern region of West Java, Indonesia (0.75 million ha), and the Kedah and Perlis states in Malaysia (over 1 million ha). K-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and a visual interpretation of VH polarization time series profiles are used to generate rice extent, cropping patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of growth stages. To automate the process, four supervised classification methods (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests, and C5.0 classification models) were independently trialled to identify cluster labels. The results from each classification method were compared. The method can also forecast rice extent for up to two months. The VH polarization data can identify four growth stages of rice-T&P: tillage and planting (30 days); V: vegetative-1 and 2 (60 days); R: reproductive (30 days); M: maturity (30 days). Compared to field survey data, this method measures overall rice extent with an accuracy of 96.5% and a kappa coefficient of 0.92. SVM and ANN show better performance than random forest and C5.0 models. This simple and robust method could be rolled out across Southeast Asia, and could be used as an alternative to time-consuming, expensive field surveys.

AB Manual digitizing on aerial photographs is still commonly used for characterizing gully erosion over large areas. Even when automated detection procedures are implemented, manual digitizing is frequently being resorted to in order to constitute reference datasets used for training and validation. In both cases, manual digitizing entails some subjective decisions on behalf of the operator, which introduces uncertainty into the resulting datasets. To assess the magnitude of this uncertainty, 11 experienced operators were asked to digitize and classify ephemeral gullies (EGs) on cropland following a standardized methodology. The resulting 11 datasets were compared in terms of number, type and location of EGs. Furthermore, for EGs located on a well-defined runoff flow concentration axis, the slope versus contributing area topographic thresholds required for initiating gully channels were assessed using four thresholding methods, and compared across the 11 datasets. The operators identified 259 different EGs. However, the number (52-139) and sum total length (8.9-23.7 km) of EGs varied widely across operators. Only 34% of the EGs were digitized by more than half of the operators, and 7% were identified by all. Identification of EGs located on a well-defined flow concentration axis proved least subjective. The longer the EG and the more fields the EG crossed, the larger the number of operators that were able to identify it. EGs were also most easily identified when located in sugar beet fields as compared to other crops. EG classification and topographic threshold lines were also found to be strongly operator-dependent. Quantile regression appeared to be one of the most robust thresholding methods. Operator subjectivity when digitizing EGs on orthophotographs introduces uncertainty that should be taken into account in future remote sensing-based studies of EG erosion whenever they rely, in part or in full, on manual photograph interpretation.

AB Water stress is one of the most important growth limiting factors in crop production. Several methods have been used to detect and evaluate the effect of water stress on plants. The use of remote sensing is deemed particularly and practically suitable for assessing water stress and implementing appropriate management strategies because it presents unique advantages of repeatability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness over the ground-based surveys for water stress detection. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the effect of water stress on sweet corn (Zea mays L.) using spectral indices and chlorophyll readings and 2) evaluate the reflectance spectra using the classification tree (CT) method for distinguishing water stress levels/severity. Spectral measurements and chlorophyll readings were taken on sweet corn exposed to four levels of water stress with 0,33,66 and 100 % of pot capacity (PC) before and after each watering time. The results demonstrated that reflectance in the red portion (600-700 mu) of the electromagnetic spectrum decreased and increased in the near infrared (NIR) region (700-900 nm) with the increasing field capacity of water level. Reflectance measured before the irrigation was generally higher than after irrigation in the NW region and lower in the red region. However, when the four levels of PC and before or after irrigation only were compared, reflectance spectra indicated that water stressed corn plants absorbed less light in the visible and more light in the NIR regions of the spectrum than the less water stressed and unstressed plants. There was a similar trend to reflectance behaviour of water stress levels using chlorophyll readings that decreased over time. The CT analysis revealed that water stress can be assessed and differentiated using chlorophyll readings and reflectance data when transformed into spectral vegetation indices.

AB Forest managers and nature conservationists rely on precise mapping of single trees from remote sensing data for efficient estimation of forest attributes. In recent years, additional quantification of dead wood in particular has garnered interest. However, tree-level approaches utilizing segmented single trees are still limited in accuracy and their application is therefore mostly restricted to research studies. Furthermore, the combined classification of presegmented single trees with respect to tree species and health status is important for practical use but has been insufficiently investigated so far. Therefore, we introduce Silvi-Net, an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fusing airborne lidar data and multispectral (MS) images for 3D object classification. First, we segment single 3D trees from the lidar point cloud, render multiple silhouette-like side-view images, and enrich them with calibrated laser echo characteristics. Second, projected outlines of the segmented trees are used to crop and mask the MS orthomosaic and to generate MS image patches for each tree. Third, we independently train two ResNet-18 networks to learn meaningful features from both datasets. This optimization process is based on pretrained CNN weights and recursive retraining of model parameters. Finally, the extracted features are fused for a final classification step based on a standard multi-layer perceptron and majority voting. We analyzed the network?s performance on data captured in two study areas, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ) and the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP). For both study areas, the lidar point density was approximately 55 points/m(2) and the ground sampling distance values of the true orthophotos were 10 cm (ChEZ) and 20 cm (BFNP). In general, the trained models showed high generalization capacity on independent test data, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.1% for the classification of pines, birches, alders, and dead trees (ChEZ) -and 91.5% for coniferous, deciduous, snags, and dead trees (BFNP). Interestingly, lidar-based imagery increased the OA by 2.5% (ChEZ) and 5.9% (BFNP) compared to experiments only utilizing MS imagery. Moreover, Silvi-Net also demonstrated superior OA compared to the baseline method PointNet++ by 11.3% (ChEZ) and 2.2% (BFNP). Overall, the effectiveness of our approach was proven using 2D and 3D datasets from two natural forest areas (400-530 trees/ha), acquired with different sensor models, and varying geometric and spectral resolution. Using the technique of transfer learning, Silvi-Net facilitates fast model convergence, even for datasets with a reduced number of samples. Consequently, operators can generate reliable maps that are of major importance in applications such as automated inventory and monitoring projects.

AB In the Ba river basin, the natural forest area has been decreasing and agriculture area has been increasing at an uneven rate for the last 30 years. Objective of this research is analysing the change in the agricultural and forest areas under the impact of socioeconomic activities in this basin. Landsat satellite images with a resolution of 30 m acquired from 1989 to 2019 were used to assess the changes. To enhance the classification speed of data, this research applied the online Google Earth Engine platform and GIS tools to process and edit results. The results showed that the largest decrease in forest area was from 1989-2000 (-159,000 ha) while the agricultural area increased the most in the period 2010-2017 with more than 176,000 ha. The main reasons of conversion forest land into agricultural land such as fruit trees and perennial industrial crops were the increasing of population and agricultural prices. Besides, the demand of electricity caused the deforestation for hydropower plantations.

AB Modeling deforestation has become increasingly important in analyzing the effects of land-cover change on ecosystems. A simulation model based on socioeconomic variables was developed and applied to a study area in Central Rondonia, Brazil over a 20 year time period. The simulation model integrates three submodels of settlement diffusion, land-use change, and ecological change and simulates the effects of colonization on deforestation by varying a number of parameters (e.g. immigration rates, crop productivity, soil quality). We have recently developed a Landsat-based logistic regression model of deforestation for the same study area in Central Rondonia, Brazil over the 20 year time period. The model incorporates five main parameters in predicting the amount of deforestation on individual farmer settlement lots. These parameters include proximity of a lot to nearest paved road (PPR); proximity of a lot to nearest secondary road (PSR); distance to the nearest forest/cleared edge (PFC); distance from a market center (DMC); distance from a major urban center (DUC). This study evaluates and compares the predictive capability of both the image based and integrated model using remote sensing analysis and field measurements. The percent cleared and spatial metrics of landscape pattern including the patch-per-unit area metric (PPU) and square pixel metric (SqP) are used to compare image classifications with model outputs. The logistic regression model performed better than the socioeconomic model in capturing the pattern and location of deforestation over time. Differences in clearing patterns in both models were attributed to local topography, farming obstacles, and stochastic elements of farming. Results of this study help demonstrate some of the advantages in the use of integrated socioeconomic/ecological models for predicting land-use change and will hopefully facilitate the development of integrated models that accurately simulate the processes of land clearing on a regional and global scale..

AB Land use and land cover changes over 1973-2017 period in peripheral Delhi were mapped based on digital classification of satellite data and their driving forces ascertained. Urban area expanded and agricultural area diminished at annual rates of 38.6% and 2.1%, respectively, during the 1973-2017 period. Urban expansion occurred more in scrub and sparse vegetation areas than in cultivated lands or ponds. Loss of cultivated land happened mostly due to abandonment of cropping and tree planting in farmhouses developed by the urban elites. Improvement in the state of forests in terms of their expansion as well as densification offsets their loss due to urbanisation, encroachment and logging. The increment in the green cover was due to strict enforcement of compensatory afforestation/forest conservation law, growing demand of ecotourism, emergence of tree-clad farmhouses and increased environmental awareness and surveillance. This research will help in comprehending policies favouring sustainable urban development.

AB Rice acreage estimation is a key aspect to guarantee food security and also important to support government agricultural subsidy system. In this paper, we explored a sophisticated method to improve rice estimation accuracy at county scale and we developed our approach with China Environment Satellite HJ-1A/B data in Hunan Province, a fragmented area with complex rice cropping patterns. Our approach improved the estimation accuracy by combing supervised and unsupervised classification upon decomposition of mixed pixels model, and the rice estimation results, validated by ground survey data, showed a close relationship (RMSE approximate to 3.40) with survey figures, the estimated accuracy (EA) reached 83.74% at county level according to the sub-pixel method, and the accuracy can be increased about 12% compared to the pure-pixel method. The results suggest that decomposition of mixed pixels method has great significance to the improvement of rice acreage estimation accuracy, and can be used in mountainous and broken planting area.

AB CoastSat is an open-source software toolkit written in Python that enables the user to obtain time-series of shoreline position at any sandy coastline worldwide from 30+ years (and growing) of publicly available satellite imagery. The toolkit exploits the capabilities of Google Earth Engine to efficiently retrieve Landsat and Sentinel-2 images cropped to any user-defined region of interest. The resulting images are pre-processed to remove cloudy pixels and enhance spatial resolution, before applying a robust and generic shoreline detection algorithm. This novel shoreline detection technique combines a supervised image classification and a sub-pixel resolution border segmentation to map the position of the shoreline with an accuracy of similar to 10 m. The purpose of CoastSat is to provide coastal managers, engineers and scientists a user-friendly and practical toolkit to monitor and explore their coastlines. The software is freely-available on GitHub (https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) and is accompanied by guided examples (Jupyter Notebook) plus step-by-step README documentation.

AB Emerging marine observation technologies provide new opportunities to learn about phytoplankton communities with greater spatiotemporal resolution. Autonomous vehicles enable real-time ocean data collection and communications over long durations, in varying sea states and at lower cost than crewed ships. The Jupiter Research Foundation is developing a novel device to obtain near real-time phytoplankton observations from a mobile unmanned platform. The Jupiter Autonomous Microscope (JAM) is an autonomous microscope imaging system that acquires, crops and geo-tags phytoplankton images and sends them to a shore-based server via mobile phone or satellite networks. On-shore processing includes automated object measurements and classification, as well as statistical calculations. Images and corresponding data are made accessible on a dedicated website that allows filtering, annotation and sharing. Successfully deployed on Wave Gliders for several weeks at a time, JAM provides a unique view of phytoplankton community structure. This paper describes the overall JAM design and operation.

AB Basic terms, including "land use" and "land cover" are defined. Land use patterns are seen as a result of long-term interaction between humans and natural environment. Practical applications of land use research are discussed, namely with regard to land management and policy and land use planning. Later, the history of land use in the world is outlined. Four scientists that contributed most to land use research in the past are mentioned. First, Johann Heinrich von Thunen, who formulated the intensity theory and theory of crop zones. Second, Karl Marx, author of the term "differential ground rent". Third, British geographer L. D. Stamp who is considered founder of modern land use research. Last, but not least, the Polish geographer J. Kostrowicki who focused on typology and classification of agricultural systems in the second half of the twentieth century. Current approaches in land use research in the world are also discussed. Special attention is given to the DPSIR model that works with "drivers" and "pressures", "impacts" and "responses". The multi-level explanatory scheme, formulated by Scottish geographer A. Mather, is seen as the most complex concept used in land use research so far. Mather worked with proximate, intermediate, and underlying factors and he is also the author of the "forest transition" concept. In Czechia, the first research projects focused on land use were carried out in the early 1960s. At the moment there are two main research directions: analyses of small areas, and complex land use studies carried out by the so-called "Prague school". The latter studies often span a long period of time, starting in late eighteenth century. Old maps are utilized for comparisons; recently also remote sensing data have become available.

AB Wide mode SAR images have an apparent incidence angle effect. The existing incident angle normalization methods assume that the relationship between the incident angle (theta) and the backscattering coefficient (sigma(PQ)) does not change with the growth stage of crops, which is in conflict with the real-life situation. Therefore, the normalization results of sigma(PQ) based on these existing methods will affect the accuracy of object classification, target recognition, and land surface parameter inversion. Here, the change in theta-sigma(PQ) relationship was investigated based on time-series (April to October) sigma(PQ) of maize canopies in northeast China, and a dynamic method based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was developed to normalize the effect of theta on sigma(PQ). Through the accuracy evaluation, the following conclusions are obtained: (1) the dependence (referring to N) of Sentinel 1 C-band sigma(PQ) on theta varies with maize NDVI. In addition, the value of N changed from 9.35 to 0.66 at VV polarization from bare soil to biomass peak, and from 6.26 to 0.99 at VH polarization; (2) a dynamic method was proposed to quantify the change of N based on its strong correlation with NDVI, indicated by R-2 of 0.82 and 0.80 for VV and VH polarization, respectively; and (3) the overall root mean square error of normalized sigma(PQ) based on the newly-developed dynamic method is 0.51 dB, and this accuracy outperforms the original first-order cosine method (1.37 dB) and cosine square law method (1.08 dB) by about 63% and 53% on the whole. This study provides a dynamic framework for normalizing radar backscatter coefficient, improving the retrieval accuracy of land surface parameters from radar remote sensing.

AB A quantitative assessment of annual soil erosion by water in the northern part of Kirkuk Governorate, north of Iraq was investigated through integration of remote sensing, GIS and empirical RULSE soil erosion model. The five factors of RULSE model (rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length and steepness LS, crop management C, and practice factor P) were derived from different resources such as field survey, archival data, digital elevation model, and LANDSAT 8 multi-bands imagery. The annual soil erosion loss was estimated by multiplying the five factors in raster format using raster calculator of ArcGIS 10.2 software. The estimated annual soil losses rate for the study area ranges from 0 to 245 (t ha(-1) yr(-1)) with an average of 2 (t ha(-1) y(-1)). The value ranges were classified into four categories: minimal, low, moderate, high soil erosion hazard zones using four classification schema: quantile, natural breaks, geometric, and standard deviation. Due to the similarity of results, the comparison was carried out between two schemas: natural breaks and geometric. The area covered by minimal-low soil hazard zones extends over an area of about 88% and 99% based on geometric and natural breaks schema, respectively. In turn, the moderate-high soil hazard zones cover only very small area (0.3%) based on natural breaks and relatively small area (12%) depending on geometric scheme. In general, both method results indicate that hazard of soil erosion is low in the study area. The spatial pattern of classified soil erosion rate indicates that the areas at moderate to high risk is located in the northeast and very small area in the east, while the minimal to low zones cover the other parts. The obtained results of could be useful to implement soil conservation practices in the study area.

TI Vegetable mapping using fuzzy classification of Dynamic Time Warping

AB Vegetable production is important because of the food security, diet improvement and socio-economic value. Mapping the location and extent of vegetable fields is therefore important in agricultural policy, food security and farmer support. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a common way to map crops from time series of satellite images. However, as all hard classifications, it does not show the spatial distribution of uncertainty in the classification. In fuzzy classification, where memberships to multiple classes are assigned to each pixel, differ-ences in membership between the first and the runners-up class can be used to assess classification uncertainty at the pixel level. This research formulates a fuzzy classifier based upon Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) distances to map vegetable types from time series of Sentinel-1A SAR images. For each pixel, the TWDTW distances to the classes was normalised by dividing them by the sum of all TWDTW distances to all the classes for that pixel. The normalized distances were then used to compute fuzzy memberships for each pixel to each class, using the Gaussian membership function. Based on these memberships, fuzzy measures such as Confusion Index (CI), Ambiguity Index (AI), fuzziness and fuzzy membership were calculated and different thresholds applied on each of the measures during subsequent defuzzification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the defuzzified output results were 0.86 and 0.83, respectively, which was an improvement with regard to the crisp Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping with SPRING strategy for subsequence searching (TWDTWS) algorithm with 0.73 and 0.68 for overall accuracy and kappa, respectively. This study concludes that this new approach improves classification accuracy in image classification by excluding pixels with high un-certainty, which is especially relevant when only a limited number of classes are sampled and mapped.

DT Article
ID STRESS; WHEAT
AB The objective of this research was to develop a ground-based real-time remote sensing system for detecting diseases in arable crops under field conditions and in an early stage of disease development, before it can visibly be detected. This was achieved through sensor fusion of hyper-spectral reflection information between 450 and 900 nm and fluorescence imaging. The work reported here used yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) disease of winter wheat as a model system for testing the featured technologies. Hyper-spectral reflection images of healthy and infected plants were taken with an imaging spectrograph under field circumstances and ambient lighting conditions. Multi-spectral fluorescence images were taken simultaneously on the same plants using UV-blue excitation. Through comparison of the 550 and 690 nm fluorescence images, it was possible to detect disease presence. The fraction of pixels in one image, recognized as diseased, was set as the final fluorescence disease variable called the lesion index (LI). A spectral reflection method, based on only three wavebands, was developed that could discriminate disease from healthy with an overall error of about 11.3%. The method based on fluorescence was less accurate with an overall discrimination error of about 16.5%. However, fusing the measurements from the two approaches together allowed overall disease from healthy discrimination of 94.5% by using QDA. Data fusion was also performed using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network which decreased the overall classification error to 1%. The possible implementation of the SOM-based disease classifier for rapid retraining in the field is discussed. Further, the real-time aspects of the acquisition and processing of spectral and fluorescence images are discussed. With the proposed adaptations the multi-sensor fusion disease detection system can be applied in the real-time detection of plant disease in the field. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, methodologies for evaluating agricultural production do not allow precision tracking or monitoring of the production. The state Merida in Venezuela contributes to the country with more than 515,000 MT in agricultural goods. Lack of the above mentioned methodologies hinder the truthful capture of agricultural production data; alternative technologies are being used to overcome such deficiency. Panelera cane (Saccharum officinarum sp) has been monitored through Sentinel 2A satellite images captured from 27/03/2016 to 01/04/2017; and processed with QGIS-2.18 software. Agrarian records were used to establish training and verification areas of the supervised classification 379 hectares (ha) of crop were identified by 27/03/2016; and 361 ha by 01/04/2017. The present evaluation identified 51.6% (129 ha) of additional area as that reported by the official institutions of Merida for the year 2016; production is estimated to exceed by more than 50% in 2017 because institutions has not consolidated the information.

AB This research study aims to classify crop diversity in agricultural land with a segment-based approach using multi-temporal Kompsat-2 and Environmental Satellite (Envisat) advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) data acquired in June, July and August on Karacabey Plain, Turkey. Analyses start with the image segmentation process applied to the fused optical images to search homogenous objects. The segmentation outputs are evaluated using multiple goodness measures, which take into consideration area and location similarities. Image classifications are performed on each multispectral (MS) single date image. In order to combine the most probable classes of the thematic maps, distance maps are generated. Evaluations of the thematic maps are performed through confusion matrices based on pixel-based and segment-based approaches. The results indicate that the highest overall accuracy of 88.71% and a kappa result of 0.86 are provided for the segment-based approach of the combined thematic map along with the microwave data, which is around 10% higher than the related pixel-based results.

AB The area of production under greenhouses has been in rapid growth in recent years. and at present there are over 500,000ha scattered all over the World. Due to the vast amount of inputs (water, fertilizers, fuel, etc.) required, and Outputs of various agricultural residues (vegetable waste, plastic sheeting, phytosanitary product containers, etc.), the impact of this type of production system to the environment is considerable in particular if pursued without a sound and sustainable territorial planning. Thus, very high-resolution images provided by satellites such as QuickBird and Ikonos can be useful to plan the expansion of the greenhouse crop-production system in a sustainable way, as well as to reduce the environmental impact of the actual greenhouses improving the inputs use efficiency (water, fertilizers, phytosanitary products, etc.).
   This work is focused on automated detection of the boundaries of greenhouses using for this purpose the classification results from very high-resolution multi-spectral images of Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared (RGBNIR) from QuickBird and Ikonos satellites. First, a supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and an Extraction and Classification of Homogeneous Objects (ECHO) both using all the four bands were carried Out with focus on plastic greenhouses detection. In the second step, the detected greenhouses according to the classification results were vectorized automatically to generate polygons with irregular borders. In the third step, the irregular contours of polygons were converted into straight lines using an algorithm based on the Hough transformation. The input parameters of this algorithm were obtained by two different procedures: calibration and pseudo-calibration. In the calibration process, the parameter set is obtained from a sample of greenhouses minimizing the area and perimeter errors. in the pseudo-calibration process, a parameter set is obtained for each greenhouse but it is a high time-consumer task. The calibration yielded 66.7% for QuickBird and 49% for Ikonos image of correct delineation of greenhouses. Pseudo-calibration improved success rate and reduced performance difference between the two types of images. The proposed algorithm is able to delineate any greenhouse contour if the proper parameters set is correctly derived. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given the frequent cloud cover, regular updating of land cover maps of tropical areas via optical satellite data is problematic. As weather independent ERS images are available on a regular basis, the question is raised whether they can be used to produce a land cover map.
   From visual interpretation of the radar images several land cover types can be discerned, provided that the area is sufficiently flat. A suite of tools has been designed for computer-aided processing of the radar images. It consists of calibration, resampling, filtering, segmentation, principal component transformation and supervised classification of multitemporal radar images. The procedure has been applied to a series of 4 SAR.PRI images, taken over north-east Costa Rica, which yielded a land cover map with an overall accuracy of 78 %. The mapping accuracy for banana proved to be very high (95 %) for multi- as well as monotemporal data. This high precision is most Interesting, because of the economic importance of this crop and its environmental impact.

AB Estimation of vegetation water content (VWC) by optical remote sensing improves soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave radiometry. For a variety of vegetation types, the largest unknown for predicting VWC is stem water content, which is assumed to be allometrically related to the water content of the plant canopy. For maize and soybean, measured stem water contents were highly correlated to canopy water contents, so VWC was calculated directly from the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), which contrasts scattering at near-infrared wavelengths with absorption of shortwave infrared wavelengths by liquid water. Woodland tree height is linearly related to woody stem volume, and hence to stem water content. We hypothesized that tree height is positively correlated with canopy water content, and thus with NDII. Airborne color-infrared imagery was acquired at two study areas in a mixed agricultural and woodland landscape, and photogrammetric structure-from-motion point clouds were derived to estimate tree heights. However, estimated tree heights were only weakly correlated with measured data acquired for validation. NDII was calculated from Landsat 8 Operational Line Imager (30-m pixel) and WorldView-3 (7.5 m pixel); but contrary to the hypothesis, NDII was not correlated with woodland tree height. Lastly, the interaction of woodland and crops stem water contents on total VWC in a mixed landscape were simulated for 2 days, one in the early summer and one in the late summer. VWC for the region varied from 2.5 to 3.0 kg m(-2), which was just under a threshold for accuracy for soil moisture retrievals using Coriolis WindSat. Woodland tree height should be included as an ancillary data set along with land cover classification for soil moisture retrieval algorithms.

AB In recent decades, plastic-mulched farmland has expanded rapidly in China as well as in the rest of the world because it results in marked increases of crop production. However, plastic-mulched farmland significantly influences the environment and has so far been inadequately investigated. Accurately monitoring and mapping plastic-mulched farmland is crucial for agricultural production, environmental protection, resource management, and so on. Monitoring plastic-mulched farmland using moderate-resolution remote sensing data is technically challenging because of spatial mixing and spectral confusion with other ground objects. This paper proposed a new scheme that combines spectral and textural features for monitoring the plastic-mulched farmland and evaluates the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with different kernel functions using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. The textural features were extracted from multi-bands OLI data using a Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithm. Then, six combined feature sets were developed for classification. The results indicated that Landsat-8 OLI data are well suitable for monitoring plastic-mulched farmland; the SVM classifier with a linear kernel function is superior both to other kernel functions and to two other widely used supervised classifiers: Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC). For the SVM classifier with a linear kernel function, the highest overall accuracy was derived from combined spectral and textural features in the 90 degrees direction (94.14%, kappa 0.92), followed by the combined spectral and textural features in the 45 degrees (93.84%, kappa 0.92), 135 degrees (93.73%, kappa 0.92), 0 degrees (93.71%, kappa 0.92) directions, and the spectral features alone (93.57%, kappa 0.91). Spectral features make a more significant contribution to monitoring the plastic-mulched farmland; adding textural features from medium resolution imagery provide only limited improvement in accuracy.

AB Soybean is regarded as one of the most produced crops in the world, presenting a source of high-quality protein for human and animal diets. The general objective of the study was to determine the optimal soybean land suitability and conduct its mapping based on the multicriteria analysis. The multicriteria analysis was based on Geographic Information System (GIS) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) integration, using Sentinel-2 multitemporal images for suitability validation. The study area covered Osijek-Baranja County, a 4155 km(2) area located in eastern Croatia. Three criteria standardization methods (fuzzy, stepwise and linear) were evaluated for soybean land suitability calculation. The delineation of soybean land suitability classes was performed by k-means unsupervised classification. An independent accuracy assessment of calculated suitability values was performed by a novel approach with peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, derived from four Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images. Fuzzy standardization with the combination of soil and climate criteria produced the most accurate suitability values, having the top coefficient of determination of 0.8438. A total of 14.5% of the study area (602 km(2)) was determined as the most suitable class for soybean cultivation based on k-means classification results, while 64.3% resulted in some degree of suitability.

AB The knowledge of the distribution, area, and current conservation status of relict natural grasslands dominated by the tall-tussock grass Paspalum quadrifarium Lam. ("pajonal") in the Flooding Pampa (Argentina) is relevant for the identification of conservation sites and sustainable management and land-use planning. Since European settlement, vast areas of pajonal were converted to croplands and short-grass prairies. The only available vegetation map of these grasslands was made in the mid-20th century. We evaluated 2 methods of land-cover classification (supervised and unsupervised) using a Landsat TM satellite image over an area of 2 258.21 km(2) in Ayacucho county, where pajonal still persists as an important ecosystem. At the paddock scale, this grassland community presents a complex structure in which the pajonal is not a pure category but a mosaic of tall and short grasses. Six categories of land cover were adopted (crops, sown pastures, short grasses, pajonal, wetlands, and urban areas). A very good overall accuracy was obtained for both classifications (86.9% and 87.9% for supervised and unsupervised classifications, respectively). However, both producer's and user's accuracies for the pajonal and short grasses were better for the unsupervised classification than for the supervised classification. The pajonal class occupied only 20% of the study area with patch size ranging between 0.09 and 1 653 ha. This work suggests an important replacement of tall-tussock grass by short-grass matrix, which represents noticeable structural and functional changes. The unsupervised classification of Landsat image seems a particularly suitable method for mapping complex vegetation units like the highly fragmented pajonal of the Flooding Pampa and should be an important tool for management and tracking future changes.

AB The monitoring techniques and methods of Verticillium wilt were benefit for increasing yield and efficiency of cotton, and could provide theoretical basis for distribution of crops and disease resistant variety. The study make use of TM satellite multispectral image in the study area as data sources, combining with the ground survey data, find the optimal band combination to monitor cotton fields infected Verticillium wilt. Then four supervised classification methods, included minimum distance method, the parallelepiped method, spectral angle mapping classification and support vector machine algorithm, were applied to recognize cotton fields of Verticillium wilt. Results showed that false color band combination which from the blue band (band1), near infrared wave band (band4) and the short infrared wavelengths (band5) of the multispectral image, can be used as optimal combination of TM image to monitoring cotton fields of disease. Cotton fields of diseases could all been recognized and classified into different types by four supervisedclassification methods during blooming period; and the results of the parallelepiped method was most closest to reality, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 90% and 85%, respectively, were highest in the four algorithms. The results could satisfy the production requirements, and be carried out in fast diagnosis of cotton field infected Verticilliumwilt.

DE Cultivation of Eucalyptus; Remote Sensing; Use and Land Cover
AB The present research has as main objective, to analyze the expansion of the eucalyptus crop in the city of Brasilandia/MS between the years of 2000 and 2014. For that, the GISs of ArcGis 10 and Spring 5.2.6 were used, that helped in the organization of the bank of geographic data and, consequently, in the later mappings of land use and land cover. In Spring 5.2.6 the segmentation and classification of the satellite images was carried out and in ArcGis 10 the conference was realized with the reality shown in the images, as well as in field outputs. The results pointed to an increase in the areas cultivated by eucalyptus, especially in the vicinity of the highways, thus pointing to a trend that facilitates the cutting of the plots, pest control and, mainly, transporting the eucalyptus until reaching Fibria/MS Celulose Ltda.; located in the municipality to the north, Tres Lagoas. On the other hand, it was demonstrated the reduction of the forest areas, as well as the pastures, that have been modified, either by exposed soil or the own production of eucalyptus. Concluding that the form of realization of the classifications, they managed to reach the objective of this research, demonstrating the growing eucalyptus expansion.

AB During the last decade, the combination of digital images and machine learning techniques for tackling agricultural problems has been one of the most explored elements of digital farming. In the specific case of proximal images, most efforts have been directed to the detection and classification of plant diseases and crop-damaging pests. Important progress has also been made on the use of close-range images to determine vegetal nutrient status, but because such studies are fewer and more scattered, it is difficult to draw a complete picture on the state of art of this type of research. In this context, a thorough literature search was carried out in order to identify as many relevant investigations on the subject as possible. Every kind of imaging sensor was considered (visible range, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, etc.), provided that images were captured at close range, thus excluding research using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), airplanes and satellites. A careful analysis of the techniques for detection and classification was carried out and used as basis for an in-depth discussion on the main challenges yet to be overcome. Some directions for future research are also suggested, having as target to increase the practical adoption of this kind of technology.

DE DRON; NVDI; Termography; Reflectance; Precision agriculture
AB Precision agriculture is defined as the "management of spatial and temporal variability at the field subplot level, to improve economic returns and reduce environmental impact." To characterize this variability, tools such as Global Positioning Systems (GNSS), plant-climate-soil sensors and images obtained from satellites, airplanes or RPAS are used. The main goal of precision farming is to achieve higher economic, environmental and social returns as well as an increase in competitiveness through greater efficiency in agricultural practices.
   To this end, a DRON has been equipped with the necessary tools for the acquisition of remote images. In this way, maps of the area are obtained with the classification of the different states of vigor in which the crop is at a given time. At the same time, soil and leaf samples have been collected in these areas of different vigor to be compared later with the DRON images.
   Smart Rural and INEA collaborate in this project in which images and field samples are statistically correlated. The purpose is to develop a statistical model that establishes, just by looking at an image, the number of units of fertilizer that must be supplied to an area. It is difficult for a crop to develop homogeneously on a plot. Thus, it is intended that through rapid diagnosis of the plot, the farmer knows precisely in what areas must provide fertilizer and how much.

AB Empirical studies of the relative effects of landscape variables may compromise inferential strength with common approaches to landscape selection. We propose a methodology for landscape sample selection that is designed to overcome some common statistical pitfalls that may hamper estimates of relative effects of landscape variables on ecological responses. We illustrate our proposed methodology through an application aimed at quantifying the relationships between farmland heterogeneity and biodiversity. For this project, we required 100 study landscapes that represented the widest possible ranges of compositional and configurational farmland heterogeneity, where these two aspects of heterogeneity were quantified as crop cover diversity (Shannon diversity index) and mean crop field size, respectively. These were calculated at multiple spatial extents from a detailed map of the region derived through satellite image segmentation and classification. Potential study landscapes were then selected in a structured approach such that: (1) they represented the widest possible range of both heterogeneity variables, (2) they were not spatially autocorrelated, and (3) there was independence (no correlation) between the two heterogeneity variables, allowing for more precise estimates of the regression coefficients that reflect their independent effects. All selection criteria were satisfied at multiple extents surrounding the study landscapes, to allow for multi-scale analysis. Our approach to landscape selection should improve the inferential strength of studies estimating the relative effects of landscape variables, particularly those with a view to developing land management guidelines.

AB Rice is produced in more than 95 countries worldwide and is a staple food for over half of the world's population. Rice is also a major food crop of Taiwan. There are numerous rice crops planted on the western plains of Taiwan, and, after the harvest season, the left-over straw is often burned on-site. The air pollutants from the burning emissions include CO2, CO, CH4 and other suspended particles, most of these being the greenhouse gases which cause global climate change. In this study FORMOSAT-2 satellite images and ground-truth data from 2008 and 2009 are used to conduct supervised classification and calculate the extent of the straw burning areas. It was found that 10% of the paddies in the study area were burned after harvest during this 2-yr period. On this pro rata basis, we calculated the overall carbon emissions from the burning of the straw. The findings showed that these few farmers produced up to 34 000 tons of carbon emissions in 2008, and 40 000 tons in 2009. The study results indicate that remotely sensed images can be used to efficiently evaluate the important characteristics for carbon emission detection. It also provides quantitative results that are relevant to tracking sources of transport pollution, postharvest burning, and Asian dust in Taiwan.

AB Sixteen landcover classes in a representative Swedish environment were analyzed and classified using one Landsat TM scene and seven ERS-1 SARPRI images acquired during 1993. Spectral and backscattering signature separabilities are analyzed using the Jeffries-Matusita distance measure to determine which combinations of channels/images contained the most information. Maximum likelihood, sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP, a Bayesian image segmentation algorithm), and back propagation neural network classification algorithms were applied and their performances evaluated. Results of the separability analyses indicated that the multitemporal SAR data contained more separable landcover information than did the multispectral TM data; the highest separabilities were achieved when the TM and SAR data were combined. Classification accuracy evaluation results indicate that the SMAP algorithm out-performed the maximum likelihood algorithm which, in turn, outperformed the neural network algorithm. The best KAPPA values, using combined data, were 0.495 for SMAP, 0.0445 for maximum likelihood, and 0.432 for neural network. Corresponding overall accuracy values were 57.1%, 52.4%, and 51.2%, respectively. A comparison between lumped crop area statistics with areal sums calculated from the classified satellite data gave the highest correspondence where the SMAP algorithm was used, followed by the maximum likelihood and neural network algorithms. Based on our application, we can therefore confirm the value of a multisource optical/SAR approach for analyzing landcover and the improvements to classification achieved using the SMAP algorithm.

AB Introduction: The characterization of land uses represents one of the essential inputs for the management of natural resources at different scales.
   Objective: To develop a methodology to characterize land use in the upper creek basin from the Azul stream (Buenos Aires, Argentina), through the fusion of satellite images with a medium spatial resolution.
   Materials and methods: A time-series of 23 images was used from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the MODIS-Terra satellite (product MOD13Q1) for the period May 2015 - May 2016. Landsat 8 images were used to discriminate some categories difficult to classify with NDVI-MODIS. The final cover map was validated regarding verification points independent to the classification process; its accuracy was evaluated by means of the Kappa statistic.
   Results and discussion: The NDVI time series allowed to recognize the phenological patterns of the covers and land use of greater representativeness in the region. Seven land cover were discriminated; the agricultural uses represented 81.5 % of the surface, double-crop wheat-soya (soybean in Argentina) system predominated (39.4 %). The overall accuracy of the final map was high (88.9 %, Kappa coefficient = 0.86).
   Conclusion: The methodology used has the advantage of being quick and replicable, to characterize the land uses of a given region and to evaluate its potential changes over time.

AB A 16-year time-series (1982-1997) of monthly maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from coarse-scale Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images was investigated for its application in identifying agricultural regions sensitive to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts. Cumulative NDVI values over the growing season were used to test the temporal and spatial sensitivity of rainfed agricultural regions in the US cornbelt to ENSO climate teleconnections. The correlation (R) between NDVI anomalies and yield anomalies aggregated to the Agricultural Statistics Division (ASD) level was 0.59 (significant at the 99% level). Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the NINO3 region (between +5.0degrees and -5.0degrees latitude and 90.0degrees and 180.0degrees west longitude in the Pacific Ocean), an indicator of the ENSO phenomenon, were significantly but weakly correlated with growing season NDVI anomalies, precipitation anomalies, and yield anomalies. Two classification schemes for El Nino, La Nina and Neutral years related to the crop growing season were applied-one based on simultaneous Pacific NINO3 SSTs (spring-summer), and one based on following winter Pacific NINO3 SSTs. The strongest differences in Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) spatial patterns among the three ENSO categories were found using the following winter SST classification. Classification of ENSO years is a key issue in analysing ENSO impacts on agriculture as represented by the NDVI, because the regularity of annual agricultural seasons is not synchronous with the quasi-regular Pacific SST cycles.

AB The monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in southern Port Said region area is very important for the planner of managements, governmental and non-governmental organizations, decision makers and the scientific community. This information is essential for planning and implementing policies to optimize the use of natural resources and accommodate development whilst minimizing the impact on the environment. To monitor these changes in the study area, two sets of satellite images (Landsat TM-5 and ETM+7) data were used with Path/Row (175/38) in date 1986 and 2006, respectively. The Landsat TM and ETM data are useful for this type of study due to its high spatial resolution, spectral resolution and low repetitive acquisition (16 days). A post-classification technique is used in this study based on hybrid classification (Unsupervised and Supervised). Each method used was assessed, and checked in field. Eight to Twelve LULC classes are recognized and mapping produced. The soils in southern Port Said area were classification in two orders for soil taxonomic units, which are Entisols and Aridisols and four sub-orders classes. The study land was evaluated into five classes from non suitable (N) to very highly suitable (S-1) for some crops in the southern region of Port Said studied soils, with assess the nature of future change following construction of the international coastal road which crosses near to the study area.

AB The aim's was to verify the influence of changes in land use and occupation in water availability in the river basin Urucui-Preto, Brazil, in the period 1984 to 2007. For the assessment of land use were used images from satellite Landsat 5 TM sensor (Thematic Mapper) and the classification of imagens was made by automatic supervised classification with the maximum likelihood algorithm. For the analysis of the hydrological behavior were used average flow data, maximum and minimum annual, minimum flow with seven days of annual duration (Q7) and flow rates associated with stays of 90% (Q90) and 95% (Q95) of the year. For the association between flow and land use was made the simple correlation between the variables, testing its 5% significance (p < 0.05). The results showed that when comparing the years 1984 and 2007, the Cerrado and Mata Riparian classes decreased 20.9% and 2.4% respectively, Solo Exposed / Crop Field class increased 13.48% and Burned Areas class increased by 9.83%. There were no significant correlations between changes of class variables in the use and occupation of land and the flows, due to the large area of the basin that has consequently reduced the hydrological effects.

AB Recently, availability of valuable high spatial and temporal resolution optical satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2 has provided a great opportunity for a wide variety of crop-related studies including crop phenology detection, crop biophysical and biochemical parameter estimation, and crop-type mapping. Most current crop mapping methods focus on supervised classification, demanding a large number of field sampling points to feed the classifier. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for silage maize mapping based on Sentinel-2 time-series data in three agricultural areas in Iran (namely Marvdasht, Abyek, and Mashhad) and an individual area in USA (Tulare County, California). We considered Marvdasht as the training site and other three sites as the test sites. After the preprocessing step, temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were computed from Sentinel-2 time-series images in 2017 and 2018. Then, the Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to the NDVI profile for noise reduction. Linear interpolation was also used for the construction of continuous NDVI time-series during the maize growing season. Then, phenological parameters were extracted in Marvdasht, for maize and other crops. After comprehensive analyses, the ratio of the slope from the peak of the greenness to the harvest (SPGH) to the length of the growing season (LOS) was suggested as an appropriate variable for automatic maize detection. Evaluation of this variable in the study sites confirmed its feasibility for automatic maize mapping, with the kappa coefficient values of 0.89, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.8 in Abyek, Marvdasht, Mashhad, and Tulare in 2017, respectively. The performance of the suggested method for the second year (2018) is close to those of 2017 which means that maize detection algorithm results are consistent and robust across years. Moreover, to ascertain high potential of the proposed variable, the results were compared with those of the maximum likelihood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in the test sites. The performance of SVM (with a large number of training samples) was analogous to that of the suggested automatic method in terms of accuracy; however, inferior performance of ML was evident. The results of this research demonstrated the great potential of our proposed phenological method in automatic silage maize mapping.

The present study focuses on evaluating the capability and contribution of hybrid decomposition techniques from Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) data to improve the optical image classification accuracy. Hybrid decomposition techniques such asm-delta (m-delta), m-chi (m-chi) andm-alpha (m-alpha) were extracted using Stokes parameters from circular fine resolution stripmap-1 (cFRS-1) mode of RISAT-1 data. Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural bands were extracted from backscattering images of RISAT-1 and spectral bands of linear imaging self scanning sensor - IV (LISS-IV) image. The hybrid decomposition parameters were used to improve the classification accuracies of SAR and optical images and compared with GLCM textural bands. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier was performed for different scenarios and accuracy assessment was evaluated for all the classified images using confusion matrix with help of reference data. The study observed that the RISAT-1 derived products provided reasonable classification accuracy (54%) and also provided better results when added to spectral bands of LISS-IV (74%). The mean and dissimilarity of GLCM textural bands provided best classification, when added individually with RISAT-1 (66%) and LISS-IV (82%), and combined with RISAT-1 and LISS-IV (80%). The results indicate that the optical sensor performs better for the classification of water bodies, fallow land and settlement, however, plantation and rice crops are better classified when combined with SAR hybrid decomposition parameters. The study also observed that GLCM textural bands may change the pixel values based on the window size. The changed pixel values contributed to improving the classification accuracy by 15%. The selected classification and processing methods resulted in reasonable accuracy in land cover mapping in a hilly area with intermittent plains.

AB Mapping high resolution (30-m or better) cropland extent over very large areas such as continents or large countries or regions accurately, precisely, repeatedly, and rapidly is of great importance for addressing the global food and water security challenges. Such cropland extent products capture individual farm fields, small or large, and are crucial for developing accurate higher-level cropland products such as cropping intensities, crop types, crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), crop productivity, and crop water productivity. It also brings many challenges that include handling massively large data volumes, computing power, and collecting resource intensive reference training and validation data over complex geographic and political boundaries. Thereby, this study developed a precise and accurate Landsat 30-m derived cropland extent product for two very important, distinct, diverse, and large countries: Australia and China. The study used of eight bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR1, and NDVI) of Landsat-8 every 16-day Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for the years 2013-2015. The classification was performed by using a pixel-based supervised random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm (MLA) executed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Each band was time-composited over 4-6 time-periods over a year using median value for various agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Australia and China. This resulted in a 32-48-layer mega-file data-cube (MFDC) for each of the AEZs. Reference training and validation data were gathered from: (a) field visits, (b) sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) data, and (c) ancillary sources such as from the National agriculture bureaus. Croplands versus non-croplands knowledge base for training the RF algorithm were derived from MFDC using 958 reference-training samples for Australia and 2130 reference-training samples for China. The resulting 30-m cropland extent product was assessed for accuracies using independent validation samples: 900 for Australia and 1972 for China. The 30-m cropland extent product of Australia showed an overall accuracy of 97.6% with a producer's accuracy of 98.8% (errors of omissions = 1.2%), and user's accuracy of 79% (errors of commissions = 21%) for the cropland class. For China, overall accuracies were 94% with a producer's accuracy of 80% (errors of omissions = 20%), and user's accuracy of 84.2% (errors of commissions = 15.8%) for cropland class. Total cropland areas of Australia were estimated as 35.1 million hectares and 165.2 million hectares for China. These estimates were higher by 8.6% for Australia and 3.9% for China when compared with the traditionally derived national statistics. The cropland extent product further demonstrated the ability to estimate sub-national cropland areas accurately by providing an R-2 value of 0.85 when compared with province-wise cropland areas of China. The study provides a paradigm-shift on how cropland maps are produced using multi-date remote sensing.

AB Ocean surveillance via high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries has been a hot issue because SAR is able to work in all-day and all-weather conditions. The launch of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite has provided a large number of SAR imageries, making it possible to marine targets monitoring. However, it is difficult for traditional methods to extract effective features to classify and detect different types of marine targets in SAR images. This paper proposes a convolutional neutral network (CNN) model for marine target classification at patch level and an overall scheme for marine target detection in large-scale SAR images. First, eight types of marine targets in GF-3 SAR images are labelled based on feature analysis, building the datasets for further experiments. As for the classification task at patch level, a novel CNN model with six convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers has been designed. With respect to the detection part, a Single Shot Multi-box Detector with a multi-resolution input (MR-SSD) is developed, which can extract more features at different resolution versions. In order to detect different targets in large-scale SAR images, a whole workflow including sea-land segmentation, cropping with overlapping, detection with MR-SSD model, coordinates mapping, and predicted boxes consolidation is developed. Experiments based on the GF-3 dataset demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods for marine target classification and detection.

AB Mangroves are one of the most valuable and productive coastal ecosystems. Previous studies show a severe loss of mangroves around the world over the last several decades due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Mangroves located in the southeastern part of the Mekong River Delta (MRD) are also affected by these activities. Shrimp farming is considered as one of the main drivers causing the rapid loss and degradation of mangroves. The goal of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal changes in land use and distribution of mangroves in the Soc Trang and Bac Lieu provinces of the southeastern part of the MRD. Multi-temporal Landsat data were used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using the maximum-likelihood classification algorithm. The changes in mangrove forest areas were monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager) satellite imageries from 1988 to 2018. In the study area, there were seven major LULC types namely, dense mangroves, sparse mangroves, aquaculture farms, arable land with crop cover, arable land without crop cover, settlements, and water bodies. The overall accuracies of the LULC maps in 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018 were 81.2%, 83.3%, 78.3%, and 81.9%, respectively. This study reveals that dense and sparse mangrove forests have decreased by 90% from 5495 hectares (ha) to 515 ha and by 55% from 14,105 to 6289 ha, respectively from 1988 to 2018. On the other hand, the aquaculture farm has increased at the rate of 5024 ha/year for a period of 30 years. This rapid growth of aquaculture farming activities caused the rapid loss and degradation of mangroves in the MRD. Quantitative information about mangrove change obtained by this study is considered to be useful for future coastal management and relevant policies in the MRD.

AB Large area tree maps, important for environmental monitoring and natural resource management, are often based on medium resolution satellite imagery. These data have difficulty in detecting trees in fragmented woodlands, and have significant omission errors in modified agricultural areas. High resolution imagery can better detect these trees, however, as most high resolution imagery is not normalised it is difficult to automate a tree classification method over large areas. The method developed here used an existing medium resolution map derived from either Landsat or SPOTS satellite imagery to guide the classification of the high resolution imagery. It selected a spatially-variable threshold on the green band, calculated based on the spatially-variable percentage of trees in the existing map of tree cover. The green band proved more consistent at classifying trees across different images than several common band combinations. The method was tested on 0.5 m resolution imagery from airborne digital sensor (ADS) imagery across New South Wales (NSW), Australia using both Landsat and SPOT5 derived tree maps to guide the threshold selection. Accuracy was assessed across 6 large image mosaics revealing a more accurate result when the more accurate tree map from SPOT5 imagery was used. The resulting maps achieved an overall accuracy with 95% confidence intervals of 93% (90-95%), while the overall accuracy of the previous SPOT5 tree map was 87% (86-89%). The method reduced omission errors by mapping more scattered trees, although it did increase commission errors caused by dark pixels from water, building shadows, topographic shadows, and some soils and crops. The method allows trees to be automatically mapped at 5 m resolution from high resolution imagery, provided a medium resolution tree map already exists. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite-based time-series crop monitoring at the subfield level is essential to the efficient implementation of precision crop management. Existing spatiotemporal image fusion techniques can be helpful, but they were often proposed to generate medium-resolution images. This study proposed a high-resolution spatiotemporal image fusion method (HISTIF) consisting of filtering for cross-scale spatial matching (FCSM) and multiplicative modulation of temporal change (MMTC). In FCSM, we considered both point spread function effect and geo-registration errors between fine and coarse resolution images. Subsequently, MMTC used pixel-based multiplicative factors to estimate the temporal change between reference and prediction dates without image classification. The performance of HISTIF was evaluated using both simulated and real datasets with one from real Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and simulated Landsat-like/Sentinel-like images, and the other from real GF-1 and real Landsat/Sentinel-2 data on two sites. HISTIF was compared with the existing methods spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), FSDAF, and Fit-FC. The results demonstrated that HISTIF produced substantial reduction in the fusion error from cross-scale spatial mismatch and accurate reconstruction in spatial details within fields, regardless of simulated or real data. The images predicted by STARFM exhibited pronounced blocky artifacts. While the images predicted by HISTIF and Fit-FC both showed clear within-field variability patterns, HISTIF was able to reduce the spectral distortion more significantly than Fit-FC. Furthermore, HISTIF exhibited the most stable performance across sensors. The findings suggest that HISTIF could be beneficial for the frequent and detailed monitoring of crop growth at the subfield level.

AB Remote sensing can quantify past and present fire activity at spatial scales useful for a range of fire and vegetation management applications. In this study, we present a new automated approach to classifying burnt areas across the state of Queensland, Australia. The method is applied to complete time series of Landsat TM/ETM + imagery rather than single images and considers spectral (band 4, B4, and bands 4 + 5, B45), thermal, temporal and contextual information within a hierarchical framework. To maximise the available observations and the burnt area detected, we used imagery containing up to 60% cloud that was screened during pre-processing. Median filters were applied to smooth the time series and multi-date change detection used to locate negative outliers (large declines in reflectance relative to the median-smoothed time series). Watershed region growing was used to segment and map a larger spatial extent of the change while minimising commission errors. These segmented change objects were attributed as either burnt or unburnt using their thermal, reflective and contextual characteristics in a classification tree. Thermal information was found to be more important than reflective indices in the change attribution. Algorithm calibration used training data from ten Path/Rows located strategically across Queensland with four images sampled per path row (n = 40). Thresholds were optimised to maximise the burnt area detected while limiting under/over-growing of burnt area. Validation data covered a range of burnt areas from ten independent Path/Rows with ten images sampled across a range of burnt area fractions per Path/Row (n = 100). The results for burnt area mapping demonstrated an average producer's accuracy of 85% (range of 28 to 100% for individual images) and average user's accuracy of 71% (range of 4 to 99% for individual images). A morphological dilation of one pixel restricted to locations exhibiting a decline in B45 over time, increased the producer's accuracy by 4% but reduced the user's accuracy by 8%. The total accuracy for the burnt area classification was greater than 99%, however this is more a reflection of the small fraction of landscape represented by burnt area rather than the ability to detect burnt area. Areas frequently misdassified were related to areas of high spectral/land use change which included areas of cropping, frequently inundated land, and moisture/ground cover variations over dark soils. In this study, we applied a crop and water mask to minimise commission errors. Significantly, the results of this study demonstrate that an automated time series method for mapping burnt areas can be successfully applied across a diversity of land cover types. The method may be applied in similar savanna dominated environments but is likely to require modification to be applicable in other landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Using SPOT-4 HRVIR and VEGETATION sensors to assess impact of tropical

ID BOREAL FORESTS; BIOMASS; AFRICA; AVHRR
AB Due to the El Nino phenomenon, the 1997-1998 dry season in Roraima (Brazil, Amazonia) was particularly pronounced. Consequently, vegetation fires spread widely and were monitored by many satellites in real time. Satellite images are currently being used to monitor vegetation fires either globally for climate studies or more regionally for impact assessment. After reviewing different satellite data used for impact assessment, this paper focuses on the contribution of SPOT-4's imagery provided by high resolution HRVIR and coarse resolution VEGETATION sensors. These sensors are described with emphasis on those characteristics of potential benefit for forest mapping and fire detection.
   Early images of Roraima from SPOT-4 are analysed and interpreted to delineate the areas already damaged by fire. VEGETATION images provide a first estimate of damaged areas on a regional scale and an indication of the main ecosystems affected. SPOT HRVIR is used to establish a much more precise classification of various ecosystems. Each vegetation class is associated with a biomass density. From the known burned areas, an estimate of burned biomass during the 1998 dry season is computed, as well as total carbon release. On an intensive study site of 20 400 km(2), 3060 km(2) of savannahs and crops and 6980 km 2 of forest have been burned; the corresponding carbon release is estimated as 210 000 t for croplands and savannahs and 23 Mt for the evergreen seasonal forest. The estimated burnt surface areas derived from VEGETATION are then cross-validated with HRVIR and thus an attempt is made to extrapolate the burned biomass with the help of VEGETATION on a regional scale.

AB To ensure orderly, planned rice production, and to meet environmental constraints on the location of rice in the landscape, there is a need to locate and measure the area of rice plantings by paddock and by farm.  Traditionally, rice areas have been estimated from manual measurements taken from aerial photography:  overall, an expensive and time-consuming approach.  In a pilot study covering 5 seasons on an area of 6 by 6.25 km containing 160 paddocks in 22 farms, we have found that it is possible to locate rice areas accurately, to determine their size, and to classify the vigour of the crop.  Information is transferred into a geographic information system from classified satellite imagery using Landsat Thematic Mapper bands 3, 4, and 5 and then processed with a simple rule to distinguish rice rapidly from other crops.  Furthermore, the classification categories rice within each paddock into 3 statistically distinct groups of poor, medium, or good crop vigour.  Total rice area and area of each rice class are computed for each rice paddock.  Paddock data are combined to give corresponding values for each farm and for the entire study area.  This information could be useful for forecasting rice yields in the current season and for the management of paddocks for more uniform and higher yields in subsequent seasons.  The procedures used require inexpensive software and are largely automated since they include unsupervised clustering.  The need for special skills is thereby minimised, making the transfer of the technology to interested parties quite straightforward.  Over the 5 seasons, all paddocks growing rice were correctly identified and only 2 non-rice paddocks wrongly identified as growing rice.

AB Four timely and broadly available remotely sensed datasets were assessed for inclusion into county-level corn and soybean yield forecasting efforts focused on the Corn Belt region of the central United States (US). Those datasets were the (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as derived from the Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), (2) daytime and (3) nighttime land surface temperature (LST) as derived from Aqua satellite's MODIS, and (4) precipitation from the National Weather Service (NWS) Nexrad-based gridded data product. The originating MODIS data utilized were the globally produced 8-day, clear sky composited science products (MOD09Q1 and MYD11A2), while the US-wide NWS data were manipulated to mesh with the MODIS imagery both spatially and temporally by regridding and summing the otherwise daily measurements. The crop growing seasons of 2006-2011 were analyzed with each year bounded by 32 8-day periods from mid-February through late October. Land cover classifications known as the Cropland Data Layer as produced annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were used to isolate the input dataset pixels as to corn and soybeans for each of the corresponding years. The relevant pixels were then averaged by crop and time period to produce a county-level estimate of NDVI, the LSTs, and precipitation. They in turn were related to official annual NASS county level yield statistics. For the Corn Belt region as a whole, both corn and soybean yields were found to be positively correlated with NDVI in the middle of the summer and negatively correlated to daytime LST at that same time. Nighttime LST and precipitation showed no correlations to yield, regardless of the time prior or during the growing season. There was also slight suggestion of low NDVI and high daytime LST in the spring being positively related to final yields, again for both crops. Taking only NDVI and daytime LST as inputs from the 2006-2011 dataset, regression tree-based models were built and county-level, within-sample coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.93 were found for both crops. Limiting the models by systematically removing late season data showed the model performance to remain strong even at mid-season and still viable even earlier. Finally, the derived models were used to predict out-of-sample for the 2012 season, which ended up having an anomalous drought Yet, the county-level results compared reasonably well against official statistics with R-2 = 0.77 for corn and 0.71 for soybeans. The root-mean-square errors were 1.26 and 0.42 metric tons per hectare, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB When using microwave remote sensing for land use/land cover (LULC) classifications, there are a wide variety of imaging parameters to choose from, such as wavelength, imaging mode, incidence angle, spatial resolution, and coverage. There is still a need for further study of the combination, comparison, and quantification of the potential of multiple diverse radar images for LULC classifications. Our study site, the Qixing farm in Heilongjiang province, China, is especially suitable to demonstrate this. As in most rice growing regions, there is a high cloud cover during the growing season, making LULC from optical images unreliable. From the study year 2009, we obtained nine TerraSAR-X, two Radarsat-2, one Envisat-ASAR, and an optical FORMOSAT-2 image, which is mainly used for comparison, but also for a combination. To evaluate the potential of the input images and derive LULC with the highest possible precision, two classifiers were used: the well-established Maximum Likelihood classifier, which was optimized to find those input bands, yielding the highest precision, and the random forest classifier. The resulting highly accurate LULC-maps for the whole farm with a spatial resolution as high as 8m demonstrate the beneficial use of a combination of x-and c-band microwave data, the potential of multitemporal very high resolution multi-polarization TerraSAR-X data, and the profitable integration and comparison of microwave and optical remote sensing images for LULC classifications.

AB The traditional method of identifying wildlife habitat distribution over large regions consists of pixel-based classification of satellite images into a suite of habitat classes used to select suitable habitat patches. Object-based classification is a new method that can achieve the same objective based on the segmentation of spectral bands of the image creating homogeneous polygons with regard to spatial or spectral characteristics. The segmentation algorithm does not solely rely on the single pixel value, but also on shape, texture, and pixel spatial continuity. The object-based classification is a knowledge base process where an interpretation key is developed using ground control points and objects are assigned to specific classes according to threshold values of determined spectral and/or spatial attributes. We developed a model using the eCognition software to identify suitable habitats for the Grasshopper Sparrow, a rare and declining species found in southwestern Quebec. The model was developed in a region with known breeding sites and applied on other images covering adjacent regions where potential breeding habitats may be present. We were successful in locating potential habitats in areas where dairy farming prevailed but failed in an adjacent region covered by a distinct Landsat scene and dominated by annual crops. We discuss the added value of this method, such as the possibility to use the contextual information associated to objects and the ability to eliminate unsuitable areas in the segmentation and land cover classification processes, as well as technical and logistical constraints. A series of recommendations on the use of this method and on conservation issues of Grasshopper Sparrow habitat is also provided.

AB Imagery from recently launched high spatial resolution WorldView-3 offers new opportunities for crop identification and landcover assessment. Multispectral WorldView-3 at 1.6m spatial resolution and LANDSAT8 images covering an extent of 100Km(2) in humid ecology of Nigeria were used for crop and landcover identification. Three supervised classification techniques (maximum likelihood(MLC), Neural Net clasifier(NNC) and support vector machine(SVM)) were used to classify WorldView-3 and LANDSAT8 into four crop classes and seven non-crop classes. For accuracy assessment, kappa coefficient, producer and user accuracies were used to evaluate the performance of all three supervised classifiers. NNC performed best with an overall accuracy(OA) of 92.20, kappa coefficient(KC) of 0.83 in landcover identification using WorldView-3. This was closely followed by SVM with an OA of 91.77%, KC of 0.83. MLC performed slightly lower at an OA of 91.25% and KC of 0.82. Classification of crops and landcover with LANDSAT8 was best with MLC classifier with an OA of 92.12%, KC of 0.89. Cassava at younger than 3 months old could not be identified correctly by all classifiers using WorldView-3 and LANDSAT8 products. In summary WorldView-3 and LANDSAT8 data had satisfactory performance in identifying different crop and landcover types though at varying degrees of accuracies.

AB Mapping croplands, including fallow areas, are an important measure to determine the quantity of food that is produced, where they are produced, and when they are produced (e.g. seasonality). Furthermore, croplands are known as water guzzlers by consuming anywhere between 70% and 90% of all human water use globally. Given these facts and the increase in global population to nearly 10 billion by the year 2050, the need for routine, rapid, and automated cropland mapping year-after-year and/or season-after-season is of great importance. The overarching goal of this study was to generate standard and routine cropland products, year-after-year, over very large areas through the use of two novel methods: (a) quantitative spectral matching techniques (QSMTs) applied at continental level and (b) rule-based Automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) with the ability to hind-cast, now-cast, and future-cast. Australia was chosen for the study given its extensive croplands, rich history of agriculture, and yet nonexistent routine yearly generated cropland products using multi-temporal remote sensing. This research produced three distinct cropland products using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m normalized difference vegetation index 16-day composite time-series data for 16 years: 2000 through 2015. The products consisted of: (1) cropland extent/areas versus cropland fallow areas, (2) irrigated versus rainfed croplands, and (3) cropping intensities: single, double, and continuous cropping. An accurate reference cropland product (RCP) for the year 2014 (RCP2014) produced using QSMT was used as a knowledge base to train and develop the ACCA algorithm that was then applied to the MODIS time-series data for the years 2000-2015. A comparison between the ACCA-derived cropland products (ACPs) for the year 2014 (ACP2014) versus RCP2014 provided an overall agreement of 89.4% (kappa=0.814) with six classes: (a) producer's accuracies varying between 72% and 90% and (b) user's accuracies varying between 79% and 90%. ACPs for the individual years 2000-2013 and 2015 (ACP2000-ACP2013, ACP2015) showed very strong similarities with several other studies. The extent and vigor of the Australian croplands versus cropland fallows were accurately captured by the ACCA algorithm for the years 2000-2015, thus highlighting the value of the study in food security analysis. The ACCA algorithm and the cropland products are released through http://croplands.org/app/map and http://geography.wr.usgs.gov/science/croplands/algorithms/australia_250m.html

AB Remote sensing techniques gain increasing importance in landscape archaeological research. Traditional archaeological excavation techniques are slow and time in the Nile Delta is running out. The Nile Delta has been settled and used for agricultural cultivation since the Neolithic period and is shaped by the interplay of urbanization and agriculture. In particular, the study of ancient settlement mounds (tells) and landscape archaeological features such as former river channels requires urgent action. This study seeks to develop supervised classification techniques on the basis of multitemporal Landsat 8 images to easily monitor existing high tells in the Delta that have not been destroyed yet. In the 19th and early 20th centuries many tells were destroyed, because tell sediments (sebakh) were harvested on an industrial scale in order to be used as fertilizer. These activities continued on a smaller scale into the mid to later 20th century. Geochemical analysis of ancient settlement material (sebakh) has confirmed the high content of nutrients. In a second step which is based on these geochemical findings, we seek to identify the category of lost tells which had been transformed into agricultural areas. We suggest that the presence of ancient settlement material enhances the overall vegetation performance and indirectly allows identification of lost tells via describing the vegetation performance. In general, the vegetation performance is a new measure and invented within this study. It is calculated as the product of different measures describing the plant growth, namely the mean NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), growth statistics and crop rotations derived from a large set of multitemporal NDVI images. Our results show that there exists a relationship between vegetation performance and the appearance of archaeological material in the topsoil and such information can be useful for planning of non-invasive archaeological surveys. Remarkably the vegetation performance corresponds with the location of former Nile branches that are currently investigated by the authors on the basis of TandemX elevation data and sedimentological investigations of the area. Several factors such as water availability and salinity also affect plant growth and mask this relationship. Additionally, our methods to describe the number of crop rotations or growth statistics from NDVI time series help to analyse the agricultural areas in the Nile Delta. Therefore, the methods used in this study may offer important insights on aspects of urban sprawl and agricultural areas in the Nile Delta and beyond.

AB Detailed, accurate and frequent land cover mapping is a prerequisite for several important geospatial applications and the fulfilment of current sustainable development goals. This paper introduces a methodology for the classification of annual high-resolution satellite data into several detailed land cover classes. In particular, a nomenclature with 27 different classes was introduced based on CORINE Land Cover (CLC) Level-3 categories and further analysing various crop types. Without employing cloud masks and/or interpolation procedures, we formed experimental datasets of Landsat-8 (L8) images with gradually increased cloud cover in order to assess the influence of cloud presence on the reference data and the resulting classification accuracy. The performance of shallow kernel-based and deep patch-based machine learning classification frameworks was evaluated. Quantitatively, the resulting overall accuracy rates differed within a range of less than 3%; however, maps produced based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) were more accurate across class boundaries and the respective framework was less computationally expensive compared to the applied patch-based deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Further experimental results and analysis indicated that employing all multitemporal images with up to 30% cloud cover delivered relatively higher overall accuracy rates as well as the highest per-class accuracy rates. Moreover, by selecting 70% of the top-ranked features after applying a feature selection strategy, slightly higher accuracy rates were achieved. A detailed discussion of the quantitative and qualitative evaluation outcomes further elaborates on the performance of all considered classes and highlights different aspects of their spectral behaviour and separability.

AB In May 2019, Collection 2 of the Copernicus Global Land Cover layers was released. Next to a global discrete land cover map at 100 m resolution, a set of cover fraction layers is provided depicting the percentual cover of the main land cover types in a pixel. This additional continuous classification scheme represents areas of heterogeneous land cover better than the standard discrete classification scheme. Overall, 20 layers are provided which allow customization of land cover maps to specific user needs or applications (e.g., forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and conservation, climate modeling, etc.). However, Collection 2 was not just a global up-scaling, but also includes major improvements in the map quality, reaching around 80% or more overall accuracy. The processing system went into operational status allowing annual updates on a global scale with an additional implemented training and validation data collection system. In this paper, we provide an overview of the major changes in the production of the land cover maps, that have led to this increased accuracy, including aligning with the Sentinel 2 satellite system in the grid and coordinate system, improving the metric extraction, adding better auxiliary data, improving the biome delineations, as well as enhancing the expert rules. An independent validation exercise confirmed the improved classification results. In addition to the methodological improvements, this paper also provides an overview of where the different resources can be found, including access channels to the product layer as well as the detailed peer-review product documentation.

AB Water is a strategic resource for both socio-economic development and human life. The current study has been carried out for spatio-temporal change detection of surface water bodies during winter period using hybrid modelling approach. The study area has fallen in the northern part of Bangladesh and is locally called Chalan Beel with 5 million of in habitants, a prominent intensive crop production, surface and groundwater irrigation, high evapotranspiration, and water scarcity. For the detection of water body changes, satellite images of 1999 and 2011 were used, and the following image fusion techniques were applied: (a) Gram-Schmidt (GS), (b) modified intensity hue saturation (IHS), (c) high-pass filter (HPF), and (d) wavelet. Landsat 7/ETM+panchromatic (PAN) band of 15 mx15 m resolution in 1999 and Landsat 5/TM multispectral (MS) bands of 30 mx30 m resolution in 2011 were allied each other to generate high-resolution image that contains information of two different years. The fused images were classified to extract the water bodies using four classification methods: (a) artificial neural network (ANN), (b) support vector machine (SVM) and (c) maximum likelihood (ML). To analyze the quality of the fused images, statistical calculation (quantitatively) and Laplacian edge detection (qualitatively) were used. To validate the fused image classification results, the multispectral images from 1999 and 2011 were again individually classified using principal component analysis (PCA), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and image differencing (ID) processes and compared with the previous classification. Surprisingly, the results showed that two-third of the areas dried up in 10 years.

AB Increasing woody cover and overgrazing in semi-arid ecosystems are known to be the major factors driving land degradation. This study focuses on mapping the distribution of the slangbos shrub (Seriphium plumosum) in a test region in the Free State Province of South Africa. The goal of this study is to monitor the slangbos encroachment on cultivated land by synergistically combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) Earth observation information. Both optical and radar satellite data are sensitive to different vegetation properties and surface scattering or reflection mechanisms caused by the specific sensor characteristics. We used a supervised random forest classification to predict slangbos encroachment for each individual crop year between 2015 and 2020. Training data were derived based on expert knowledge and in situ information from the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD). We found that the Sentinel-1 VH (cross-polarization) and Sentinel-2 SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) time series information have the highest importance for the random forest classifier among all input parameters. The modelling results confirm the in situ observations that pastures are most affected by slangbos encroachment. The estimation of the model accuracy was accomplished via spatial cross-validation (SpCV) and resulted in a classification precision of around 80% for the slangbos class within each time step.

AB Land-use and land-cover change can pray a pivotal role in environmental changes. Using aerial photos and spot satellite image on two nearby but different agroecological zones of the Kenyan highlands, an extensive semi-arid area in the lower zone and a humid area in the upper zone, significant land-use changes were identified between 1958, 1985 and 1995. These land-use changes were observed through a photo-interpretation of photos and image with a common classification scheme. The pattern and the development of land-use change differed markedly over the 40-year period between the upper and the lower zone. The introduction of cash-crops had a significant impact on the land-use in the upper zone. Tree plantations whose Lines characterize the present landscape came with the switch to cash-crops. In contrast, although no significant land-use changes occurred between 1958 and 1985 in the lower zone, the changes over the last 10 years were significant, with a 75 % increase in cultivated land area. Part of these land-use changes can be explained by strong Links between the two zones, as the lower zone became an outlet for the very high population density of the upper zone. This study is a first step for an in-depth characterization of the various driving forces and for land-use planning in these Kenyan highlands. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lack of accurate and up-to-date data associated with irrigated areas and related irrigation amounts is hampering the full implementation and compliance of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In this paper, we describe the framework that we developed and implemented within the DIANA project to map the actual extent of irrigated areas in the Campania region (Southern Italy) during the 2018 irrigation season. For this purpose, we considered 202 images from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) products (57 images from Landsat 8 and 145 images from Sentinel-2). Such data were preprocessed in order to extract a multitemporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map, which was then smoothed through a gap-filling algorithm. We further integrated data coming from high-resolution (4 km) global satellite precipitation Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Cloud Classification System (CCS) products. We collected an extensive ground truth in the field represented by 2992 data points coming from three main thematic classes: bare soil and rainfed (class 0), herbaceous (class 1), and tree crop (class 2). This information was exploited to generate irrigated area maps by adopting a machine learning classification approach. We compared six different types of classifiers through a cross-validation approach and found that, in general, random forests, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees exhibited the best performances in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to different tested scenarios. We found an overall accuracy close to 90% in discriminating among the three thematic classes, which highlighted promising capabilities in the detection of irrigated areas from HLS products.

AB The characteristics of satellite-derived land-cover data for climate models vary depending on sensor properties and processing options. To better understand the first-order effects of differences in land-cover data on a land surface parameterization scheme (VBATS), stand-alone model runs were performed for two adjacent 2.8 degrees X 2.8 degrees GCM grid cells in Wyoming using land cover from two satellite-derived maps (AVHRR, TM) and a global land-cover dataset commonly used in GCM2.
   The dominant cover type by area differed among the datasets for both grid cells. In the western grid cell, these differences resulted in substantially different surface fluxes simulated by VBATS. At spatial resolutions of 0.2 degrees and 0.4 degrees, the two satellite-derived datasets agreed on only 54%-62% of the land-cover types in both grid cells. Despite this disagreement, the VBATS simulated surface fluxes averaged over the grid cell were similar in the eastern grid cell for the two satellite-derived datasets. In the western grid cell, the partitioning of net radiation into Sensible and latent heat fluxes was influenced by the dataset prescriptions of land-cover heterogeneity. In particular, the relative proportions of wet cover types (i.e., inland water and irrigated crop) had an effect on this partitioning, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the presence of wet cover types within a GCM grid cell in arid regions.
   Spatial aggregation of the satellite-derived datasets reduced the number of land-cover types prescribed for each GCM grid cell. In the western grid cell, the reduction in the number of cover types from 11 to 2 resulted in differences in annual averages of sensible and latent heat fluxes of about 10%. Other simulations involving these datasets suggest that these differences could be reduced if one accounted for the wet cover types. In this respect, fine spatial resolution is required for some cover types, whereas coarser resolution may be adequate for other types. Land-cover classifications for land surface modeling need to be based more on model sensitivities than on traditional vegetation-type schemes.

AB The agricultural system in south-eastern Spain is based on intensive horticulture in greenhouses. Public and private organizations have spent substantial resources on optimizing irrigation, due to the scant annual precipitation (close to 250 mm). In order to preserve natural water resources, avoiding overexploitation and salinization aquifers, the water loss has to be minimized. Farmers save water in irrigation reservoirs, which are open to the atmosphere most of the time. In this work, the loss to evaporation from open water reservoirs was estimated in a typical agricultural greenhouse area in Almeria province, south-eastern Spain. The data source was both a high-resolution satellite image, and a set of climatic data from the Agro-climatic Information Network of Andalusia (AINA) and from a Class-A pan evaporimeter. The image was used for detecting and delineating open water bodies applying a supervised classification algorithm based on an artificial neural network. The climatic data were used to estimate the distribution of monthly evaporation. It was concluded that irrigation water reservoirs can evaporate 3.76% of the input water used for crops. If all of the water bodies were covered with shade materials and if the precipitation intercepted by the roofs of greenhouses were saved in the irrigation water reservoirs, 49.87% of water annually consumed by greenhouse crops could be saved.

AB The objective of this study consisted on mapping the use and soil occupation and evaluation of the quality of irrigation water used in Salto do Lontra, in the state of Parana, Brazil. Images of the satellite SPOT-5 were used to perform the supervised classification of the Maximum Likelihood algorithm - MAXVER, and the water quality parameters analyzed were pH, EC, HCO3-, Cl-, PO43-, NO3-, turbidity, temperature and thermotolerant coliforms in two distinct rainfall periods. The water quality data were subjected to statistical analysis by the techniques of PCA and FA, to identify the most relevant variables in assessing the quality of irrigation water. The characterization of soil use and occupation by the classifier MAXVER allowed the identification of the following classes: crops, bare soil/stubble, forests and urban area. The PCA technique applied to irrigation water quality data explained 53.27% of the variation in water quality among the sampled points. Nitrate, thermotolerant coliforms, temperature, electrical conductivity and bicarbonate were the parameters that best explained the spatial variation of water quality.

AB The EO-1 satellite is part of NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). It consists of three imaging sensors: the multispectral Advanced Land Imager (ALI), Hyperion and Atmospheric Corrector. Hyperion provides a high-resolution hyperspectral imager capable of resolving 220 spectral bands (from 0.4 to 2.5 micron) with a 30 m resolution. Three examples of EO-1 Hyperion data analysis efforts are illustrated.
   The discussion begins with a cloud cover algorithm that utilizes only solar reflective channels to discriminate cloud types and cloud/surface features. The algorithm is applied to a variety of Hyperion scenes that depict various cloud types, surface features and seasonal conditions.
   The second example illustrates hyperspectral application to coastal characterization. Hyperion data from Chesapeake Bay from 19 February 2002 are analyzed. Chlorophyll retrieval results are shown. The results compare favorably with data from other sources.
   The third example deals with terrain analysis for background classification applications. Abundance levels of lush vegetation and bare soil are estimated for image pixels located between different fields of crops over Coleambally Irrigation Area, Australia on 7 March 2000.

AB Soil salinity is the dominant process in the degradation of arid and semi-arid soils, which in turn reduces crop yields, increases erosion, and exacerbates desertification. In recent years, soil salinity has affected much of the land in the Atabieh area located in the west of Khuzestan province in Iran. The purpose of this study was thus to evaluate and map soil salinity changes in the region over 15 years using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images. To that end, the spectra of saline soils in the study area were extracted from the satellite data, and after the initial pre-processing in EVNI software version 5.3, the SI1, SI2, SI3, BI, NDVI, and NDSI indices were prepared. Using the supervised classification method, the salinity map with four different classes was then plotted in Arc GIS version 10.2, and the changes in saline soil area were investigated. Moreover, field surveys, surface soil sampling, soil EC measurement and identification of available minerals were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and satellite images. Among the studied indices, the BI index with the highest correlation (0.71) was considered as the best index, and NDVI with the correlation coefficient of 0.35 at the 95% confidence level, was the best index for vegetation cover. Examination of changes in BI index by Landsat 7 images showed that the non-saline land area decreased from 1023.54 ha in 2000 to 143.43 ha in 2010, while the area with medium salinity increased by 14.57%. Besides, the salinity severity in the NDVI index had a growth rate of 72.86%. In turn, XRD studies confirmed the presence of abundant evaporate minerals (Halites, Calcite and Dolomite) corresponding to the values (real numbers) of salinity and mineralogical maps obtained from the Landsat 8 images.

AB Accurate weed identification is a prerequisite for implementing site-specific weed management in crop production. Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.) and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) are two common pigweeds that reduce soybean [Glycine max (L.) Men.] yields in the southeastern United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate leaf multispectral reflectance data as input into the random forest machine learning algorithm to differentiate three soybean varieties (Progeny 4928, Progeny 5160, and Progeny 5460) from Palmer amaranth and redroot pigweed. Leaf reflectance measurements of soybean, Palmer amaranth, and redroot pigweed plants grown in a greenhouse were collected with a plant contact probe attached to a hyperspectral spectroradiometer. Data were obtained at the vegetative growth stage of the plants on two dates, June 30, 2014, and September 17, 2014. The hyperspectral data were aggregated to sixteen multispectral bands (viz. coastal, blue, green, yellow, red, red-edge, near-infrared 1 and 2, and shortwave-infrared 1-8) mimicking those recorded by the WorldView-3 satellite sensor. Classifications were binary, meaning one soybean variety versus one weed tested per classification. Random forest classification accuracies were determined with a confusion matrix, incorporating user's, producer's, and overall accuracies and the kappa coefficient. User's, producer's, and overall accuracies of the soybean weed classifications ranged from 93.8% to 100%. Kappa results (values of 0.93-0.97) indicated an excellent agreement between the classes predicted by the models and the actual reference data. Shortwave-infrared bands were ranked the most important variables for distinguishing the pigweeds from the soybean varieties. These results suggest that random forest and leaf multispectral reflectance data could be used as tools to differentiate soybean from two pig weeds with a potential application of this technology in site-specific weed management programs.

AB Soil erosion reduces crop productivity and creates negative impacts on water quality. Soil erosion by water has become a problem worldwide and as concerns about the environment continue to grow, soil erosion remains a very active area of scientific research. In this study, based on advanced remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, the influences of precipitation, soil, topography and vegetation on soil erosion sensitivity are evaluated. An index system and the classification standard for soil erosion sensitivity assessment in the Tongbai-Dabie Mountainous area are established with soil erosion sensitivity being evaluated and analyzed in order to provide a scientific basis for controlling soil erosion and for making sound ecological engineering decisions. According to the regional conditions, sensitivity is classified into five levels: insensitive, mild, moderate, high and extreme. The distribution of erosion sensitivity for the region is analyzed and the various impacts are discussed. The results show that the sensitivity of the Tongbai-Dabie Mountainous area to soil erosion is relatively high, with 4634% of the total area above the moderate level, and 44.30% and 9.36% rated at the mild and insensitive levels, respectively. In regards to the spatial distribution, the sensitivity levels decrease from south to north, with highly sensitive areas found mainly in the south in the areas of Jinzhai, Huoshan, Shangcheng, Yuexi, and Shucheng. The distribution of soil erosion sensitivity levels was very consistent with the intensity of soil erosion. Areas of high sensitivity are found to have severe areas of soil erosion, indicating that regional soil erosion is highly influenced by natural factors, although in some areas it is evident that the impact of human activities has played a significant role in exacerbating the problem.

AB A study was conducted to estimate the runoff in urbanized zone using Soil Conservation Services Curve Number (SCS-CN) method through remote sensing and GIS techniques. In this study, the region was identified as Cochin Corporation (Kerala State, India) with an aerial extent of 96.44 km(2). The spatial and non-spatial data were collected from different sources, and the thematic layers of soil hydrologic group and land-use maps were prepared and overlaid with one other. The overlaid output results were assigned by curve numbers with respect to soil and land-use categories, and the CN map was prepared with the help of Visual Basic (VB) language in ArcGIS platform. Through supervised classifications, 13 different land-use classes were identified from Quickbird data for the year of 2005 and 2010. The most prominent land-use classes were water bodies, residential, mixed crops, commercial and industrial, and 3 types of soil hydrologic groups were identified namely A, B, and C categories. The B group is most prominent occupying 60 km(2) of the study area. The CN map shows the ranges that 92-100 is the major CN area with high runoff potential zone of the study region. At the final stage, the runoff was estimated by the maximum successive rainfall received in this study area in two different years-2005 and 2010 along with their land-use pattern. The runoff model is applied for temporal variation in land-use change, and impact of runoff was studied. The study area showed significant changes in land-use pattern between 2005 and 2010 particularly in the land-use change from agricultural into industrial, commercial, and residential (high density). The area covered by the highest runoff depth with the range of 92-100 CN values increased from 43.87 to 45.32 km(2) from 2005 to 2010. The volume of runoff was increased from 135.56 to 141.49 Mm(3) from 2005 to 2010 due to the land-use change pattern.

AB Potato late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is a major disease worldwide that has a significant economic impact on potato crops, and remote sensing might help to detect the disease in early stages. This study aims to determine changes induced by potato late blight in two parameters of the red and red-edge spectral regions: the red-well point (RWP) and the red-edge point (REP) as a function of the number of days post-inoculation (DPI) at the leaf and canopy levels. The RWP or REP variations were modelled using linear or exponential regression models as a function of the DPI. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify healthy and infected leaves or plants using either the RWP or REP wavelength as well as the reflectances at 668, 705, 717 and 740 nm. Higher variations in the RWP and REP wavelengths were observed for the infected leaves compared to healthy leaves. The linear and exponential models resulted in higher adjusted R-2 for the infected case than for the healthy case. The SVM classifier applied to the reflectance of the red and red-edge bands of the Micasense((R)) Dual-X camera was able to sort healthy and infected cases with both the leaf and canopy measurements, reaching an overall classification accuracy of 89.33% at 3 DPI when symptoms were visible for the first time with the leaf measurements and of 89.06% at 5 DPI, i.e., two days after the symptoms became apparent, with the canopy measurements. The study shows that RWP and REP at leaf and canopy levels allow detecting potato late blight, but these parameters are less efficient to sort healthy and infected leaves or plants than the reflectance at 668, 705, 717 and 740 nm. Future research should consider larger samples, other cultivars and the test of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for field-based detection.

AB The paper suggests a methodology, based on performance metrics, to select the optimal set of input and parameters to be used for the simulation of river flow discharges with a semi-distributed hydrologic model. The model is applied at daily scale in a semi-arid basin of Southern Italy (Carapelle river, basin area: 506 km(2)) for which rainfall and discharge series for the period 2006-2009 are available. A classification of inputs and parameters was made in two subsets: the former - spatially distributed - to be selected among different options, the latter - lumped - to be calibrated. Different data sources of (or methodologies to obtain) spatially distributed data have been explored for the first subset. In particular, the FAO Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves and Thornthwaite equations were tested for the evaluation of reference evapotranspiration that, in semi-arid areas, represents a key role in hydrological modeling. The availability of LAI maps from different remote sensing sources was exploited in order to enhance the characterization of the vegetation state and consequently of the spatio-temporal variation in actual evapotranspiration. Different type of pedotransfer functions were used to derive the soil hydraulic parameters of the area.
   For each configuration of the first subset of data, a manual calibration of the second subset of parameters was carried out. Both the manual calibration of the lumped parameters and the selection of the optimal distributed dataset were based on the calculation and the comparison of different performance metrics measuring the distance between observed and simulated discharge data series.
   Results not only show the best options for estimating reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficients, LAI values and hydraulic properties of soil, but also provide significant insights regarding the use of different performance metrics including traditional indexes such as RMSE, NSE, index of agreement, with the more recent Benchmark Efficiency (Schaefli and Gupta, 2007) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (Gupta et al., 2009).

AB Ethiopia is a largely agrarian country with nearly 85% of its employment coming from agriculture. Nevertheless, it is not known how much land is under cultivation. Mapping land cover at finer resolution and global scales has been particularly difficult in Ethiopia. The study area falls in a region of high mapping complexity with environmental challenges which require higher quality maps. Here, remote sensing is used to classify a large area of the central and northwestern highlands into eight broad land cover classes that comprise agriculture, grassland, woodland/shrub, forest, bare ground, urban/impervious surfaces, water, and seasonal water/marsh areas. We use data from Landsat spectral bands from 2000 to 2011, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its temporal mean and variance, together with a digital elevation model, all at 30-m spatial resolution, as inputs to a supervised classifier. A Support Vector Machines algorithm (SVM) was chosen to deal with the size, variability and non-parametric nature of these data stacks. In post-processing, an image segmentation algorithm with a minimum mapping unit of about 0.5 hectares was used to convert per pixel classification results into an object based final map. Although the reliability of the map is modest, its overall accuracy is 55%encouraging results for the accuracy of agricultural uses at 85% suggest that these methods do offer great utility. Confusion among grassland, woodland and barren categories reflects the difficulty of classifying savannah landscapes, especially in east central Africa with monsoonal-driven rainfall patterns where the ground is obstructed by clouds for significant periods of time. Our analysis also points out the need for high quality reference data. Further, topographic analysis of the agriculture class suggests there is a significant amount of sloping land under cultivation. These results are important for future research and environmental monitoring in agricultural land use, soil erosion, and crop modeling of the Abay basin.

ID DISEASES
AB Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and stripe rust (Puccinia striifounis f. sp. Tritici) are two of the most prevalent and serious winter wheat diseases in the field, which caused heavy yield loss of winter wheat all over the world. It is necessary to quantitatively identify different diseases for spraying specific fungicides. This study examined the potential of quantitative distinction of powdery mildew and yellow rust by using hyperspectral data with continuous wavelet transform at canopy level. Spectral normalization was processing prior to other data analysis, given the differences of the groups in cultivars and soil environment. Then, continuous wavelet features were extracted from normalized spectral bands using continuous wavelet transform. Correlation analysis and independent t-test were used conjunctively to obtain sensitive spectral bands and continuous wavelet features of 350 similar to 1300 nm, and then, principal component analysis was done to eliminate the redundancy of the spectral features. After that, Fisher linear discriminant models of powdery mildew, stripe rust and normal sample were built based on the principal components of SBs, WFs, and the combination of SBs & WFs, respectively. Finally, the methods of leave-one-out and 55 samples which have no share in model building were used to validate the models. The accuracies of classification were analyzed, it was indicated that the overall accuracies with 92.7% and 90.4% of the models based on WFs, were superior to those of SFs with 65.5% and 61.5%; However, the classification accuracies of Fisher 80-55 were higher but no different than leave-one-out cross validation model, which was possibly related to randomness of training samples selection. The overall accuracies with 94.6% and 91.1% of the models based on SBs & WFs were the highest; The producer' accuracies of powdery mildew and healthy samples based on SBs & WFs were improved more than 10% than those of WFs in Fisher 80-55. Focusing on the discriminant accuracy of different disease, yellow rust can be discriminated in the model based on both WFs and SBs & WFs with higher accuracy; the user' accuracy and producer' accuracy were all up to 100%. The results show great potential of continuous wavelet features in discriminating different disease stresses, and provide theoretical basis for crop disease identification in wide range using remote sensing image.

ID SIMULATION
AB It is well recognized that aggregation of the inhomogeneous data for soils, management, and weather within a land unit for crop simulation. plays a key role in the scaling-up task of crop simulation at regional scales. While the other spatial data could be obtained at a desired level, weather data might not be available in mountainous regions where the production system is, comprised of many small farms. This study was carried. out to develop a scaling-up scheme of a plot-based crop model to an area-based rice production forecasting system suitable for the Korean situation, with an emphasis on the weather data preparation. Daily meteorological surfaces on a I x I km grid spacing were generated by spatial interpolation of 63 point observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration network. Potential effects of elevation on daily temperature were implemented by applying a seasonal lapse rate function developed for the terrain. A land cover classification scheme based on a satellite data analysis was used to identify those pixels corresponding to paddy rice fields, and an empirically determined land cover effect (cooling) was applied to-those pixels to obtain the final temperature surface over rice paddies. The rice paddy pixels falling within a given cultivation zone units (CZU) were extracted from the temperature surface to calculate the average weather representing that CZU. The other weather variables were interpolated by an inverse distance weighting. By this procedure, the spatially explicit climatic data set for crop simulation (daily maximum/minimum temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation) was prepared for 1455 CZU's-making up the coterminous South Korea. Soil characteristics and management information representing each CZU were available from the Rural Development Administration of Korea. CERES-rice, a rice crop growth simulation model, was calibrated to have genetic characteristics pertinent to domestic cultivars in Korea. The model was run to predict rice production of 162 crop-reporting districts for the 3 years (1997-1999) during which official production statistics are available. The simulation was done with the past weather data as of September 15 each year, which is about a month earlier than the actual harvest date. Simulated yields of the 1455 CZUs were aggregated into the corresponding 162 crop reporting districts by acreage-weighted summation, and compared with the reported yield and production. Forecast yields were less sensitive to the inter-annual climate variation than the reported yields, and there was a relatively weak correlation between the forecast and the reported yields. Projected production of rice for each crop reporting district, which is the product of yield and acreage, was close to the reported production with the r(2) values over 0.97 in all 3 years.

AB One of the most challenging aspects of obtaining detailed and accurate land-use and land-cover (LULC) maps is the availability of representative field data for training and validation. In this manuscript, we evaluate the use of the Eurostat Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018 data to generate a detailed LULC map with 19 crop type classes and two broad categories for woodland and shrubland, and grassland. The field data were used in combination with Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data covering Europe. First, spatially and temporally consistent S2 image composites of (1) spectral reflectances, (2) a selection of spectral indices, and (3) several bio-geophysical indicators were created for the year 2018. From the large number of features, the most important were selected for classification using two machine-learning algorithms (support vector machine and random forest). Results indicated that the 19 crop type classes and the two broad categories could be classified with an overall accuracy (OA) of 77.6%, using independent data for validation. Our analysis of three methods to select optimum training data showed that by selecting the most spectrally different pixels for training data, the best OA could be achieved, and this already using only 11% of the total training data. Comparing our results to a similar study using Sentinel-1 (S1) data indicated that S2 can achieve slightly better results, although the spatial coverage was slightly reduced due to gaps in S2 data. Further analysis is ongoing to leverage synergies between optical and microwave data.

AB Savanna landscapes are vitally important in providing both ecological and economic services that sustain local livelihoods and national economies, particularly for sub-Saharan African countries whose economies are mainly agrarian. Development prospects in savanna landscapes are however dependent on actions to avoid and to slow or reverse degradation and that are aided with a clear understanding of trends in land use/cover changes, their causes and implications for conservation. We analysed land use/cover changes based on three Landsat satellite images (1984, 1995 and 2000/2001) and the influence of human utilization on the changes in an equatorial African savanna, central Uganda, for the period 1984-2000/2001. The land cover classification and change analysis clearly identified the dominant land cover types, revealing a severe reduction in woodland cover with dense woodlands decreasing by 64%, over a 17-year period. Consequently, medium woodland, open woodland and cultivation/settlements areas cover increased by 31%, 3% and 80%, respectively. The cover change analysis results were corroborated with interview results that also attributed the woodland cover loss to increasing commercial charcoal production, expanding livestock grazing, subsistence crop cultivation and an insecure land use tenure system. Indeed, the major land use types in the savanna are charcoal production, shifting crop cultivation and livestock rearing. The decreasing woody vegetation cover threatens the savanna's ability to continue providing ecosystems services to support the livelihoods of people who mainly depend on natural resources and are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

AB The work was carried out in the area of "Los Numeros", Guisa municipality, Granma province, Cuba. This area forms one of the largest rural councils in the territory, where forestry plays a fundamental role, with an impact on more than 80 % of the area. The objective of the research was to evaluate the spatial-temporal dynamics of the change in vegetation cover that occurred between 1986 and 2016 in lands under a forest management regime. To this end, through the supervised classification of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images, the cover was catalogued into four occupation categories (forest; shrub; grassland or crop; and naked-soil). Information from the forest management project of the Granma Agroforestry Enterprise was used, where the characteristics of the plots are presented. The result was that, during the period analyzed, 20.91 km(2) of shrub areas and 6.38 km(2) of grasslands, pastures or crops decreased, as well as 6.65 km(2) of naked soil, while 33.94 km(2) of forest clearly represented the advance of the forest cover limit. In terms of the persistence of the forest category, the Mountain Rainforest and Pine Forest formations were the most distinctive and, in relation to the persistence of the shrub category, the semi-deciduous formation on limestone soil and mountain rainforest were the most represented. The 54 % of the total recovery was shown in the Pinar del Rio. The reforestation plans undertaken during the period analysed have a major influence on the recovery of the coverage of this formation.

AB This study aims to identify the vulnerable landscape areas using landslide frequency ratio and land-use change associated soil erosion hazard by employing geo-informatics techniques and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model. Required datasets were collected from multiple sources, such as multi-temporal Landsat images, soil data, rainfall data, land-use land-cover (LULC) maps, topographic maps, and details of the past landslide incidents. Landsat satellite images from 2000, 2010, and 2019 were used to assess the land-use change. Geospatial input data on rainfall, soil type, terrain characteristics, and land cover were employed for soil erosion hazard classification and mapping. Landscape vulnerability was examined on the basis of land-use change, erosion hazard class, and landslide frequency ratio. Then the erodible hazard areas were identified and prioritized at the scale of river distribution zones. The image analysis of Sabaragamuwa Province in Sri Lanka from 2000 to 2019 indicates a significant increase in cropping areas (17.96%) and urban areas (3.07%), whereas less dense forest and dense forest coverage are significantly reduced (14.18% and 6.46%, respectively). The average annual soil erosion rate increased from 14.56 to 15.53 t/ha/year from year 2000 to 2019. The highest landslide frequency ratios are found in the less dense forest area and cropping area, and were identified as more prone to future landslides. The river distribution zones Athtanagalu Oya (A-2), Kalani River-south (A-3), and Kalani River- north (A-9), were identified as immediate priority areas for soil conservation.

ID AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS
AB A new automatic stratification method utilizing United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) geospatial Cropland Data Layers was recently implemented in NASS operations. Recent research findings indicated that using the automated stratification method significantly improved area sampling frame stratification accuracies in intensively cropped areas (> 15% cultivation) and overall stratification accuracies when compared to traditional stratification based on visual interpretation of aerial photography or satellite data, while reducing the cost of area frame construction (Boryan et al., 2014). Though the new automated stratification method has improved stratification efficiency, objectivity, and accuracy in the intensively cropped areas, it inherits the Cropland Data Layer classification errors and has lower accuracies in low or non-agricultural areas. This implies that the automated stratification process is not a perfect solution to directly replace the NASS traditional stratification method for area frame construction operationally. This paper describes a hybrid approach: an operational area frame construction process that integrates the automated stratification results with manual editing/review methods. New 2014-2015 NASS area frames for South Dakota, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina were successfully built using the new integrated operational process. The improvement measures used to assess the traditional, automated and hybrid methods for area frame construction include: 1) area frame stratification accuracy; 2) mean stratum primary sampling unit size, mean stratum percent cultivation and stratum standard deviations; 3) the variances of key estimators; and 4) labor cost. The seven updated area frames delivered significant improvements in objectivity, operational efficiency, and frame accuracy, based on 2013-2015 June Area Survey reported data.

AB This paper, for the first time, proposes to apply USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) geospatial data for stratifying U.S. agricultural land. Anew automated method is proposed to stratify the NASS state level area sampling frames (ASFs) by automatically calculating percent cultivation at the primary sampling unit (PSU) level based on the CDL data. The NASS CDLs are 30-56.0 m raster-formatted, georeferenced, cropland cover classifications derived from satellite data. The CDL stratification experiment was successfully conducted for Oklahoma, Ohio, Virginia, Georgia, and Arizona. The stratification accuracies of the traditional (visual interpretation) and new automated CDL stratification methods were compared based on 2010 June Area Survey data. Experimental results indicated that the CDL stratification method achieved higher accuracies in the intensively cropped areas, while the traditional method achieved higher accuracies in low or nonagricultural areas. The differences in the accuracies were statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. It was found that using multiyear composite, CDL-based cultivated layers did not improve stratification accuracies as compared to the results of single-year CDL data. Two applications of the CDL-automated stratification method in official USDA NASS operations are described. The novelty of the proposed method was using geospatial CDL data to objectively and automatically compute percent cultivation of the ASF PSUs as compared to the traditional method that subjectively determines percent cultivation using visual interpretation of satellite data. This proposed new CDL-based process improved efficiency, objectivity, and accuracy as compared to the traditional stratification method.

AB The accuracy of soil water content (WC) interpretation from satellites and its application in hydrological modelling is dependent on our understanding of the effects of field-scale surface soil properties on soil WC variability. Soil texture, surface roughness and surface residue were evaluated for their influence on soil WC variability with data obtained from satellite ground verification sampling near Carman, Manitoba, within a 28 km(2) area. Over the course of five selected dates from 23 April to 18 May 2008, soil WC and other physical variables were obtained in 38 agricultural fields covering three distinct soil textural classifications. Within each field, at each of 16 sampling locations, four individual soil WC measurements were taken, including sampling points with and without the influence of crop residue left on the soil surface. A principal component analysis and multiple linear regression both identified soil texture as the primary physical process controlling variability in soil WC and coefficient of variation (CV) among fields during the campaign. Residue cover was also a significant factor representing a second principal component that explained 37% of variability in average soil WC and contributed to 31% of variability in CV. Whereas soil texture predominated in soil WC and CV on most sampling dates, residue cover was of equal significance as texture in dry soils. This study identified specific effects of tillage and residue management contributing to field-scale soil WC variability that could contribute significant improvements to interpretation of remotely sensed soil WC and subsequent scaling efforts over agricultural regions.

AB Many of edible bananas (Kluai in Thai) associated with Musa balbisiana are diversified in Southeast Asia, and their genomes vary from diploid to tetraploid. This research aimed to examine the chromosome number and karyotype of certain local bananas for their classification and crop improvement. Root tips of 20 banana accessions were collected from the banana germplasm collection at Pak Chong Research Station and Department of Horticulture, Kasetsart University, stained with Feulgen and then observed under light microscope. The results revealed that the bananas classified as BB group (2n=22) were 'Tani Dam', 'Tani I-san' and 'Tani Nuea'. The banana in BBB group (2n=33) was 'Thepphanom'. The bananas in AAB group (2n=33) were 'Roi Wi', 'Nom Sao', 'Sam Duean' (Phichit), 'Nam Lek' (Songkhla) and 'Nam Phat'. The bananas in ABB group (2n=33), were 'Namwa ;Dam', 'Namwa Ngoen', 'Namwa Ubon', 'Namwa Mali Ong', 'Namwa Sai Daeng', 'Hin', 'Namwo', 'Nang Phaya', 'Hak Muk Khiao' and 'Hak Muk Thong'. The banana in ABBB group (2n=44) was 'Theppharot'. These genomes were varied in chromosome size ranging from 0.83 to 3.79 microns. The karyotypes in all groups were composed of metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes. The satellite was found on the first chromosomal pair in all genomic groups, but found on the second chromosomal pair only in 'Roi Wi', 'Nang Phaya', 'Hak Muk Khiao', 'Hak Muk Thong'. There was no satellite observed in 'Tani I-san' and 'Tani Nuea'. Our results suggested that karyotypic variation is related to B genome.

AB The recently launched Sentinel-1 satellite with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor onboard offers a powerful tool for irrigation monitoring under various weather conditions, with high spatial and temporal resolution. This research discusses the potential of different metrics calculated from the Sentinel-1 time series for mapping irrigated fields. A methodology for irrigation mapping using SAR data is proposed. The study is performed using VV (vertical-vertical) and VH (vertical-horizontal) polarizations over an agricultural site in Urgell, Catalunya (Spain). With field segmentation information from SIGPAC (the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels), the backscatter intensities are averaged within each field. From the Sentinel-1 time series for each field, the statistics and metrics, including the mean value, the variance of the signal, the correlation length, and the fractal dimension, are analyzed. With the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the classification of irrigated crops, irrigated trees, and non-irrigated fields is performed with the metrics vector. The results derived from the SVM are validated with ground truthing from SIGPAC over the whole study area, with a good overall accuracy of 81.08%. Random Forest (RF) machine classification is also tested in this study, which gives an accuracy of around 82.2% when setting the tree depth at three. The methodology is based only on SAR data, which makes it applicable to all areas, even with frequent cloud cover, but this method may be less robust when irrigation is less dominated to soil moisture change.

AB Knowledge of the fascinating world of DNA repeats is continuously being enriched by newly identified elements and their hypothetical or well-established biological relevance. Genomic approaches can be used for comparative studies of major repeats in any group of genomes, regardless of their size and complexity. Such studies are particularly fruitful in large genomes, and useful mainly in crop plants where they provide a rich source of molecular markers or information on indispensable genomic components (e.g., telomeres, centromeres, or ribosomal RNA genes). Surprisingly, in Allium species, a comprehensive comparative study of repeats is lacking. Here we provide such a study of two economically important species, Allium cepa (onion), and A. sativum (garlic), and their distantly related A. ursinum (wild garlic). We present an overview and classification of major repeats in these species and have paid specific attention to sequence conservation and copy numbers of major representatives in each type of repeat, including retrotransposons, rDNA, or newly identified satellite sequences. Prevailing repeats in all three studied species belonged to Ty3/gypsy elements, however they significantly diverged and we did not detect them in common clusters in comparative analysis. Actually, only a low number of clusters was shared by all three species. Such conserved repeats were for example 5S and 45S rDNA genes and surprisingly a specific and quite rare Ty1/copia lineage. Species-specific long satellites were found mainly in A. cepa and A. sativum. We also show in situ localization of selected repeats that could potentially be applicable as chromosomal markers, e.g., in interspecific breeding.

AB In the summer of 2012, the central plains of the United States experienced one of its most severe droughts on record. This study examines the meteorological impacts of irrigation during this drought through observations and model simulations using the Community Land Model coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. A simple parameterization of irrigation processes is added into the WRF Model. In addition to keeping soil moisture in irrigated areas at a minimum of 50% of soil moisture hold capacity, this irrigation scheme has the following new features: 1) accurate representation of the spatial distribution of irrigation area in the study domain by using a MODIS-based land surface classification with 250-m pixel size and 2) improved representation of the time series of leaf area index (LAI) values derived from crop modeling and satellite observations in both irrigated and nonirrigated areas. Several numerical sensitivity experiments are conducted. The WRF-simulated temperature field when including soil moisture and LAI modification within the model is shown to be most consistent with ground and satellite observations, all indicating a temperature decrease of 2-3K in irrigated areas relative to the control run. Modification of LAI in irrigated and dryland areas led to smaller changes, with a 0.2-K temperature decrease in irrigated areas and up to a 0.5-K temperature increase in dryland areas. Furthermore, the increased soil moisture and modified LAI are shown to lead to statistically significant increases in surface divergence and surface pressure and to decreases in planetary boundary layer height over irrigated areas.

AB A fast and efficient estimation of crop biophysical parameters is significantly important inmany agricultural, ecological, and meteorological applications. This study investigated the potential of airborne LiDAR and satellite GF-1 data for estimating three biophysical parameters of maize: 1) leaf area index (LAI); 2) average canopy height (H-canopy); and 3) aboveground biomass (AGB) during the peak growing season. First, classification data of maize was produced using normalized surface height, GF-1 NDVI, and terrain slope through decision-making. Second, four representative remotely sensed (RS) metrics which have been widely used in forest studies were tested to develop multiplicative models with similar shapes for estimating each biophysical parameter of maize, respectively. Third, the estimation results were obtained and validated through leave-one-out cross-validation method yielding a root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.37 for LAI, 0.17 m for H-canopy, and 0.49 kg/m(2) for AGB. Finally, contributions to the estimation models from each RS metric were analyzed, and spatial patterns of the biophysical parameters across the entire study area were mapped. Based on these results, the following conclusions were drawn. 1) The four selected metrics from airborne LiDAR and satellite GF-1 data are also applicable and promising in estimating biophysical parameters of maize during the peak growing season. 2) Multiplicative model was proved to be a fast, simple but effective alternative by combining LiDAR-derived structure information and spectral content from GF-1 NDVI. These conclusions provide valuable information for estimation of biophysical parameters of maize during the peak growing season.

AB This work was performed in the Paraiba do Sul basin, within the limits of the Sao Paulo state, southeastern Brazil, in order to assess the dynamics of the land-use and land-cover changes at the Paraiba do Sul river's floodplains between 1985 and 2016. We focused on investigating the development of agricultural areas used for the production of wetland rice and of areas featuring artificial lakes produced by sand mining. We mapped the land cover in 1985 using images made by the Landsat 5 satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors, which were segmented to produce vectors featuring homogeneous characteristics, and which were classified by means of visual interpretation. Similarly, we applied the maximum likelihood classification and used spectral curve inserts and adjustments to study and analyze the same area using a Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) image made in 2016. Our results show significant reduction of areas used for rice crops, and increase in areas featuring sand-mining pits. The rice crop areas decreased approximately 43% from 24,131.4 ha in 1985 to 13,789.8 ha in 2016. Over this 30-year period, the area covered by sand-mining lakes increased from 615 ha to 3,876 ha (+630%), and the number of lakes increased from 54 to 316. Sand mining and urbanization are the main factors causing the reduction in wetland rice areas. The absence of environmental management actions at the basin interferes with the rice production, which depends on the Paraiba do Sul river's floodplains.

AB Cotton is an important cash crop in the world, as the main source of natural and renewable fiber for textiles. Accurate and timely monitoring of the cotton distribution is crucial for cotton cultivation management and international trade. However, most of the previous researches on cotton identification using remotely sensed images are highly dependent on training samples, and the collection of samples is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this limitation, a new index, termed as Cotton Mapping Index (CMI), was developed in this study for automatic cotton mapping using time series of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data. Four sites in the United States (U.S.) and four sites in China were selected to develop and assess the performance of the CMI. The spectral characteristics derived from Sentinel-2 and backscattering coefficients derived from Sentinel-1 for cotton and non-cotton crops during the cotton growth period were analyzed. Considering the phenology differences of crops in different regions, the features at an adaptive window were adopted to construct the CMI. The results showed that at the peak greenness period, the multiplication of red-edge 1 and red-edge 2 band for cotton samples were much larger than those for non-cotton samples, whereas the spectral angle at the red band as well as the absolute values of backscattering coefficients in vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarization for cotton samples were much smaller than those for non-cotton samples. Based on these findings, the CMI was developed to identify cotton cultivated area within the cropland area. The overall accuracy of classification results for the sites in the U.S. was higher than 81.20%, and the mean relative error for the sites in Xinjiang of China was 26.69%. The CMI, which incorporated optical and radar features, had a better performance than the indices using optical features solely. The advantage of the CMI over supervised classifiers (i.e., k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine and random forest) is that no training samples are required. Moreover, the cotton distribution map can be obtained before the harvest using the CMI. These results indicated the potential of the CMI for cotton mapping. The applicability of CMI in other regions with different cropping systems and crop types needs to be further assessed in the future study.

DE Curvelet; Wavelet; co-occurrence texture; watermark; Satellite; texture;
   Robust; Classification
AB In this paper, a robust invisible watermarking algorithm for satellite imagery using Curvelet Transform is proposed. Haralick Co-occurrence texture features [1] are used to identify the area for watermarking in the host image. Host image is tiled into smaller non-overlapping blocks. Based on the Haralick texture feature chosen, blocks with high value of chosen texture feature were selected for embedding. Thus, multiple watermarks are embedded in any given image. There are some unstable Curvelet coefficients so a little change of the image will result in a big change of these coefficients. These unstable factors can influence the extracting of watermark. Hence selection of position of embedding in the transformed domain plays a very important role in robustness of the embedding process. This algorithm encourages use of edges and curves for embedding watermarks. The experimental results show that watermark using proposed algorithm is robust against common attacks like Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Tint adjustments, Low pass Filtering, JPEG Compression attack, Gaussian Noise attack and Laplacian Filtering, Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Image Cropping, Geometric Attacks like scaling and Rotation. Use of SURF features [2] too ensures robustness to geometric attacks. The effect of watermarking on the classification accuracy is also studied.

AB Estimation of soil moisture variables is very important in agriculture studies such as precision irrigation and its management, so knowledge of the variation would be highly beneficial. Effective irrigation is possible with regular monitoring of soil and plant water conditions and with the forecasting of future crop water requirement. This study explored the capability of indices for estimating soil moisture as an indicator of detection irrigation time in sugarcane farms located in the southwest of Iran. For this goal, Landsat 8 satellite images were got from May until September 2015. Concurrent with the satellite pass times, field measurements include soil moisture (SM) and canopy temperature was done at the predefined points in sugarcane farms. These farms were selected with different age and irrigation days. Various indices were calculated using the combination of optical and thermal infrared wavelengths, and their relationship to the amount of SM was studied. According to the results of this research, vegetation indices based on optical bands do not show a good coefficient of determination (R-2). Results showed that soil moisture computed by crop water stress index (CWSI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) have a similar trend, which showed that both indices can be used for irrigation scheduling, although they had some differences for computed soil moisture, TVDI had better correlation than to CWSI. TVDI indicated a good correlation with SM measurement data whichR(2)values range from 0.35 to 0.66, as well as inharmonious with the spatial distribution of (SM). It showed (RMSE) less than 0.2. Comparing recorded irrigation and (SM) in the farms shows that (SM) can be classified into three classes: low soil moisture (0.1 < SM <= 0.15), medium soil moisture (0.15 < SM <= 0.2) and high soil moisture (0.2 < SM <= 0.25). This classification can be utilized for precision irrigation scheduling in soils with heavy and semi-heavy texture (silty clay and silty clay loam). All of the results demonstrated that the TVDI can be utilized for assessment SM and determine irrigation time in agriculture lands, without each other in situ measurement of data.

TI A SPOT SURVEY OF WILD-RICE IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A survey of the areal extent of wild rice around three lakes in northern Minnesota has been conducted. Wild rice is a desirable natural marsh grass that is sensitive not only to the phosphorus washed from farm, urban, and industrial areas, but also to water level. Both wild birds that migrate along the waterway routes and the Chippewa Indians living there use it as a food staple. The objective of the survey was to produce a geographic information system map from the remotely sensed Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terra (SPOT) data, showing identification and location of the wild rice on the Chippewa reservation and listing its acreage. The approach used was the technique of supervised spectral classification. The results surprisingly show three distinct and separate spectral populations of wild rice. Although it is unrealistic that different varieties are growing in close proximity, some possible causes for the results are that (1) dissimilar land cover backgrounds are causing different mixed pixel responses, (2) varying crop canopies are causing different detected radiance, and (3) varying water content of the vegetation is causing radiance differences.

TI Obtaining high-resolution synthetic soil imagery for topsoil mapping
SO REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Detailed soil maps contribute to the understanding of agricultural and food value chains. PlanetScope satellite constellations have high spatial and temporal resolution and could be used to develop Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI) at specific dates of field crops calendar. This work aimed to derive a SYSI from PlanetScope time series and estimate soil clay content, an important attribute related to several soil functions. The normalization process was applied to make the radiometries of the different Doves' images compatible and, subsequently, land cover classification was performed to select the bare soil class, obtaining the SYSI-Planet. The clay content was predicted for 2337 topsoil samples using the SYSI-Planet and Random Forest algorithm. The normalization of PlanetScope images were based on reference images, which mitigated the radiometric differences from acquisition dates and different radiometric calibrations. SYSI-Planet resulted in an excellent clay content prediction, resulting in a coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.93 and Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) equal to 70.90. The predicted clay mapped revealed spatial patterns with a high spatial resolution (similar to 3 m), which can enhance precise agricultural management.

AB Frequently, soil compaction limits the yield of grain crops in mechanized lands, and its spatial distribution in the cropland is usually regionalized. In an area managed under longterm no-tillage, we investigated the relationship between soil penetration resistance (PR) and soybean yield, the effectiveness of types of chisel plows, and their effect on soybean yield. The soil from the plateau region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, was classified as a clayey Oxisol. The climate is subtropical (Cfa - Koppen classification), with annual rainfall of 1,750 mm and mean annual temperature of 18.7 degrees C. A completely randomized block experimental design was used with four treatments and two replications. The treatments, arranged in parallel strips of 100 x 20 m, were: a) site-specific chisel plow with variable depth according to soil penetration resistance (PR) (ESEV); b) conventional chisel plow (EC) with fixed depth; c) site-specific chisel plow with fixed depth (ESEF); d) control - without chisel plowing (SE). To evaluate PR, a digital penetrometer with georeferenced readings with a 50 x 50 m grid was used, with two evaluation periods. Soybean grain yield was obtained through a combine equipped with a yield sensor and GPS satellite receiver. A mean value of 1.4 MPa was observed for RP after cover crop management practices and a mean value of 2.1 after harvest. The RP reading after cover crop management and soybean grain yield exhibited poor correlation (r(2) = -0.297; p<0.05). The PR values of 3.0 and 5.0 MPa resulted in decreases of approximately 10 and 38% of soybean grain yields, respectively. Chisel plowing, regardless of the piece type of equipment used, did not increase soybean yield compared to the control without soil tillage. This result was attributed to the frequent rainfall and good physical and hydraulic conditions of long-term no-till.

AB Few countries are using space-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to operationally produce national-scale maps of their agricultural landscapes. For the past ten years, Canada has integrated C-band SAR with optical satellite data to map what crops are grown in every field, for the entire country. While the advantages of SAR are well understood, the barriers to its operational use include the lack of familiarity with SAR data by agricultural end-user agencies and the lack of a 'blueprint' on how to implement an operational SAR-based mapping system. This research reviewed order of operations for SAR data processing and how order choice affects processing time and classification outcomes. Additionally this research assessed the impact of speckle filtering by testing three filter types (adaptive, multi-temporal and multi-resolution) at varying window sizes for three study sites with different average field sizes. The Touzi multi-resolution filter achieved the highest overall classification accuracies for all three sites with varying window sizes, and with only a small (< 2%) difference in accuracy relative to the Gamma MaximumA Posteriori(MAP) adaptive filter which had similar window sizes across sites. As such, the assessment of order of operations for noise reduction and terrain correction was completed using the Gamma MAP adaptive filter. This research found there was no difference in classification accuracies regardless of whether noise reduction was applied before or after terrain correction. However, implementing the terrain correction as the first operation resulted in a 10 to 50% increase in processing time. This is an important consideration when designing and delivering operational systems, especially for large geographies like Canada where hundreds of SAR images are required. These findings will encourage country-wide, regional and global food monitoring initiatives to consider SAR sensors as an important source of data to operationally map agricultural production.

ID KNAPWEED CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; AGREEMENT
AB Ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, is an annual plant, the pollen of which is responsible for respiratory allergies. In 2005, these allergies affected up to 20% of the population in parts of the department of Rhne. This is a major health problem for six of the eight departments of the Rhne-Alpes region (Ain, Ardche, Drme, Isre, Loire and Rhne). Our objective was to validate a method to map ragweed infestation in a village and then to extend this experiment to a department. Using methods developed by Auda et al. (2002a), we undertook a survey of ragweed infestation at the end of July 2005 in the village of Estrablin (Isre). Plots of land were registered in a Geographical Information System, with indications of crop type and ragweed infestation included in each plot. The sample area covered 3650km2 and constituted 30% of the total area of the village. The data were used to validate a SPOT 5 multispectral satellite image captured on 16 August 2005. Analysis of the ground data confirmed the extent of the ragweed infestation. More than 90% of the sample area was found to be infested. The image processing was based on crossing the crop type with the degree of infestation, using maximum likelihood classification. The accuracy of the method of detection used was demonstrated by the percentage of correctly classified pixels (45%), the reasons for confusion and the clarity of the visual representations. The success of our approach is highly influenced by the availability of high-quality images. Its feasibility, which is linked therefore to technical constraints, is examined in relation to space agency programmes.

AB Europe is covered by distinct climatic zones which include semiarid, the Mediterranean, humid subtropical, marine, humid continental, subarctic, and highland climates. Land use and land cover change have been well documented in the past 200 years across Europe 'where land cover grassland and cropland together make up 39%2. In recent years, the agricultural sector has been affected by abnormal weather events. Climate change will continue to change weather patterns, for some regions, this will have a positive impact. For other regions, it will be negative. Hail, heavy rainfall, floods, and droughts may lead to a reduction in agricultural land in some regions with an additional impact on biodiversity. For that reason, major climatic and hydrological variables such as temperature, precipitation, vegetation index, and soil moisture must be regularly monitored and the trends of their deviations from the normal must be observed. This research investigates the quantity of potato production in the future in two stages. In the first stage, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)3 models are used for yield and soil moisture forecasting. The models are trained on a dataset acquired in time series from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)4 satellite from 2010 to 2019 and are compared by statistics on potato production from EUROSTAT5 at the national scale. In the second stage, the approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM)6 architecture of Sentinel 2 Vegetation Index satellite imagery together with weather and Sentinel 1 surface soil moisture information for the EU-28 member countries by season 2018 for single potato fields. Agricultural statistical data such as crop calendar, map, production area, yield, and acreage are collected from Eurostat while vector data collection from Land Use and Land Cover Survey (LUCAS) and Land Cover from national to small scale agriculture (CORINE)8. The ARIMA output performances measure Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE for soil moisture forecasting is 0.3792, 0.2816, 0.2679, 0.2110, and 0.1791 for East, West, South, North, and Centre EU respectively. MSE for potato yield forecasting is 0.0954, 0.081, 0.0589, 0.0447, and 0.0199 for North, Centre, East, South, and West EU respectively. The number of known crop field areas and the distance between them are different for each country and this alters the dimension of the classification input. Two countries of EU-28 do not contain information on potato location while the input dimensions of another two are too big to perform. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis of SVM has been implemented for a total of 24 states. The classification accuracies for kernel Radial Basis function are 98.53% in Austria, 99.39% in Centre of UK, 99.64% in Italia, 99.12% in Bulgaria and Greece, 99.43% in Sweden for Centre, West, South, East, and North EU, respectively, with the Sentinel Vegetation Index. The classification accuracies change with the amount of ground -truth data. The results show that some geographical and socio-economic biases like the chemical composition of the soil or the degree of automation in the agricultural sector are influencing in the statistical analysis.

AB Determination of cotton and maize cultivated areas with multi-temporal satellite images using vegetation indices is the main objective of this research. Study area was located on Sanliurfa province, Turkey, which hosts huge amount of agricultural production of cotton and maize in spring-summer season with its suitable and effective irrigation system. The Landsat 8 OLI multi-temporal images acquired with 16-day interval were used to identify cultivated areas in the study area. Image acquisition dates from 30 April 2015 to 21 September 2015 completely covers the phenological development period of cultivated crop types. Terrain corrected images were radiometrically calibrated to produce Top of Atmosphere (ToA) reflectance images, in order to reduce the atmospheric and illumination effects, thus providing efficient multi-temporal analysis. ToA reflectance images were then used in vegetation index (VI) production. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were used in this research as vegetation suppression and data dimension reduction methods. Then VI image stacks were classified with pixel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and results were compared with statistical production database to evaluate the effectiveness of broadband VIs in cultivated area and crop pattern detection. Results of the analysis provided that, GNDVI based dataset provided highest accuracies according to areal comparison and point based accuracy assessment. NDVI and TDVI based datasets were ranked as the second with similar accuracy results, while EVI based dataset was in the last place when compared to remaining VI datasets. Additionally, area determination efficiency and classification accuracy for the cotton was higher than the maize nearly in all regions.

AB The present paper describes the methodology and results of assessment of seasonal progress of rice stubble burning for 10 major rice growing districts of Haryana state in India. These 10 districts contribute about 84 per cent of total rice area of the state. As the rice fields are immediately required to be vacated for the sowing of next crop the farmers opt for mechanized harvesting and easy way out of burning the stubbles in the field. Such burning result in release of polluting gases and aerosols. Besides, the heating of the soil kills the useful micro-flora of the soil causing soil degradation. Multi-date AWiFS data from Resourcesat 1 and 2 satellites acquired between October 16, 2013 to November 26, 2013 were used for estimating paddy stubble burning areas at different intervals for the year 2013 crop growing season. In season collected ground truth data using hand held GPS along with field photographs were used to identify paddy stubble burning areas and other land features. Complete enumeration approach and Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised classifier was used for digital analysis. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of each date was also used with other spectral bands of temporal images. To improve the classification accuracy the non-agricultural areas were masked out. The area was estimated by computing pixels under the classified image mask. Progress of paddy stubble burning was estimated at different intervals for the year 2013 using available cloud free multi-date IRS-P6 AWiFS data to identify the crucial period when stubbles burning takes place in major area so that preventive measures can be taken to curb the menace.

ID TROPICAL FORESTS; DEFORESTATION; LANDSCAPES; LABOR
AB Recent studies point to a rapid increase in small-scale deforestation in Amazonia. Where people live along the rivers of the basin, customary shifting cultivation creates a zone of secondary forest, orchards and crop fields around communities in what was once was old-growth terra firme forest. Visible from satellite imagery as a narrow but extensive band of forest disturbance along rivers, this zone is often considered as having been deforested. In this paper we assess forest disturbance and the dynamics of secondary forests around 275 communities along a 725 km transect on the Napo and Amazon Rivers in the Peruvian Amazon. We used high-resolution satellite imagery to define the 'working area' around each community, based on the spatial distribution of forest/field patches and the visible boundary between old-growth and secondary forests. Land cover change was assessed between ca. 1989 and 2015 using CLASlite((TM)) image classification. Statistical analyses using community and household-level data from the Peruvian Amazon Rural Livelihoods and Poverty project identified the predictors of the extent of forest disturbance and the dynamics of secondary forests around communities. Although shifting cultivation is the primary driver of old-growth forest loss, we find that secondary forest cover, which replaces old-growth forests, is stable through time, and that both the area and rate of expansion into old-growth forests are modest when compared to forest conversion in Peru for colonization and plantation development. Our findings challenge the notion that smallholder agriculture along rivers is an important threat to terra firme forests in Amazonia and point to the importance of protecting forests on community lands from loggers, colonists and other outsiders.

AB Cropland expansion is a common strategy for boosting agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) even though it often leads to economic, environmental, and social trade-offs. Ensuring sustainable cropland use and their management is critical for improving food security and preserving ecosystem services. To develop policies and approaches that support sustainable cropland management at national and sub-national scales, there is a need to understand the spatial distribution of cropland expansion (/loss), and any resultant changes in cropland productivity. This is especially important in SSA countries such as Malawi, where spatially explicit assessments of changes in cropland area and cropland productivity are lacking. To address this gap in Malawi, we used multi-source satellite data and socio-economic data, combined with satellite image classification and trend analysis, firstly to quantify spatial changes in cropland area and productivity, and secondly to evaluate potentially available cropland for future expansion. We found evidence of unsustainable cropland use in Malawi, which was demonstrated by: (a) rapid cropland expansion between 2010 and 2019 (increase 8.5% of land area), characterized by an expansion of crop farming into upland areas which indicate increased land scarcity in Malawi; (b) limited potential for future expansion, as approximately only 5% of the total land remained as potentially available cropland (corresponding to 4671 000 ha); and (c) an overall reduction in cropland productivity and a prevalence of increase in soil erosion. Our findings underscore the urgent need for taking measures to promote sustainable cropland use, including by protecting current cropland from further degradation (e.g. Southern Malawi) and improving cropland use planning (e.g. Northern Malawi).

AB Rice production is very important for national food security in China. Time series vegetation indices and phenology-based algorithms have been utilized to map paddy rice fields by identifying the flooding and seedling transplanting phases from multitemporal moderate-resolution (500 m to 1 km) images. Satellite imagery in other electromagnetic spectrum such as microwave region provides supplementary information about land surface characteristics such as soil moisture, which may improve the accuracy of rice mapping. In this study, we developed a method for identifying paddy rice at the regional scale based on the potential relationship between soil moisture and crop growth. Random forest classification optimized by the coordinate descent algorithm was used to generate a 500 m resolution paddy rice map with time series downscaled soil moisture based on Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) images and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of the northern Songnen Plain in Northeast China-one of the major paddy rice cultivation regions in China. A combination of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Phenological Parameters (PH), and Soil Moisture (SM) was used to identify the rice fields during the flooding/transplanting and ripening phases. Two scenarios (EVI + L SWI + PH and EVI + L SWI + PH + SM as the input parameters) were developed to extract the paddy rice from the images. A comparison of the two identification scenarios indicated that the addition of the soil moisture to the combination achieved higher identification accuracy, especially at the junction of the different crop phases. The proposed method could be beneficial to researchers attempting to improve the accuracy of paddy rice identification at regional scale. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Estimating winter wheat straw amount and spatial distribution in Qihe
   County, China, using GF-1 satellite images
SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Crop straw is considered an important renewable energy source. China produces approximately one billion tons of crop straw annually, but 35% of this yield is not used effectively. In this study, a novel method for estimating the regional winter wheat straw yield was developed to promote straw resource recovery. Medium resolution (16 m) GF-1 satellite images of Qihe County were obtained. A weighted normalized difference vegetation index (WNDVI) image of winter wheat based on time-series normalized difference vegetation index values was generated by weighting samples to distinguish winter wheat from other land cover types, such as woodland, bare land, water, settlement, and other cultivated land. Four kernel functions of support vector machines (SVMs) were used for image classification. The linear kernel function with the highest accuracy was selected to construct the extraction model of the winter wheat plantation area in the Qihe County, Shandong Province, China, and the estimation method for total theoretical resources and spatial distribution of winter wheat straw in the region was established. The results show that the winter wheat straw in the Qihe County was mainly concentrated in the central and southern regions followed by the northern region; the central urban districts in the central-north region had the lowest straw concentration. The theoretical total quantity of straw resources of winter wheat in the county was 690497 t; and the theoretical recoverable resource quantity was 504063 t. The error between the estimated data and statistical data was only 1.27%, indicating that SVM and WNDVI can accurately identify winter wheat and estimate the spatial distribution of winter wheat straw in Qihe County.

AB Pressures on the Brazilian Amazon forest have been accentuated by agricultural activities practiced by families encouraged to settle in this region in the 1970s by the colonization program of the government. The aims of this study were to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of land cover and land use (LCLU) in the lower Tapajos region, in the state of Para. We contrast 11 watersheds that are generally representative of the colonization dynamics in the region. For this purpose, Landsat satellite images from three different years, 1986, 2001, and 2009, were analyzed with Geographic Information Systems. Individual images were subject to an unsupervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm available on GRASS. The classes retained for the representation of LCLU in this study were: (1) slightly altered old-growth forest, (2) succession forest, (3) crop land and pasture, and (4) bare soil. The analysis and observation of general trends in eleven watersheds shows that LCLU is changing very rapidly. The average deforestation of old-growth forest in all the watersheds was estimated at more than 30% for the period of 1986 to 2009. The local-scale analysis of watersheds reveals the complexity of LCLU, notably in relation to large changes in the temporal and spatial evolution of watersheds. Proximity to the sprawling city of Itaituba is related to the highest rate of deforestation in two watersheds. The opening of roads such as the Transamazonian highway is associated to the second highest rate of deforestation in three watersheds.

AB Most landscape definitions in the western world are based on soil, climatic, or physiographic features and do not integrate humans as an integral part of the landscape. We present an approach where landscape types have been delineated in southern Quebec, Canada based on current land use where anthropogenic and agricultural activities are concentrated as a practical application of the holistic approach in landscape definition. Landsat-TM satellite images were classified and the 27 habitat classes were regrouped into 5 general land cover classes (cash crop, dairy farming, forest, anthropogenic, wetlands) and overlaid onto soil landscape polygons to characterize natural boundary units. Cluster analyses were used to aggregate these polygons into seven agricultural types of landscape forming a gradient from urban and high-intensity cash crop farming activities to landscapes dominated by a mosaic of agriculture and forested areas. Multivariate analyses of raw data and of socio-economic and farming practices variables were used to describe the defined types of landscape and these were projected over three established land classification systems of southern Quebec (Canadian ecoregions, North American Bird Conservation Initiative regions and Corn Heat Unit regions) to compare their similarity in terms of land cover and for planning of future ecological studies. Because agricultural landscapes are highly dynamic, they are bound to undergo changes in the near future. Our landscape delineation may serve as an experimental setup where landscape dynamics and wildlife populations and community structures could be monitored. Because the information we used to delineate and characterize agricultural landscape types is readily available in other countries, our approach could easily be adapted to similar data sources under and a wide variety of landscape types.

AB BackgroundMountain grasslands are globally important ecosystems. They are considered as heritage sites with outstanding values to ecological communities by adding a further layer and support to the existing protection measures. However, mountain grasslands are increasingly under threat from human activities and impacts of climate change.MethodsUsing satellite imagery, we studied land use/land cover (LULC) patterns between 1973 and 2015. Individual interviews consisting of 240 households for comparison and field data collection were conducted for accuracy assessment.ResultsFive categories of LULC types were identified from the image classification that included forestland, grassland, shrubland, bushland, and agricultural land. Between 1973 and 2015, the forestland, grassland, and shrubland covers were declined by 15.9%, 53.6%, and 41.0%, respectively. In contrast, bushland and agricultural land were increased by 169% and 647%, respectively. The overall LULC classification accuracies for the four reference years ranged from 77.6 to 86.5% with Kappa statistic of 0.69 to 0.80. The majority of respondents (92.5%) mentioned that the cover of forestland outsized the other land use land cover types followed by grassland in the past.ConclusionsThe stated indicators of land use/land cover changes linked to the impact of climate change were decline in milk yield and crop production, spread of livestock diseases, degradation of grazing lands, and change in the timing of rain. The results of the study suggest that human-climate related components were major drivers of land use/land cover dynamics that demand for proper management and conservation of mountain grassland ecosystem in Sidama South Ethiopia.

TI Hyperspectral images segmentation: a proposal
SO TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
LA French
DT Article
DE Hyperspectral imaging; segmentation; chemometric
AB Hyper-Spectral Imaging (HIS) also known as chemical or spectroscopic imaging is an emerging technique that combines imaging and spectroscopy to capture both spectral and spatial information from an object. Hyperspectral images are made up of contiguous wavebands in a given spectral band. These images provide information on the chemical make-up profile of objects, thus allowing the differentiation of objects of the same colour but which possess make-up profile. Yet, whatever the application field, most of the methods devoted to HIS processing conduct data analysis without taking into account spatial information. Pixels are processed individually, as an array of spectral data without any spatial structure. Standard classification approaches are thus widely used (k-means, fuzzy-c-means hierarchical classification...). Linear modelling methods such as Partial Least Square analysis (PLS) or non linear approaches like support vector machine (SVM) are also used at different scales (remote sensing or laboratory applications). However, with the development of high resolution sensors, coupled exploitation of spectral and spatial information to process complex images, would appear to be a very relevant approach. However, few methods are proposed in the litterature. The most recent approaches can be broadly classified in two main categories. The first ones are related to a direct extension of individual pixel classification methods using just the spectral dimension (k-means, fuzzy-c-means or FCM, Support Vector Machine or SVM). Spatial dimension is integrated as an additionnal classification parameter (Markov fields with local homogeneity constrainst [5], Support Vector Machine or SVM with spectral and spatial kernels combination [2], geometrically guided fuzzy C-means [3]...). The second ones combine the two fields related to each dimension (spectral and spatial), namely chemometric and image analysis. Various strategies have been attempted. The first one is to rely on chemometrics methods (Principal Component Analysis or PCA, Independant Component Analysis or ICA, Curvilinear Component Analysis...) to reduce the spectral dimension and then to apply standard images processing technics on the resulting score images i.e. data projection on a subspace. Another approach is to extend the definition of basic image processing operators to this new dimensionality (morphological operators for example [1, 4]). However, the approaches mentioned above tend to favour only one description either directly or indirectly (spectral or spatial). The purpose of this paper is to propose a hyperspectral processing approach that strikes a better balance in the treatment of both kinds of information.
   To achieve this, a generic scheme is proposed to associate more closely the spectral and spatial aspects symmetrically and conjunctively. This method, called butterfly, aims to perform an iterative and a cross analysis of data in the spectral and the spatial domains lead to the segmentation of the hyperspectral image. The strategy is based on two steps
   - Extraction of a spatial structure (topology) incorporating a spectral structure,
   - Extraction of a spectral structure (latent variables) incorporating a spatial structure,
   These steps are processed in a successive, iterative and inter-dependent way.
   In this article, we will focus solely on specific notions of topology i.e. the notions of connectivity and adjacency. Thus, the first stage deals with the use of commonly used image processing tools (region segmentation algorithms) on a limited number of score images. This makes it relatively easy to process. To carry out the second step, we use chemometric tools to reveal a subspace (latent variables) enabling the characterization of heterogeneity of the obtained image partitions. However, the scheme can be applied on two different ways depending on the region segmentation strategy used i.e. top down approaches (splitting) or bottom-up approaches (merging). We have implemented this scheme by using a split and merge strategy based on the quadtree approach. Each phase is done over successive steps (iterations). At each iteration of the split phase, the data are projected on k(1) suitable latent variables. The split of each existing region (partition) into four disjoints quadrants is tested and the one maximising the Wilks Lambda parameter is chosen. At each iteration of the merge phase, the data are projected on k(2) suitable latent variables and all the merging of two adjacent regions are tested. The one maximising the Wilks Lambda parameter is chosen.
   Lastly, we tested our approach on a simple synthetic image to show more precisely its characteristics and also on two real images at different scales (in field acquisition on crop, remote sensing image of urban zone). The results obtained on real images underline the benefit of the butterfly approach. However, further work will be undertaken to investigate the influence of various parameters. Moreover, other topology notions and image analysis algorithm could be also investigated.

AB Accurate and up-to-date cropland maps play an important role in the study of food security. Traditional mapping of croplands using medium resolution (10-100m) remote sensing imagery involving a "one-time, one-place" approach requires significant computing and labor resources. Although high mapping accuracies can be achieved using this approach, it is tedious and expensive to collect reference information to train the classifiers at each location and to apply over large areas, such as a continent. Moreover, large area cropland mapping presents additional challenges including a wide range of agricultural management practices, climatic conditions, and crop types. To overcome these challenges, here we report on a generalized image classifier to map cropland extent, which builds a classification model using training data from one location and time period, applied to other times and locations without the need for additional training data. The study was demonstrated across eight agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa using Landsat data acquired between 2009 and 2011. To reduce between-scene variability associated with image availability and cloud cover, input data were reduced to salient temporal statistics derived from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) combined with topographic variables. The generalized classifier was then tested across three levels of generalization: 1. individual - where training data were extracted from and applied to the same Landsat footprint; 2. AEZ where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints within an AEZ and applied to any other Landsat footprint in the same AEZ; and 3. regional where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints in the whole study area and applied to any other Landsat footprint inside the study area. Results showed that the generalized classifier is successful in identifying and mapping croplands with comparable success across all three levels of generalization with minimal cost: average loss in accuracy (as measured by overall accuracy) from the individual level (average overall accuracy of 80 +/- 5%) to regional level (average overall accuracy of 74 +/- 10%) is between 2 and 10% depending on the location. Results also show that generalization is not sensitive to the choice of the classification algorithm the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model performs equally well compared to many popular machine learning algorithms found in the literature. This work suggests the generalization/signature extension framework has a great potential for rapid identification and mapping of croplands with reasonable accuracies over large areas using only easily computed vegetation indices with very little user input and ground information requirement.

TI Deep learning versus Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) in weed mapping

DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION; MAPS
AB Rice is the most important food crop in the world, which is meaningful to ensure the quality and quantity of rice production. During the plantation process, weeds are the key factor to influence the rice yields. In recent years, the chemical control becomes the most widely used means to control the weed infestation because of its advantage in pesticide effects and efficiency. However, excessive use of herbicides has caused negative effects on the rice quality as well as the environment. An accurate weed cover map can provide support information for specific site weed management (SSWM) applications, which may well address the problem of traditional chemical controls. In this work, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was captured on four different dates over two different rice fields. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) and deep learning approaches were applied to the weed mapping task of the UAV imagery. For the OBIA methods, the multiresolution segmentation and an improved k-means method were applied to segment the imagery into different objects; the colour and texture features were extracted and concatenated into a feature vector; back propagation (BP) neural network, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest were used for classification. After careful hyperparameter optimization and model selection, it was proven that the OBIA method achieved the accuracy of 66.6% mean intersection over union (MIU) on the testing set, and the inference speed is 2343.5 ms for an image sample. For the deep learning approach, the fully convolutional network (FCN) was applied for the pixel-wise classification task; transfer learning was used, and four pretrained convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet) were transferred to our dataset via fine-tuning technique. Traditional skip architecture and fully connected conditional random fields (CRF) were used to improve the spatial details of FCN; after that, this work proposed to use a partially connected CRF as post processing, which may significantly accelerate the inference speed of fully connected CRF. Besides one single improvement method, hybrid improvement methods were applied and tested. Experimental results showed that the VGGNet-based FCN achieved the highest accuracy; for the improvement methods, the skip architecture and newly proposed partially connected CRF effectively improved the accuracy, and the hybrid improvement method (skip architecture and partially connected CRF) further improved the performance. The hybrid improvement method achieved 80.2% MIU on the testing set, and the inference speed for an image sample is 326.8 ms. The experimental results of this work demonstrated that the UAV remote-sensing utilizing deep learning method can provide reliable support information for SSWM applications in rice fields.

AB Rice acreage estimation is a key aspect of assessing rice production. A method of estimating rice acreage at the county level is explored, using data from the HJ-1A/B Chinese Environmental Satellite for Hunan Province, which has complex rice cropping patterns. The method combines supervised and unsupervised classification using a mixed-pixel decomposition model. The rice acreage estimation results were validated by interpretation of RapidEye images for early-season rice and ground survey data for medium-season and late-season rice. The results showed a good correlation between the estimates derived from RapidEye and from HJ CCD data for pure rice pixels (R-2 = 0.99, 0.99, and 0.97 for early-, medium-, and late- season rice). The discrepancy was < 10% at the plot level (6.5 x 6.5 km) for early- season rice, while it was 12.20 and 12.36% at the plot level (1 x 1 km) for medium-season and late-season rice. These results suggested that the method proposed in this study is capable of rice acreage estimation at the county level. The method can also be used in mountainous regions and areas of fragmented planting. (c) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is of high importance for city dwellers especially in medium-sized cities in sub-Saharan Africa as it fulfills a wide range of multifunctional urban needs. However, the extent of recent agricultural land use dynamics in sub-Saharan African cities under rapid urbanization so far remains unclear. This study assessed the operationality of a rule-based, hierarchical classification of RapidEye satellite imagery to monitor land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics from 2010 to 2017 with a focus on UPA and its patch sizes on the example of the rapidly growing medium-sized city Nakuru, Kenya. The hierarchical system was able to provide a high-resolution, multitemporal, area-wide data set, and proved beneficial through a high flexibility in considering each class separately. Though the approach offered limitations in distinguishing between agricultural crops, the produced data set gave insights about intense LULC dynamics and high land use pressure indicated, in particular, by an increase of sealed areas by 83%, an ongoing expansion of agricultural land and high variations in the detected classes between the years. In the context of data shortage, the findings contribute to the understanding of urbanization patterns in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

SO REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB A pixel-based spectral matching method using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series from GaoFen-1 (GF-1) Satellite was developed based on spectral similarity value (SSV) and iterative thresholding to map irrigated areas for varying and scattered croplands at high resolution in order to improve understanding of dynamic irrigation pattern. The approach was tested in a typical irrigation district in Northwest China, resulting in 16-m irrigated area maps of the major crops (wheat and maize) for 2015-2018. The results showed an overall accuracy of 92.67% with a Kappa Coefficient of 0.89, producer's accuracy of 97.42%, and user's accuracy of 92.65% for the irrigated area. This method does not require a large number of ground-truth data as training samples, resulting in fast calculation speed, which is different from other supervised classification methods. After obtaining the standard spectrum of the study area, the irrigated areas can be continuously mapped for multi-years. Comparing with the existing global products, these high-resolution maps can depict small and fragmented irrigated croplands effectively with higher accuracy, which benefit local water management, food security analysis, and drought impact assessment, providing the prototype for the regions with fragmented croplands which requires high-resolution products.

AB Chestnuts have been part of the landscape and popular culture of the Canary Islands (Spain) since the sixteenth century. Many crops of this species are in state of abandonment and an updated mapping for its study and evaluation is needed. This work proposes the elaboration of this cartography using two satellite images of very high spatial resolution captured on two different dates and representing well-differentiated phenological states of the chestnut: a WorldView-2 image of March 10th, 2015 and a WorldView-3 image of May 12th, 2015 (without and with leaves respectively). Two study areas were selected within the municipality of La Orotava (Tenerife Island). One of the areas contains chestnut trees dispersed in an agricultural and semi-urban environment and in the other one, the specimens are grouped forming a forest merged with Canarian pines and other species of Monteverde. The Maximum Likelihood (ML), the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification algorithms were applied to the multi-temporal image resulting from the combination of both dates. The results show the benefits of using the multi-temporal image for Pinolere with the ANN algorithm and for Chasna area with ML algorithm, in both cases providing an overall accuracy close to 95%.

AB In-season N management of irrigated corn requires frequent acquisition of plant N estimates to timely assess the onset of crop N deficiency and its spatial variability within a field. This study compared ground-based Exotech and QuickBird satellite multispectral data using the normalized GNDVI to produce N status maps of a study site on three days during the corn vegetative growth period. Scale factors to represent N sufficient and N deficient corn were determined for both systems from relationships between the normalized GNDVI and the NSI. A third classification was required for this study to classify areas that exhibited leaf chlorosis that was not caused by N deficiency, i.e., not N related. N status maps generated from normalized GNDVI values showed similar patterns between the two systems for the three corn growth stages (V10, V12, and V15) investigated. However, the extent of the pattern varied between systems. On 2 July (V10), six of six sample sites were correctly classified using leaf N content to indicate plant N status. On the other two days (7 July and 15 July), four of six sites were. correctly classified. Two not N related areas were classified as N deficient when leaf N content was adequate.

AB The intensification of the Montado mixed ecosystem (agro-silvo-pastoral) is a current endeavor in the context of promoting the sustainability of extensive livestock production in the Mediterranean region. Increased pasture productivity and extensive animal production involves the use of technologies to monitor spatial variability and to implement differentiated management of pasture grazing, fertilization or soil amendment. An intermediate step should lead to the identification and demarcation of areas with similar characteristics (soil and/or crop development), known as homogeneous management zones (HMZ) to implement site-specific management strategies. In this study, soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and altimetry surveys were carried out in six experimental pasture fields with a non-contact electromagnetic induction sensor (EM38) associated with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. These ECa and topographic maps were used in geostatistical analyses for designing and establishing final classification maps with three HMZ (less, intermediate and more potential). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), obtained from a proximal optical sensor, and soil and biomass sampling were used to validate these HMZ. From a practical perspective, these HMZ are the basis for preparation of fertilizer prescription maps and use of variable rate technology (VRT) in a Precision Agriculture project.

AB This research aimed to analyze the possibility to estimate and automatically map large areas of soybean cultivation through the use of MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. Two major techniques were used: GEOgraphic-Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and Data Mining (DM). In order to obtain the images, the segmentation algorithm implemented by Definiens Developer was used. A decision tree (DT) was created from a training set previously prepared. Time-series of images from the MODIS sensor aboard the Terra satellite were acquired in order to represent the wide variation of the vegetation pattern along the soybean crop cycle. The time-series data were used only for the CEI index. Furthermore, to compare the results obtained from GEOBIA, the slicing technique was used at the CEI level. After the training, the DT was applied to the vegetation indices generating the thematic map of the spatial distribution of soybean. In accordance with the error matrix and kappa parameter analysis, tests for statistical significance were created. Results indicate that the classification achieved by Kappa coefficients is 0.76. In short, the obtained results proved that combining vegetation indices and time-series data using GEOBIA return promising results for mapping soybean plantation on a regional scale.

AB The objective of this research was to assess vulnerable soil erosion risk with qualitative approach using GIS in Ankara-Guvenc Basin. The study area is located about 44 km north of Ankara and covers 17.5 km(2). The selected theme layers of this model include topographic factor, soil factors (depth, texture, impermeable horizon) and land use. Slope layer and land use-land cover data were prepared by using DEM and Landsat-TM satellite image. According to land use classification, the most common land use type and land cover are rangeland (50.5%) then, rainfed (36.4%), week forest land (3.2%), irrigated land (0.7%) and other various lands (rock out crop and lake) (9.2%). Each land characteristic is also considered as a thematic layer in geographical information systems (GIS) process. After combination of the layers, soil erosion risk map was produced. The results showed that 44.4% of the study area is at high soil erosion risk, whereas 42% of the study area is insignificantly and slightly susceptible to erosion risk. In addition, it was found that only 12.6% of the total area is moderately susceptible to erosion risk. Furthermore, conservation land management measures were also suggested for moderate, high and very high erosion risk areas in Ankara-Guvenc Basin.

AB In recent years unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a popular and cost-effective technology to capture high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing (RS) images for a wide range of precision agriculture applications, which can help reduce costs and environmental impacts by providing detailed agricultural information to optimize field practices. Furthermore, deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied in agricultural applications such as weed detection, crop pest and disease detection, etc. as an intelligent tool. However, most DL-based methods place high computation, memory and network demands on resources. Cloud computing can increase processing efficiency with high scalability and low cost, but results in high latency and great pressure on the network bandwidth. The emerging of edge intelligence, although still in the early stages, provides a promising solution for artificial intelligence (AI) applications on intelligent edge devices at the edge of the network close to data sources. These devices are with built-in processors enabling onboard analytics or AI (e.g., UAVs and Internet of Things gateways). Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive survey on the latest developments of precision agriculture with UAV RS and edge intelligence is conducted for the first time. The major insights observed are as follows: (a) in terms of UAV systems, small or light, fixed-wing or industrial rotor-wing UAVs are widely used in precision agriculture; (b) sensors on UAVs can provide multi-source datasets, and there are only a few public UAV dataset for intelligent precision agriculture, mainly from RGB sensors and a few from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors; (c) DL-based UAV RS methods can be categorized into classification, object detection and segmentation tasks, and convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network are the mostly common used network architectures; (d) cloud computing is a common solution to UAV RS data processing, while edge computing brings the computing close to data sources; (e) edge intelligence is the convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing, in which model compression especially parameter pruning and quantization is the most important and widely used technique at present, and typical edge resources include central processing units, graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays.

AB Oil palm is the main cash crop grown in Malaysia, and palm oil plays an important role in the world oil market. A number of studies have used multisource remote sensing data to conduct research on oil palms in Malaysia, but there are a lack of long-term oil palm mapping studies, especially when the percentage of oil palm tree cover was higher than other plantations in Malaysia during the period of 2000-2012. To overcome this limitation, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to perform oil palm classification based on Landsat reflectance data. The spatial distribution of oil palms in Malaysia in five periods from 2000 to 2018 was obtained. Then, the planting center of gravity transfer method was applied to analyze the expansion of oil palms in Malaysia from 2000 to 2018 using Landsat data, elevation data, oil palm planting area, crude palm oil price, and other statistical data. Meanwhile, the driving factors affecting the change in oil palm planting area were also analyzed. The results showed that: (1) During 2000-2018, the oil palm planted area in Malaysia increased by 5.06 Mha (million ha), with a growth rate of 83.50%. Specifically, the increased area and growth rate for West Malaysia were 2.05 Mha and 62.05% and for East Malaysia were 3.01 Mha and 109.45%, respectively. (2) Three expansion patterns of oil palms were observed: (i) from a fragmented pattern to a connected area, (ii) expansion along a river, and (iii) from a plain to a gently sloped area. (3) The maximum shift of the center of gravity of the oil palms in West Malaysia was 10 km, while in East Malaysia, it reached 100 km. The East Malaysia oil palm planting potential was greater than that of West Malaysia and showed a trend of shifting from coastal areas to inland areas. (4) Malaysia's oil palms are mainly planted in areas below 100 m above sea level; although a trend of expansion into high altitudes is visible, oil palm plantings extend to areas below 300 m above sea level. (5) Topography, crude palm oil prices, and deforestation are closely related to changes in oil palm planted area.

AB Continuing global population growth requires an increase in food production, but also new strategies to reduce negative effects of intensive land use on the environment. Rice as key staple food for a majority of the human population is of crucial importance for global and particularly Southeast Asian food supply. As food provision is one key ecosystem service (ES), it is important to know which ESs are provided at which places. Therefore, an ES scoring exercise harnessing local experts' knowledge in a 'rapid assessment' was conducted in seven rice cropping regions in Vietnam and the Philippines. The expert-based scoring values were linked in an 'ES-matrix' to the different land use/land cover (LULC) classes abundant in the study areas. The LULC classifications were based on SPOT satellite image interpretation. The matrices were used to compile ES supply maps that give first indications about ES in regions with different intensive agriculture. The outcomes provide a first 'screening' of ES supply related to different LULC types in rice-dominated regions enabling the communication of the relevance of specific ecosystems for local communities and decision makers. Uncertainties inherent in expert- and land cover-based ES assessments are discussed and recommendations for improvements of future studies are given. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Because of its renewed importance in international agendas, food security in subtropical countries has been the object of studies at different scales, although the spatial components of food security are still largely undocumented. Among other aspects, food security can be assessed using a food selfsufficiency index. We propose a spatial representation of this assessment in the densely populated rural area of the Huasteca Poblana, Mexico, where there is a known tendency towards the loss of selfsufficiency of basic grains. The main agricultural systems in this area are the traditional milpa (a multicrop practice with maize as the main basic crop) system, coffee plantations and grazing land for bovine livestock. We estimate a potential additional milpa -based maize production by smallholders identifying the presence of extensive coffee and pasture systems in the production data of the agricultural census. The surface of extensive coffee plantations and pasture land were estimated using the detailed coffee agricultural census data, and a decision tree combining unsupervised and supervised spectral classification techniques of medium scale (Landsat) satellite imagery. We find that 30% of the territory would benefit more than 50% increment in food security and 13% could theoretically become maize self-sufficient from the conversion of extensive systems to the traditional multicrop milpa system.

AB The northern fringe of sub-Saharan Africa is a region that is considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change, and it is a location in which food security remains a major challenge. To address these issues, it is essential to develop global data sets of the geographic distribution of agricultural land use. The objectives of this study were to test an original data mining approach for classifying and mapping the cropped land in West Africa using coarse-resolution imagery and to compare the classification results with those obtained from a classic ISODATA approach. The data mining approach is able to handle large volumes of data and is based on different descriptors (65) of the land use, including the spatial and temporal satellite-derived metrics of 12 MODIS NDVI 16-day composite images and the static attributes taken from field surveys. The classic ISODATA method showed that 68.3% of pixels from a SPOT reference map were correctly classified in three validation sites versus 57.8% for the data mining approach. Validation by field observations showed equivalent results for both methods with an F-score of 0.72. The results of this study demonstrated the relevance of the use of data-mining tools for large-area monitoring.

AB Snow coverage mapping plays a vital role not only in studying hydrology and climatology, but also in investigating crop disease overwintering for smart agriculture management. This work investigates snow coverage mapping by learning from Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral images via machine-learning methods. To this end, the largest dataset for snow coverage mapping (to our best knowledge) with three typical classes (snow, cloud and background) is first collected and labeled via the semi-automatic classification plugin in QGIS. Then, both random forest-based conventional machine learning and U-Net-based deep learning are applied to the semantic segmentation challenge in this work. The effects of various input band combinations are also investigated so that the most suitable one can be identified. Experimental results show that (1) both conventional machine-learning and advanced deep-learning methods significantly outperform the existing rule-based Sen2Cor product for snow mapping; (2) U-Net generally outperforms the random forest since both spectral and spatial information is incorporated in U-Net via convolution operations; (3) the best spectral band combination for U-Net is B2, B11, B4 and B9. It is concluded that a U-Net-based deep-learning classifier with four informative spectral bands is suitable for snow coverage mapping.

AB This paper provides results of an application of a holistic systematic approach of water accounting using remote sensing and GIS coupled with groundwater modeling to evaluate water saving options by tracking non-beneficial evaporation in the Liuyuankou Irrigation System (LIS) of China. Groundwater rise is a major issue in the LIS, where groundwater levels have risen alarmingly close to the ground surface (within 1 m) near the Yellow River. The lumped water balance analysis showed high fallow evaporation losses and which need to be reduced for improving water productivity.
   The seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETs) was estimated by applying the SEBAL algorithm for 18 NOAA AVHRR-12 images over the year of 1990-1991 (April 1990-March 1991). This analysis was aided by the unsupervised land use classification applied to three Landsat 5 TM images of the study area. SEBAL results confirmed that a fair amount (116.7 MCM) of water can be saved by reducing evaporation from fallow land which will result in improved water productivity at the irrigation system. The water accounting indicator (for the analysis period) shows that the process fraction per unit of depleted water (PFdepleted) is 0.52 for LIS, meaning that 52% of the depleted water is consumed by agricultural crops and 48% is lost through non-process depletion.
   Finally, the groundwater modeling was applied to simulate three land use and water management interventions to assess their effectiveness for both water savings and impact on the groundwater in LIS. MODFLOW's Zone Budget code calculates the groundwater budget of user-specified subregions, the exchange of flows between subregions and also calculates a volumetric water budget for the entire model at the end of each time step. The simulation results showed that fallow evaporation could be reduced between 14.2% (25.51 MCM) and 45.3% (81.36 MCM) by interventions such as canal lining and groundwater pumping. The reduction in non-beneficial ET, volumes would mean that more water would be available for other uses and it would allow the introduction of more surface water supplies in the area through improved water management strategies. This will ultimately lead to improved water productivity of the LIS system. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Egypt faces great challenges to manage its limited freshwater resources. Shortage in freshwater, due to expected stresses of climatic changes and upper Nile projects, will have major impacts on Egypt's water and food security. About 85% of the annual total freshwater resource is consumed by agriculture. The objective of this work is to assess the future water security situation of Kafr El-Sheikh governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt, under climate change and urbanization stresses, compared to the current situation. Main investigated water security elements for this study were the irrigation water requirements and agricultural land areas. Two different reference evapotranspiration equations were used to calculate the future irrigation water requirements under three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios) for the period 2010-2100, based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change's 5th assessment report. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used to generate a land use classification map, which was used to estimate the losses in each land use category of the study area under 0.5 and 1.0 m relative sea level rise (SLR) estimates. Combined scenarios of future changes in irrigation water consumption and agricultural land area were analysed. The results show that the future water security situation of the governorate is highly sensitive to projected climatic changes. Moreover, most future scenarios revealed that the agricultural land area would decrease, which will cause serious food security problems. The maximum decrease by about 55.9% of the agricultural land area for year 2095 compared to year 2016 is estimated, due to the current annual decreasing rate of 0.4% and 1.0 m SLR, whatever the applied RCP scenario. While the maximum increase in the required irrigation water would be about 6% due to the RCP85 scenario, assuming no change in the irrigation land area, with a mixing ratio of 1.34 (freshwater): 1 (drainage water) which would affect the crop yield productivity. A regular assessment of water security elements for each of the Egyptian governorates should be managed and an urgent integrated plan for food security to adapt with the future climate change impacts is essential.

AB Net primary production (NPP) is an important indicator of the supply of food and wood. We used a hierarchy model and real time field observations to estimate NPP using satellite imagery. Net radiation received by rice crop canopies was estimated as 27,428 Wm(-2) (215.4 Wm(-2) as averaged) throughout the rice cultivation period (RCP), including 23,168 Wm(-2) (118.3 Wm(-2) as averaged) as shortwave and 4260 Wm(-2) (34.63 Wm(-2) as averaged) as longwave radiation. Soil, sensible and latent heat fluxes were approximated as 3324 Wm(-2), 16,549 Wm(-2), and 7554 Wm(-2), respectively. Water stress on rice crops varied between 0.5838 and 0.1218 from the start until the end of the RCP. Biomass generation declined from 6.09-1.03 g/m(2) in the tillering and ripening stages, respectively. We added a soil suitability constant () into the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to achieve a more precise estimate of yield. Classification results suggest that the total area under rice cultivation was 8861 km(2). The spatial distribution of rice cultivation as per suitability zone was: 1674 km(2) was not suitable (NS), 592 km(2) was less suitable (LS), 2210 km(2) was moderately suitable (MS) and 4385 km(2) was highly suitable (HS) soil type with ranges of 0.05-0.25, 0.4-0.6, 0.7-0.75 and 0.85-0.95 of the CASA based yield, respectively. We estimated net production as 1.63 million tons, as per 0.46 ton/ha, 1.2 ton/ha 1.9 ton/ha and 2.4 ton/ha from NS, LS, MS and HS soil types, respectively. The results obtained through this improved CASA model, by addition of the constant , are likely to be useful for agronomists by providing more accurate estimates of NPP.

AB The relationships between historical land use transformations and spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation and temperature over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) were examined based on Landsat satellite observations for the years 1986, 1995, and 2000 and regional climate model simulations in the period 1991-2000. The satellite-derived land use/cover classification shows increased conversion of large portions of forests over the GHA to agriculture, particularly in Kenya, with land (acreage) under crops increasing from 6.55% in 1986 to almost 18% by the year 2000. Sensitivity experiments performed with regional climate model, Version 4 (RegCM4), indicate that expanding agriculture into forested areas led to a modest reduction in monthly rainfall totals and also may be contributing to notable shifts in moisture convergence zones and centers of rainfall maxima. Student's t-test at a 0.1 significant level showed a decrease in precipitation and an increase in surface temperature around the lake region when surface vegetation cover is converted to agricultural land cover type. Conversely, under the assumption that large sections of croplands are converted to forest, the simulations resulted in a modest increase in precipitation and a reduction of surface temperature around the lake region, changes that are significant at the 0.1 confidence level. A substantial trade-off in the components of the surface energy balance between sensible heat flux (SHF) and latent heat flux (LHF) was observed for the different conversion types. Under the assumption of reforestation, both SHF and LHF increased. The increase in SHF was almost twice that of LHF. On the other hand, when land cover types were converted to agricultural types, SHF decreased, while LHF did not show any significant change.

AB India has experienced significant Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LULCC) over the past few decades. In this context, careful observation and mapping of LULCC using satellite data of high to medium spatial resolution is crucial for understanding the long-term usage patterns of natural resources and facilitating sustainable management to plan, monitor and evaluate development. The present study utilizes the satellite images to generate national level LULC maps at decadal intervals for 1985, 1995 and 2005 using onscreen visual interpretation techniques with minimum mapping unit of 2.5 hectares. These maps follow the classification scheme of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) to ensure compatibility with other global/regional LULC datasets for comparison and integration. Our LULC maps with more than 90% overall accuracy highlight the changes prominent at regional level, i.e., loss of forest cover in central and northeast India, increase of cropland area in Western India, growth of peri-urban area, and relative increase in plantations. We also found spatial correlation between the cropping area and precipitation, which in turn confirms the monsoon dependent agriculture system in the country. On comparison with the existing global LULC products (GlobCover and MODIS), it can be concluded that our dataset has captured the maximum cumulative patch diversity frequency indicating the detailed representation that can be attributed to the on-screen visual interpretation technique. Comparisons with global LULC products (GlobCover and MODIS) show that our dataset captures maximum landscape diversity, which is partly attributable to the on-screen visual interpretation techniques. We advocate the utility of this database for national and regional studies on land dynamics and climate change research. The database would be updated to 2015 as a continuing effort of this study.

DT Article
DE Kiziltepe; MODIS NDVI; Change in vegetation; Remote sensing; GIS
AB In this study, MODIS NDVI data with 16-day temporal and 250-m spatial resolution, computed using red and near-infrared band are used. Two classes, namely agricultural lands with high biomass activity and non-agricultural lands (bare areas, water mask and damaged fields) using ISODATA method in unsupervised classification based on the GIS are defined. The methods and data used in this study are commonly used in scholarly works abroad and in the analyses of drought. However, their usage by Turkish institutions and organizations is almost non existent. Therefore, this study tests both the promotion of these images' areas of usage and their reliability. Kiziltepe district of Mardin city is chosen as the field of study in order to test the satellite images. As an important plain in Turkey and having seen a rapid agricultural change after the 1990s, Kiziltepe has shifted to the system of double cropping in the same year together with the irrigated agriculture. Maize and wheat sowing gain intensity at the end of June and beginning of July after the harvesting of winter wheat. Thus, the MODIS NDVI satellite images used in this study clearly reflects the change of agricultural structure in Kiziltepe. Considering the results obtained from these images, agricultural lands with high biomass activity which was about 41,000 hectares in August 2001 have risen up to 72,000 hectares in 2006 in parallel to the proliferation of irrigated agriculture and up to 83,000 hectares in 2011. But the agricultural lands with high biomass activity are about 2,000 ha in 2001, 3,200 ha in 2006 and only 760 ha when the wheat harvesting is completed in June in these years respectively.

AB Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced substantial urbanisation and land degradation processes over the past three decades. Using multi-source satellite imagery combined with geographical and demographic data, this study's aims were to analyse the extent of land cover changes (LCC) and identifying major landscape transformation processes (LIP) and their drivers for four West African cities in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Nigeria and Niger. A common classification scheme was used for a visual interpretation of Corona images from the 1960s and an automated classification of Landsat scenes from 1986, 2000/2001 and 2009. Based on a postclassification comparison LCC were summarized and related to the demographic trends of the past 50 years. Map changes were calculated from 1986 to 2009 to depict LIP (urbanisation, crop expansion, deforestation, and land abandonment) for the cities and their respective hinterlands. To investigate the effect of accessibility and infrastructural factors. LIP were related to the distance to roads, surface water and urban areas. From 1960 to 2009 a large-scale urban agglomeration was detected and the proportion of cultivated land in former natural woody savannas surrounding all four cities increased by 35%. The expansion of cropland during the past 30 years seemed to depend greatly on the availability of irrigation water in the semi-arid Sahelian cities (Kano and Niamey), whilst this was not a major driving factor for the cities of the Sudanian zone (Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso). Given the likely increase in water scarcity and land suitable for agriculture, ex ante land use planning and monitoring strategies will become increasingly important. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The lack of sufficient ground truth data has always constrained supervised learning, thereby hindering the generation of up-to-date satellite-derived thematic maps. This is all the more true for those applications requiring frequent updates over large areas such as cropland mapping. Therefore, we present a method enabling the automated production of spatially consistent cropland maps at the national scale, based on spectral-temporal features and outdated land cover information. Following an unsupervised approach, this method extracts reliable calibration pixels based on their labels in the outdated map and their spectral signatures. To ensure spatial consistency and coherence in the map, we first propose to generate seamless input images by normalizing the time series and deriving spectral-temporal features that target salient cropland characteristics. Second, we reduce the spatial variability of the class signatures by stratifying the country and by classifying each stratum independently. Finally, we remove speckle with a weighted majority filter accounting for per-pixel classification confidence. Capitalizing on a wall-to-wall validation data set, the method was tested in South Africa using a 16-year old land cover map and multi-sensor Landsat time series. The overall accuracy of the resulting cropland map reached 92%. A spatially explicit validation revealed large variations across the country and suggests that intensive grain-growing areas were better characterized than smallholder farming systems. Informative features in the classification process vary from one stratum to another but features targeting the minimum of vegetation as well as short-wave infrared features were consistently important throughout the country. Overall, the approach showed potential for routinely delivering consistent cropland maps over large areas as required for operational crop monitoring.

AB Reliable and high-resolution subsurface characterization beyond the field scale is of great interest for precision agriculture and agro-ecological modelling because the shallow soil (similar to 1-2 m depth) is responsible for the storage of moisture and nutrients that are accessible to crops. This can potentially be achieved with a combination of direct sampling and Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) measurements, which have shown great potential for soil characterization due to their non-invasive nature and high mobility. However, only a few studies have used EMI beyond the field scale because of the challenges associated with a consistent interpretation of EMI data from multiple fields and acquisition days. In this study, we performed a detailed EMI survey of an area of 1 km(2) divided in 51 agricultural fields where previous studies showed a clear connection between crop performance and soil properties. In total, nine apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values were measured at each location with a depth of investigation ranging between 0-0.2 to 0-2.7 m. Based on the combination of ECa maps and available soil maps, an a priori interpretation was performed and four sub-areas with characteristic sediments and ECa were identified. Then, a supervised classification methodology was used to divide the ECa maps into areas with similar soil properties. In a next step, soil profile descriptions to a depth of 2 m were obtained at 100 sampling locations and 552 samples were analyzed for textural characteristics. The combination of the classified map and ground truth data resulted in a 1 m resolution soil map with eighteen units with a typical soil profile and texture information. It was found that the soil profile descriptions and texture of the EMI-based soil classes were significantly different when compared using a two-tailed t-test. Moreover, the high-resolution soil map corresponded well with patterns in crop health obtained from satellite imagery. It was concluded that this novel EMI data processing approach provides a reliable and cost-effective tool to obtain high-resolution soil maps to support precision agriculture and agro-ecological modelling.

AB Across Southeastern China, the expansion of citrus plantation has underpinned substantial economic development at the expense of forest cover and associated ecosystem services. The high-order complexity of citrus planting dynamics requires more detailed observations. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel monitoring scheme by integrating multi-epoch land cover classification and continuous change detection on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using all available Landsat archives (1986-2018). First, a stable/changed area masking approach was adopted. Then, the GEE-based Continuous Change Detection and Classification (GEE-CCDC) algorithm was applied to detect the timing and position of citrus planting-related land cover changes. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme was validated both spatially and temporally. We applied the proposed scheme in Xunwu, a typical County in Southeastern China where continuous expansion was disrupted by an outbreak of Huanglongbing (HLB, a destructive citrus disease). The validation results indicate that the multiepoch classification effectively identified the stable, abandoned, and newly cultivated areas related to citrus planting. Within these areas, our monitoring of citrus planting dynamics had an overall temporal accuracy of 90.59% and a mean detection date deviation of 13.21 days (leading). Based on the change detection results, we found a two-stage change pattern, namely a continuous expansion period (1986-2016) followed by a disturbance period (2017-2018). Moreover, almost half of the orchards were cultivated in regions with an elevation and slope of 301-400 m and 11-20 degrees. During the continuous expansion period, a total of 497.85 km(2) natural lands were converted for citrus planting. Affected by the HLB outbreak, both orchard abandonment (114.66 km(2)) and new orchard cultivation (36.87 km(2)) were detected during the disturbance period. The proposed scheme offers a useful tool for cash crops management, and highlights the value of dense satellite data in monitoring the extent of ongoing human appropriation of natural ecosystems at a large scale and long-term.

AB The fusion of hyperspectral (HS) and multispectral (MS) images with complementary high spectral and high spatial resolution information has been successfully applied to improve the low spatial resolution limitation of current satellite sensors with high spectral resolution. Fusion methods based on spectral unmixing have led to state-of-the-art results with the advantage of obtaining pure spectral signatures and their proportion in the image of analysis as a result of the fusion process. However, pure spectral signatures observed in HS images are affected by variations in atmospheric, environmental and illumination conditions which are significant sources of errors in HS image analysis. Conventional unmixing-based fusion methods neglect the spectral variability of HS images introducing and propagating errors through the fusion process, affecting further inference tasks such as classification, target detection, and change detection. Therefore, this paper proposes HS-MS image fusion algorithm based on spectral unmixing accounting for spectral variability through an augmented linear mixing model (ALMM). An alternating optimization strategy is combined with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently minimize the underlying cost function of the fusion problem. Simulation results on realistic data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in different metrics. Additionally, the fusion of crop images acquired with DESIS and Sentinel-2 sensors in a region of Colombia confirms the advantages of the proposed fusion method.

AB Homegrown fruits and vegetables are gaining popularity in many metropolitan areas with several facets connected to the wider urban agriculture phenomenon. At the same time, the relationship between urban food production and irrigation water is pivotal in terms of resource management. In this paper, we investigated water savings through the collection and use of harvestable rainwater from buildings' rooftops to irrigate 2631 fruits and vegetables gardens in the urban area of Rome (Italy). The methodology makes use of existing geospatial data and data derived from satellite image classification to estimate food gardens' irrigation requirements and harvestable rainwater from nearby buildings' rooftops. The comparison of the annual harvestable rainwater with irrigation needs allowed for computing the proportion of water self-sufficient gardens as well as the amount of gardens whose water needs might be partially fulfilled with rainwater. Statistics were produced by land use type (horticulture, mixed crops, olive groves, orchards, and vineyards) and under the hypothesis that irrigation systems with low and high field application efficiency might be employed. We found that 19% and 33% of the gardens could be water self-sufficient for the low and high irrigation efficiency scenario, respectively. The remaining gardens, by using the available rainwater, could satisfy 22% (low efficiency) and 44% (high efficiency) of the water needs resulting in a reduction in the use of conventional water sources.

AB Phenology-based rice mapping has mostly employed all satellite data over the growing season. This approach is not only time consuming but also requires huge data storage and is thus unsuitable for operational initiatives. Even with the use of feature selection algorithms that minimise data redundancy, the huge amount of time in data processing prior to optimal image subset selection is unavoidable. Thus, this study seeks to identify the rice development phase(s) whose Sentinel-1A data in vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) and vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) polarizations offer the most accurate rice field discrimination. Using an area in southeast China during the 2017 growing season, VH + VV data of the vegetative and maturity phases recorded the highest overall accuracy (89.3%) based on Random Forest (RF). For the agro-ecology investigated in this study, therefore, potential users of Sentinel-1A in rice mapping can ex-ante select images acquired over the crop's vegetative and maturity phases to avoid the enormous computational time and storage attendant with entire-season data. These findings would complement algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) that lack feature section tools. However, replications of this study at multiple years and ecologies, and comparison with classifications obtained from optimal data selection tools (variable importance) are strongly recommended to arrive at universally applicable conclusions.

AB The upstream Dong Nai River Basin is located in the country's key economic development region and its water resources are a key component of sustainable regional development. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of land use and land cover changes (LULCC) on the flow regime in this tropical forest basin using a flow-duration curve analysis that has been widely used in Japan. This study combined two different temporal and spatial scales of satellite data, Landsat and Global Inventory Modeling, and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to analyze LUCC. Results from the land cover classification of five Landsat images between 1973 and 2014 indicated that the forest area decreased significantly in the period of 1994 to 2005 due to population growth, leading to land conversion for agriculture. Furthermore, secular changes in the annual GIMMS-NDVI data revealed that land cover changes occurred from 1996 and a large amount of forest was lost in 1999; however, due to the rapid regrowth of secondary forest of tropical forests and the development of the crop, the vegetation recovered shortly afterwards in 2000 before decreasing again after 2004. Following large-scale deforestation, the total discharge, maximum flow, and the plentiful, ordinary, low, and small-scale runoff increased sharply and decreased thereafter because of vegetation regrowth.

AB Flood mapping, particularly hazard and risk mapping, is an imperative process and a fundamental part of emergency response and risk management. This paper aims to produce a flood risk proxy map of damaged rice fields over the whole of Bangladesh, where monsoon river floods are dominant and frequent, affecting over 80% of the total population. This proxy risk map was developed to meet the request of the government on a national level. This study represents a rapid, straightforward methodology for estimating rice-crop damage in flood areas of Bangladesh during the large flood from July to September 2007, despite the lack of primary data. We improved a water detection algorithm to achieve a better discrimination capacity to discern flood areas by using a modified land surface water index (MLSWI). Then, rice fields were estimated utilizing a hybrid rice field map from land-cover classification and MODIS-derived indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The results showed that the developed method is capable of providing instant, comprehensive, nationwide mapping of flood risks, such as rice field damage. The detected flood areas and damaged rice fields during the 2007 flood were verified by comparing them with the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 images (a 10 m spatial resolution) and in situ field survey data with moderate agreement (K = 0.57).

AB Accurate change detection of cropland area and their spatial distributions are important for cropland monitoring, food security, and sustainable development. Tea as a strategic crop in northern Iran, has faced many challenges in the coming decades which has led to a decrease in its area under cultivation. The present study aims to identify changes in tea land area located in central district of Lahijan, Gilan, Iran by using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images. First, pre-processing stage was performed on satellite images including atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections. The supervized neural network classification method was employed, resulting in three classification maps with overall accuracies of 94.82, 95.36 and 97.84% and kappa coefficients of 96.22, 97.91, and 98.42 for 1999, 2011, and 2019, respectively which these were satisfactory. The images were categorized into four different classes, namely tea land, agriculture, forest and urban area. The results of Land Change Modeler showed that during 1999-2019, tea and agricultural lands decreased by 23.46% (2142 ha) and 41.71% (3872 ha). The loss trend of tea area in 1999-2011 has been more remarkable with a decrease of 1943 ha (21.28%). This downward trend continued with a slower slope (2.77% equal to 199 ha). Urbanization with growth rate of 381.71% consumed 2096 ha of tea land. Further, forestland contributed 251 ha to tea land losses. Reversely, the contribution of agricultural land to net change of tea area were positive so that 403 ha in 1999-2011 and 74 ha in 2011-2019 from cropland were converted to tea land. The paper highlights the advantage of digital change detection techniques for policy makers to take appropriate decision to return the situation and to conserve the productive agricultural lands.

AB Applying numerous features is common for complex land cover classification which makes feature selection necessary. Although the selected feature subsets may yield high overall accuracies in the case of spectrally similar classes such as wetlands, several individual accuracies are often low. A reason is that one set of features used to separate one specific class from the rest might not be appropriate for delineating another class. An additional reason is that while the overall accuracy is applied to evaluate the potential of a feature subset, it may be influenced by a few high-accuracy classes that are spectrally distinct and for which collecting enough training data is feasible. In this article, rather than simultaneously mapping all classes, they were individually classified using a different feature selection. Spectral analysis was applied to determine both the order of the classes to be mapped and a merging scheme that was applied to the remaining classes to increase the accuracy of the target class. The proposed approach was applied to wetland mapping using five pilot sites throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The dataset available for each pilot site differed in quality and quantity. However, the proposed method accurately classified wetlands in all pilot sites, even those with limited satellite and/or field data, and outperformed the classic method by increasing the average producer and user accuracies of wetlands by up to 22% and 25%, respectively, and yielding overall accuracies up to 93%. Among wetland classes, Shallow Water was easier to be distinguished, as a result of being spectrally less similar to the rest of the wetland classes. Based on the obtained results, the proposed method can be effectively applied for classifications involving spectrally similar classes, including sea ice and crop mapping.

AB Nowadays it is known how to resolve many questions through satellite imagery such as Landsat 8 and the like, both from the theoretical point of view, i.e. research, as well as from the practical standpoint, e.g. commercial applications. This study evaluated the possibility of generalizing the training for supervised classification of multispectral images with sub-centimeter resolution. Images were taken under uncontrolled conditions of lighting and sun-target-sensor geometry and in the presence of normal interference in the agricultural environment. The images were obtained by the DuncanTech MS3100 camera (Auburn, CA, USA), a multispectral camera (green, red and near infra-red) mounted on a mobile ground platform and transformed into reflectance. For each element present (leaves, stems, spikes, soil, shadows, spectral references and sampling implements), a representative area was delimited in each image. These regions of interest were used, first, to quantify the separability of the classes. The next step was to define groups for cross-validation within these regions of interest; ten-folds were defined randomly with the constraint of a uniform distribution of classes. These folds were used in training and evaluation of the supervised classification using spectral angle mapper, maximum likelihood and decision trees. Spectral angle mapper correctly classified 49.2 % of cases, the maximum likelihood achieved a success rate of 86.8 % and the decision tree correctly classified 99.5 % of the spectral signatures. These results prove that multispectral images taken under uncontrolled conditions can be successfully classified by a generalized model that takes advantage of the higher spatial resolution. This opens a new line in which those pixels that do not correspond to vegetation, which bias the estimates of the crop parameters and complicate the recognition of objects, could be automatically masked.

AB BackgroundField phenotyping by remote sensing has received increased interest in recent years with the possibility of achieving high-throughput analysis of crop fields. Along with the various technological developments, the application of machine learning methods for image analysis has enhanced the potential for quantitative assessment of a multitude of crop traits. For wheat breeding purposes, assessing the production of wheat spikes, as the grain-bearing organ, is a useful proxy measure of grain production. Thus, being able to detect and characterize spikes from images of wheat fields is an essential component in a wheat breeding pipeline for the selection of high yielding varieties. ResultsWe have applied a deep learning approach to accurately detect, count and analyze wheat spikes for yield estimation. We have tested the approach on a set of images of wheat field trial comprising 10 varieties subjected to three fertilizer treatments. The images have been captured over one season, using high definition RGB cameras mounted on a land-based imaging platform, and viewing the wheat plots from an oblique angle. A subset of in-field images has been accurately labeled by manually annotating all the spike regions. This annotated dataset, called SPIKE, is then used to train four region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) which take, as input, images of wheat plots, and accurately detect and count spike regions in each plot. The CNNs also output the spike density and a classification probability for each plot. Using the same R-CNN architecture, four different models were generated based on four different datasets of training and testing images captured at various growth stages. Despite the challenging field imaging conditions, e.g., variable illumination conditions, high spike occlusion, and complex background, the four R-CNN models achieve an average detection accuracy ranging from 88 to 94% across different sets of test images. The most robust R-CNN model, which achieved the highest accuracy, is then selected to study the variation in spike production over 10 wheat varieties and three treatments. The SPIKE dataset and the trained CNN are the main contributions of this paper. ConclusionWith the availability of good training datasets such us the SPIKE dataset proposed in this article, deep learning techniques can achieve high accuracy in detecting and counting spikes from complex wheat field images. The proposed robust R-CNN model, which has been trained on spike images captured during different growth stages, is optimized for application to a wider variety of field scenarios. It accurately quantifies the differences in yield produced by the 10 varieties we have studied, and their respective responses to fertilizer treatment. We have also observed that the other R-CNN models exhibit more specialized performances. The data set and the R-CNN model, which we make publicly available, have the potential to greatly benefit plant breeders by facilitating the high throughput selection of high yielding varieties.

   remote sensing; Drought indices
ID VEGETATION INDEXES
AB Beginning with a discussion of drought definitions, this review paper attempts to provide a review of fundamental concepts of drought, classification of droughts, drought indices, and the role of remote sensing and geographic information systems for drought evaluation. Owing to the rise in water demand and looming climate change, recent years have witnessed much focus on global drought scenarios. As a natural hazard, drought is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. An understanding of the relationships between these two sets of parameters is necessary to develop measures for mitigating the impacts of droughts. Droughts are recognized as an environmental disaster and have attracted the attention of environmentalists, ecologists, hydrologists, meteorologists, geologists, and agricultural scientists. Temperatures; high winds; low relative humidity; and timing and characteristics of rains, including distribution of rainy days during crop growing seasons, intensity, and duration of rain, and onset and termination, play a significant role in the occurrence of droughts. In contrast to aridity, which is a permanent feature of climate and is restricted to low rainfall areas, a drought is a temporary aberration. Often, there is confusion between a heat wave and a drought, and the distinction is emphasized between heat wave and drought, noting that a typical time scale associated with a heat wave is on the order of a week, while a drought may persist for months or even years. The combination of a heat wave and a drought has dire socio-economic consequences. Drought risk is a product of a region's exposure to the natural hazard and its vulnerability to extended periods of water shortage. If nations and regions are to make progress in reducing the serious consequences of drought, they must improve their understanding of the hazard and the factors that influence vulnerability. It is critical for drought-prone regions to better understand their drought climatology (i.e., the probability of drought at different levels of intensity and duration) and establish comprehensive and integrated drought information system that incorporates climate, soil, and water supply factors such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snow pack, reservoir and lake levels, ground water levels, and stream flow. All drought-prone nations should develop national drought policies and preparedness plans that place emphasis on risk management rather than following the traditional approach of crisis management, where the emphasis is on reactive, emergency response measures. Crisis management decreases self-reliance and increases dependence on government and donors.

AB Winter wheat is one of the major cereal crops in China. The spatial distribution of winter wheat planting areas is closely related to food security; however, mapping winter wheat with time-series finer spatial resolution satellite images across large areas is challenging. This paper explores the potential of combining temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data available via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for mapping winter wheat in Shandong Province, China. First, six phenological median composites of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance measures were generated by a temporal aggregation technique according to the winter wheat phenological calendar, which covered seedling, tillering, over-wintering, reviving, jointing-heading and maturing phases, respectively. Then, Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to classify multi-temporal composites but also mono-temporal winter wheat development phases and mono-sensor data. The results showed that winter wheat could be classified with an overall accuracy of 93.4% and F1 measure (the harmonic mean of producer's and user's accuracy) of 0.97 with temporally aggregated Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data were combined. As our results also revealed, it was always good to classify multi-temporal images compared to mono-temporal imagery (the overall accuracy dropped from 93.4% to as low as 76.4%). It was also good to classify Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery combined instead of classifying them individually. The analysis showed among the mono-temporal winter wheat development phases that the maturing phase's and reviving phase's data were more important than the data for other mono-temporal winter wheat development phases. In sum, this study confirmed the importance of using temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data combined and identified key winter wheat development phases for accurate winter wheat classification. These results can be useful to benefit on freely available optical satellite data (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) and prioritize key winter wheat development phases for accurate mapping winter wheat planting areas across China and elsewhere.

AB The effluent water brought by RBOD (Right Bank Outfall Drain) is not only threat to the aquatic life of Manchar Lake but also the fertile agricultural lands which are being cultivated by use of lake water through Danastar Wah are at risk of salinization. The farming community of the area is scary of continual use of irrigation waters received through the Danastar Wah; they are of the view that the constant use of this water will ruin their fertile lands into salt-affected soils. Thus, keeping in view the fears of the farmers of the command area of Danastar Wah, a study was carried out to investigate the water quality of the Manchar Lake, RBOD MNV (Main Nara Valley) drain and Danastar Wah, and to examine soil salinity status of the area using Geo-referenced field and satellite imagery data for Kharif season of the year 2015. The results of the study showed that the EC (Electrical Conductivity) of the Danastar Wah water was below 1.2 dS/m. Thus, the water was suitable for irrigation purpose. In all the water samples, Na+, Ca2+ + Mg2+ and CO3 concentrations were found within the permissible limits, while no concentration of HCO3 was found in any of the water samples. In the command area, clay texture was dominant down to a depth of 60 cm soil profile. In the area about 37, 28, and 30% of the soils were normal (non-saline), saline and sodic, respectively; while only 5% of soils were saline-sodic. The cotton crop was identified as the major Kharif crop, occupying about 13.76% (2,844 ha) of the total command area, followed by rice crop grown on about 5.21% (1,078 ha) of the command area. The overall accuracy of image classification was 90% with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Based on this study, it can be concluded that the water of the Danastar Wah can be used for irrigation purpose during Kharif season only with the condition that adequate land drainage is maintained. It is also suggested that before using the water of Manchar Lake, RBOD and Danastar Wah for Rabi season, analysis for water quality be conducted. Geo-Informatics (GIS and RS) tools can be employed for spatial and temporal monitoring of water quality of the Manchar Lake.

AB The Asian Migratory locust (Locusta migratoria migratoria L.) is a pest that continuously threatens crops in the Amudarya River delta near the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan, Central Asia. Its development coincides with the growing period of its main food plant, a tall reed grass (Phragmites australis), which represents the predominant vegetation in the delta and which cover vast areas of the former Aral Sea, which is desiccating since the 1960s. Current locust survey methods and control practices would tremendously benefit from accurate and timely spatially explicit information on the potential locust habitat distribution. To that aim, satellite observation from the MODIS Terra/Aqua satellites and in-situ observations were combined to monitor potential locust habitats according to their corresponding risk of infestations along the growing season. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm was applied for classifying time series of MODIS enhanced, vegetation index (EVI) from 2003 to 2014 at an 8-day interval. Based on an independent ground truth data set, classification accuracies of reeds posing a medium or high risk of locust infestation exceeded 89% on average. For the 12-year period covered in this study, an average of 7504 km(2) (28% of the observed area) was flagged as potential locust habitat and 5% represents a permanent high risk of locust infestation. Results are instrumental for predicting potential locust outbreaks and developing well-targeted management plans. The method offers positive perspectives for locust management and treatment of infested sites because it is able to deliver risk maps in near real time, with an accuracy of 80% in April-May which coincides with both locust hatching and the first control surveys. Such maps could help in rapid decision-making regarding control interventions against the initial locust congregations, and thus the efficiency of survey teams and the chemical treatments could be increased, thus potentially reducing environmental pollution while avoiding areas where treatments are most likely to cause environmental degradation.

DE PERSIANN-CCS; Remotely sensed estimated precipitation; southeast of
   Spain; Extreme meteorological phenomena
AB The real time monitoring of storms is important for the management and prevention of flood risks. However, in the southeast of Spain, it seems that the density of the rain gauge network may not be sufficient to adequately characterize the rainfall spatial distribution or the high rainfall intensities that are reached during storms. Satellite precipitation products such as PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks- Cloud Classification System) could be used to complement the automatic rain gauge networks and so help solve this problem. However, the PERSIANN-CCS product has only recently become available, so its operational validity for areas such as south-eastern Spain is not yet known. In this work, a methodology for the hourly validation of PERSIANN-CCS is presented. We used the rain gauge stations of the SIAM (Sistema de Information Agraria de Murcia) network to study three storms with a very high return period. These storms hit the east and southeast of the Iberian Peninsula and resulted in the loss of human life, major damage to agricultural crops and a strong impact on many different types of infrastructure. The study area is the province of Murcia (Region of Murcia), located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, covering an area of more than 11,000 km2 and with a population of almost 1.5 million. In order to validate the PERSIANN-CCS product for these three storms, contrasts were made with the hyetographs registered by the automatic rain gauges, analyzing statistics such as bias, mean square difference and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Although in some cases the temporal distribution of rainfall was well captured by PERSIANN-CCS, in several rain gauges high intensities were not properly represented. The differences were strongly correlated with the rain gauge precipitation, but not with satellite-obtained rainfall. The main conclusion concerns the need for specific local calibration for the study area if PERSIANN-CCS is to be used as an operational tool for the monitoring of extreme meteorological phenomena.

AB Based on the agricultural geophysical classification and the land use and land cover (LULC) type map, the satellite data of multi-time, multi-spatial and multi-spectrum was used to identify the irrigation areas and their geographical locations of crops, plantations and pasture when the up-coming South-to-North Water Transfer Engineering (SNWTE) is completed by 2030. The thermal-dynamics of the soil in the irrigated area was figured out depending not only on the satellite data deduction, but also on the on-site field measurements, the data of the nearby agro-meteorologiclal and/or hydrological stations, which was used to calculate the variation regularity of soil moisture, soil temperature, albedo etc during each irrigation procedure. With reference of the methodology of pseudo-hydrodynamics in agro-hydrology, a new model module was designed to calculate the exchange and transfer process of water and heat energy in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) under the condition of irrigation, which was coupled with the regional climate model RegCM3 and make it to include the irrigation effect.
   The new climate model was then used to simulate the will-be regional climate change in north China as if SNWTE is completed. The preliminary simulation results show that: The large-scale agriculture irrigation might cause significant regional climate change not only in Northern China where the irrigation is implemented, but in the whole numerical domain as well. During the most possible irrigation time of summer months from June to August, the ground temperature, sensible heat flux in the boundary layer decreased within irrigated region and the adjacent areas; while the low-level air humidity, latent heat flux, and precipitation are all increased.
   Large-scale agricultural irrigation not only changes the water vapor factors such as soil moisture and air humidity, but also the thermal factors such as temperature and sensible heat flux and the dynamic factors of potential height and wind field in the atmosphere, which cause regional climate change in the whole numerical domain.

AB Water scarcity and suitable irrigation water management in arid regions represent tangible challenges for sustainable agriculture. The current study aimed to apply multivariate analysis and to develop a simplified water quality assessment using principal component analysis (PCA) and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) technique to assess the water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The proposed methods depended on the monitored water chemical composition (e.g., pH, water electrical conductivity (ECiw), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-) during 2019. Based on the supervised classification of satellite images (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the distinguished land use/land cover types around the Bahr Mouise canal were agriculture, urban, and water bodies, while the dominating land use was agriculture. The water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal was classified into two classes based on the application of the irrigation water quality index (IWQI), while the water quality was classified into three classes using the PCA and AHC methods. Temporal variations in water quality were investigated, where the water qualities in winter, autumn, and spring (January, February, March, April, November, and December) were classified as class I (no restrictions) based on IWQI application, and the water salinity, sodicity, and/or alkalinity did not represent limiting factors for irrigation water quality. On the other hand, in the summer season (May, June, July, August, and October), the irrigation water was classified as class II (low restrictions); therefore, irrigation processes during summer may lead to an increase in the alkalinity hazard. The PCA classifications were compared with the IWQI results; the PCA classifications had similar assessment results during the year, except in September, while the water quality was assigned to class II using the PCA method and class I by applying the IWQI. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) around the Bahr Mouise canal over eight months and climatic data assisted in explaining the fluctuations in water quality during 2019 as a result of changing the crop season and agriculture management. Assessments of water quality help to conserve soil, reduce degradation risk, and support decision makers in order to obtain sustainable agriculture, especially under water irrigation scarcity and the limited agricultural land in such an arid region.

AB Wheat is a staple food of Pakistan's population of more than 180 million. The average annual harvest of 24 million tonnes places Pakistan eighth in the world in wheat production. Roughly, 76% of wheat is produced by Punjab province, the breadbasket of Pakistan. The current wheat area and yield reporting system operated by the Punjab Crop Reporting Service (CRS) delivers estimates several months after harvest. The delayed production data cannot contribute to in-season decision support system, such as timely production estimation. However, freely available satellite imagery at medium spatial resolution offers a data source for addressing this limitation. Using Landsat data from the 2013 to 2014 winter wheat growing season and a supervised bagged classification tree approach, we estimated the area of wheat cultivated in Punjab. Validation consisted of a two-stage probability-based cluster field sample. Field data from 110 sample points distributed among twelve 20 km x 20 km blocks were collected. Overall accuracy of the Landsat-based wheat map was 76% with wheat commission error of 38% and wheat omission error of 30%. The Landsat-based map totalled 6.13 Mha of wheat area, and the field-based sample estimate 6.96 +/- 2.15 Mha. Both figures are comparable to the official Punjab CRS figure of 6.77 Mha. The study presents a robust approach for early wheat area estimation providing information relevant to decision support systems concerning food production and trade.

AB Latin America in general and the Rio de la Plata Grasslands (RPG) in particular, are one of the regions in the world with the highest rates of change in land use/land cover (LULC) in recent times. Despite the magnitude of this change process, LULC descriptions in the RPG are far from being complete, even more those that evaluate LULC change through time. In this work we described LULC and its changes over time for the first 14 years of the 21st century and for the entire grassland biome of the Rio de la Plata, one of the most extensive grassland regions in the world. We performed simple but exhaustive classifications at regional level based on vegetation phenology, using extensive LULC field database, time series of MODIS NDVI satellite images and decision trees classifiers, generating an annual map for all RPG. The used technique achieved very good levels of accuracy at the regional (94.3%-95.5%) and sub-regional (78.2%-97.6%) scales, with commission and omission errors generally low (Min = 0.6, Max = 10.3, Median = 5.7, and Min = 0, Max = 41.8, Median = 6.8 for regional and sub regional classification respectively) and evenly distributed, but fails when LULC classifications are generated in years when the climate is very different from those used to generate spectral signatures and train decision trees, or when the NDVI time series accumulates large volumes of lost data. Our results show that the RPG are immersed in a strong process of land use change, mainly due to the advance of the agricultural frontier and at the expense of loss of grassland areas. The agricultural area increased 23% in the analyzed period, adding over than 50,000 Km(2) of new crops. Most agricultural expansion, and therefore the greatest losses of grassland, concentrates on both sides of Uruguay river (Mesopotamic Pampa and the western portion of Southern and Northern Campos) and the western portion of Inland Pampa. The generated maps open the door for more detailed and spatially explicit modeling of many important aspects of ecosystem functioning, for quantification in the provision of ecosystem services and for more efficient management of natural resources.

AB Fragmentation transforms natural habitats into a set of structurally and functionally differentiated small and separated patches, and causes the loss of connectivity among populations. In this study, we used a multi-temporal approach (1986, 2011 and 2016), to analyze the patterns of habitat fragmentation and to identify critical zones for the maintenance of habitat connectivity of two focal pine species (Pinus pseudostrobus and P. montezumae) with the broadest distribution and highest economic importance in the temperate forests of the Meseta Purepecha, in Michoacan, Mexico. This eco-region is currently one of the most threatened in terms of habitat degradation and extinction of forest communities. From a supervised classification of satellite images, land use coverage classes were selected and used as a basis to analyze the degree of landscape fragmentation using configuration and composition metrics and landscape connectivity based on the graph-theory approach. The fragmentation metrics suggested an increase in agricultural coverage (10.81%; fruits crop, mainly avocado), while the coverage of the forest showed a reduction (15.06%) and fragmentation throughout the study period. The landscape connectivity is lower (16.3% on average) and showed two highly important zones (Uruapan and Tancitaro) and one zone of high importance (Patzcuaro) to maintain connectivity, considering three different dispersion distances (0.5, 5.0 and 10km) for the species analyzed. We propose these three zones as potential habitat stepping stones to promote overall landscape connectivity, offering primary habitats and possible ecological resilience for this important forest ecosystem.

AB Rainfall-induced floods often cause significant loss of life as well as damage to infrastructure and crops. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) can be used to determine the extent of flooding over large geographical areas. Unlike optical sensors, SAR instruments are suitable for cloudy weather conditions, making them suitable for flood detection and mapping during extreme weather events. In this study, we explore the application of the Normalized Difference Sigma-Naught Index (NDSI) and Shannon's entropy of NDSI (SNDSI) of Sentinel-1 data for open water flooding detection, based on automatic thresholding and Bayesian probability. The proposed methodology was tested using the floods in Sofala province, Mozambique, caused by cyclone Idai on March 14-19 of 2019. Results show that thresholding of the NDSI Vertical Transmit-Horizontal Receive (VH) can produce results with Overall Accuracy above 90%, and Kappa higher than 0.6. Considerable performance improvements were obtained by our thresholding method over the entropy of NDSI, yielding results with Kappa of 0.70-0.77. Additionally, it was found that Weibull distribution can properly describe the properties of flooded pixels within the histogram of SNDSI, which allows us to generate a flood probability raster using a Bayesian approach. The final per-pixel flooding probability is useful to indicate certainty in the classification results. The SNDSI Bayesian model produced an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.93-0.97, with cross-polarized data yielding the most accurate results.

AB Understanding the changes in land use and coverage associated with the growing demand for natural resources consolidates cause and effect relationships on a wide space-time scale. Thus, the understanding and monitoring of land use and coverage is fundamental for understanding the patterns of space organization and for the sustainable planning of environments and the definition of public policies. The change in the coverage of environments associated with the growing demand for natural resources induces terrestrial ecosystems to undergo several changes, consolidating cause and effect relationships on a wide space-time scale. Thus, the understanding and monitoring of land use and coverage is fundamental for understanding the patterns of space organization and for the sustainable planning of environments. In this sense, the objective of this work is to diagnose the main types of land use and coverage in the municipality of Senhor do Bonfim - BA over the years 1986, 1996, 2009 and 2017. For this diagnosis, orbital images were used as a basis of the LANDSAT Satellite, integrated and processed in a Geographic Information System environment, through the hybrid supervised classification. The results obtained attest to the predominance of the Caatinga Shrub and demonstrate the gradual growth of agricultural crops, urban areas and forests on hillsides. In the end, the work carried out intends to collaborate to studies of landscape evolution and to help better planning proposals for the use and coverage of municipalities located in tropical semi-arid regions.

AB Soils from central Brazil have been intensively used over the last decades because of the rapid conversion of savannas (Cerrado) into corn/soybean fields. The objective of this work is to study modifications in the physical properties of soils in the Rio Verde watershed, as a function of the land use time for agriculture, determined from classification of Landsat satellite images between 1980 and 2010. Soil samples were collected at surface (0-20cm) and subsurface (20-40cm) horizons for the different classes of land use time (<10, 10-20, 20-30, and >30years). The following physical properties were measured: bulk density (BD), air permeability (K-a), penetration resistance (PR), microporosity (MI), macroporosity (MA), and total porosity (TP). Results showed a strong expansion with time of agriculture that occupied 353% (1980), 374% (1990), 513% (2000), and 609% (2010) of the watershed area. When properties were compared with those from the reference areas (preserved soils under native vegetation), significant differences were observed for all the physical attributes of soils for a land use time higher than 20years. Overall, BD and PR increased with land use time, and the opposite was verified for K-a, MA, and TP. Some physical properties presented values (e.g., 154gcm(-3) for BD and 0.06cm(3)cm(-3) for MA) close to the critical ones reported to affect crop development, but they were not still impacting on local soybean yield.

AB The advance of forestry in the Pampa biome has developed as a state political strategy neoliberalist, camouflaged in a proposal of economic development of the region of the Campanha Gaucha. This article aims to present an overview of silvicultural activities in the municipality of Rosario do Suk, located in the southwest of Rio Grande do Sul. For this, a characterization of the forestry through thematic maps was elaborated. The construction of land use maps and their respective analyzes occurred from the use of LANDSAT 5 TM satellite images for the year of 1996 and LANDSAT 8 OLI for 2016. The image classification process was carried out using the software ENVI (R) 4.8, where samples were collected referring to water bodies, arboreal-shrub vegetation, sand banks,fields, crops, forestry and urban. During the field works it was observed that the areas where are the cultivation of exotic species, are used predominantly for commercial purposes such as the manufacture of cellulose, being few cases that are being used as "windbreaks" and for the protection of livestock small properties. Based on the presented scenario, can be concluded that unlike municipalities Rio Grande do Sul, in Rosario do Sul, eucalyptus plantations occurred in areas where was destined for agriculture, and there was no need for the appropriation of new areas with native vegetal cover, thus maintaining the fields used for livestock which is a traditional practice in the area of study.

AB Recently, the advancement of agriculture in Brazil has caused very serious problems, such as deforestation and an increase in the amount of pesticides and suspended sediment that have negatively impacted the environment, especially in the Prata River basin, which is located in the Serra da Bodoquena region, Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the future changes in land use and land cover of the advancement of agriculture in the native vegetation areas of the Cerrado/Atlantic forest ecotone in the Prata River basin in 2033, 2050, 2080 and 2100. To map the future land use and land cover (LULC) in the study area, an object-based classification approach was used on Landsat satellite imagery from 1986, 1999, 2007 and 2016. The future LULC scenarios were created with a cellular automata-Markov forecast model. The simulation results of the LULC changes were considered satisfactory, as evidenced by the values obtained from the kappa for agreement (kappa(standard)) = 0.73, kappa for no information (kappa(no)) = 0.79 and kappa for grid-cell level location (kappa(location)) = 0.85 indices. The modeled future scenarios of LULC indicated the advancement of crop agriculture and decreases in wetlands (banhado), savannahs, riparian forests, seasonal semideciduous forests and wet grasslands, which can be considered a warning about the loss of biodiversity of fauna and flora in the Serra da Bodoquena National Park, mainly in the Prata River basin.

AB Image analysis using proximal sensors can help accelerate the selection process in plant breeding and improve the breeding efficiency. However, the accuracies of extracted phenotypic traits, especially those that require image classification, are affected by the pixel size in images. Ground coverage (GC), the ratio of projected to ground vegetation area to total land area, is a simple and important trait to monitor crop growth and development and is often captured by visual-spectrum cameras on multiple platforms from ground-based vehicles to satellites. In this study, we used GC as an example trait and explored its dependency on pixel size. In developing new spring wheat varieties, breeders often aim for rapid GC estimation, which is challenging especially when coverage is low (<25%) in a species with thin leaves (ranging from 2 to 15 mm across). In a wheat trial comprising 28 treatments, high-resolution images were manually taken at ca. 1 m above canopies on seven occasions from emergence to flowering. Using a cubic interpolation algorithm, the original images with small pixel size were degraded into coarse images with large pixel size (from 0.1 to 5.0 cm per pixel, 26 extra levels in total) to mimic the image acquisition at different flight heights of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based platform. A machine learning based classification model was used to classify pixels of the original images and the corresponding degraded images into either vegetation and background classes, and then computed their GCs. GCs of original images were referred as reference values to their corresponding degraded images. As pixel size increased, GC of the degraded images tended to be underestimated when reference GC was less than about 50% and overestimated for GC > 50%. The greatest errors (about 30%) were observed when reference GCs were around 30% and 70%. Meanwhile, the largest pixel sizes to distinguish between two treatments depended on the difference between GCs of the two treatments and were rapidly increased when differences were greater than the specific values at given significance levels (i.e. about 10%, 8% and 6% for P < 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1, respectively). For wheat, small pixel size (e.g. <0.1 cm) is always required to accurately estimate ground coverage when the most practical flight height is about 20 to 30 m at present. This study provides a guideline to choose appropriate pixel sizes and flight plans to estimate GC and other traits in crop breeding using UAV based HTP platforms.

AB Agricultural land abandonment is an important environmental issue in Europe. The proper management of agricultural areas has important implications for ecosystem services (food production, biodiversity, climate regulation and the landscape). In the coming years, an increase of abandoned areas is expected due to socio-economic changes. The identification and quantification of abandoned agricultural plots is key for monitoring this process and for applying management measures. The Valencian Region (Spain) is an important fruit and vegetable producing area in Europe, and it has the most important citrus industry. However, this agricultural sector is highly threatened by diverse factors, which have accelerated land abandonment. Landsat and MODIS satellite images have been used to map land abandonment. However, these images do not give good results in areas with high spatial fragmentation and small-sized agricultural plots. Sentinel-2 and airborne imagery shows unexplored potential to overcome this thanks to higher spatial resolutions. In this work, three models were compared for mapping abandoned plots using Sentinel-2 with 10 m bands, Sentinel-2 with 10 m and 20 m bands, and airborne imagery with 1 m visible and near-infrared bands. A pixel-based classification approach was used, applying the Random Forests algorithm. The algorithm was trained with 144 plots and 100 decision trees. The results were validated using the hold-out method with 96 independent plots. The most accurate map was obtained using airborne images, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Thiam's Transformed Vegetation Index (TTVI), with an overall accuracy of 88.5%. The map generated from Sentinel-2 images (10 m bands and the EVI and TTVI spectral indices) had an overall accuracy of 77.1%. Adding 20 m Sentinel-2 bands and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) did not improve the classification accuracy. According to the most accurate map, 4310 abandoned plots were detected in our study area, representing 32.5% of its agricultural surface. The proposed methodology proved to be useful for mapping citrus in highly fragmented areas, and it can be adapted to other crops.

AB Haryana has emerged as an important state for Rice & Wheat production in India contributing significantly in the central pool. Mechanized combine harvesting technologies, which have become common in Rice Wheat System (RWS) in India, leave behind large quantities of straw in the field for open burning of residue. Besides causing pollution, the burning kills the useful micro flora of the soil causing soil degradation. There is no field survey (Girdawari) data available with the Government for the areas where stubble burning is taking place. The present paper describes the methodology and results of wheat and rice residue burning areas for three districts of Haryana namely Kaithal, Kurukshetra and Karnal for the year 2010 using complete enumeration approach of multi-date IRS-P6 AWiFS and LISS-III data. In season ground truth was collected using hand held GPS and used to identify area of burnt wheat/rice residues, associated crops and land features. After geo-referencing the satellite images, district images were masked-out and multi-date image data stacks were created. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of each date was generated and used at the time of classification along with other spectral bands. The non-agricultural classes in the image included: forest, wasteland, water bodies, urban/settlement and permanent vegetation etc. The vector of these non-agriculture classes were extracted from the land use, imported and mask was generated. During the classification non-agriculture area was excluded by using mask of these classes. From this the agricultural area could be separated out. The area was estimated by computing pixels under the classified image mask. In season multi-date AWiFS data along with available single-date LISS-III data between third week of April to last week of May are found to be useful for estimation of wheat residue burning areas estimation. The data between second week of October to last week of November is useful for estimation of rice residue burning areas estimation at district level.

AB Cyclonic catastrophes frequently devastate coastal regions of Bangladesh that host around 35 million people which represents two-thirds of the total population. They have caused many problems like agricultural crop loss, forest degradation, damage to built-up areas, river and shoreline changes that are linked to people's livelihood and ecological biodiversity. There is an absence of a comprehensive assessment of the major cyclonic disasters of Bangladesh that integrates geospatial technologies in a single study. This study aims to integrate geospatial technologies with major disasters and compares them, which has not been tried before. This paper tried to identify impacts that occurred in the coastal region by major catastrophic events at a vast level using different geospatial technologies. It focuses to identify the impacts of major catastrophic events on livelihood and food production as well as compare the impacts and intensity of different disasters. Furthermore, it compared the losses among several districts and for that previous and post-satellite images of disasters that occurred in 1988, 1991, 2007, 2009, 2019 were used. Classification technique like machine learning algorithm was done in pre- to post-disaster images. For quantifying change in the indication of different factors, indices including NDVI, NDWI, NDBI were developed. "Change vector analysis" equation was performed in bands of the images of pre- and post-disaster to identify the magnitude of change. Also, crop production variance was analyzed to detect impacts on crop production. Furthermore, the changes in shallow to deep water were analyzed. There is a notable change in shallow to deep water bodies after each disaster in Satkhira and Bhola district but subtle changes in Khulna and Bagerhat districts. Change vector analysis revealed greater intensity in Bhola in 1988 and Satkhira in 1991. Furthermore, over the years 2007 and 2009 it showed medium and deep intense areas all over the region. A sharp decrease in Aus rice production is witnessed in Barishal in 2007 when cyclone "Sidr" was stricken. The declination of potato production is seen in Khulna district after the 1988 cyclone. A huge change in the land-use classes from classified images like water body, Pasture land in 1988 and water body, forest in 1991 is marked out. Besides, a clear variation in the settlement was observed from the classified images. This study explores the necessity of using more geospatial technologies in disastrous impacts assessment around the world in the context of Bangladesh and, also, emphasizes taking effective, proper and sustainable disaster management and mitigation measures to counter future disastrous impacts.

AB Center pivot irrigation systems are used to enhance crop production in many countries around the world. Establishing the location and extent of such fields provides information that assists in describing a range of agricultural metrics, including crop identification, yield forecasts, monitoring of irrigation requirements and crop water use, as well as supporting national and regional auditing, licensing and compliance efforts. However, detailed information on the number, extent and changing dynamics of agricultural fields is often lacking in many countries: nowhere more so than in developing regions. To address this lack, we performed a national scale accounting of center pivot fields in Saudi Arabia, using a three year multi-temporal analysis of Landsat-8 satellite data. A geographic object-based image analysis approach was developed based on five 50 x 50 km sub-areas extracted from Landsat data for the year 2015, and applied to delineate individual center pivot fields at a national scale for 2013, 2014 and 2015. The extent of fields was determined via a map of the annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), while a 15 m spatial resolution map of annual panchromatic band minimums was used to produce an edge detection layer to delineate individual adjoining fields. Amongst a range of classification parameters that were included in the object-based mapping approach, shape information, such as the center pivot field length, length:width ratio, and elliptic fit, were identified as critical parameters. Applying the rule-set that was developed from the five 50 x 50 km sub-regions to the national scale resulted in the identification of 36,052 (11,103 km(2)), 38,114 (11,902 km(2)), and 37,254 (11,555 km(2)) individual fields in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Approximately 94% of these fields were correctly detected, while their individually measured area was mapped with >95% combined accuracy for fields >0.225 km(2) when evaluated against manually delineated fields. Smaller center pivot fields, and specifically those adjoining neighbouring fields, had lower area mapping accuracies (>91% in 75% of cases). The object-based approach allowed a national scale and multi-temporal assessment of center pivot field delineation and mapping, affording new insights into agricultural practice and providing a methodological basis for examining the impact of water management and related policy initiatives, amongst many other potential applications. Apart from filling a clear knowledge gap in Saudi Arabia, the approach has the potential to be expanded elsewhere: particularly to similar locations within the Middle East and North Africa.

AB Our objective was to establish the pattern of variation of soil organic (SOC) and inorganic (SIC) carbon stored in surface and deep soil layers of the Argentine Pampas as affected by environmental conditions and land use. Eighty two farms, widespread over the region, were used for the study. At each farm paired treatments were sampled representing common land uses: trees, uncropped controls, seeded pastures, cropped fields and periodically flooded areas. Bulk density, SOC. SIC, texture, pH and electrical conductivity were determined to 1 m depth. Rainfall and temperature were obtained from climatic records. Significant differences were detected between treatments in SOC contents. Average SOC stocks to 1 m were: 131 t ha(-1) under trees>101 t ha(-1) in uncropped control>90 t ha(-1) in pastures =86 t ha(-1) in cropped field>and 70 t ha(-1) in flooded sites. Compared with uncropped controls. SOC was significantly different in all soil layers under trees, to 75 cm depth in flooded sites and to 50 cm in pastures and cropped soils. Agriculture determined a reduction of 16% of SOC to 50 cm in sampled sites. In the 50-100 cm depth a decrease of 9% was observed, though not significant The stratification pattern of SOC in depth was not affected by the treatments; implying that land use impacted the SOC sequestered in soil, but not its allocation in depth. SIC accounted for one third of total soil carbon, average SIC stock was 50 t C ha(-1) to 1 m. Both, its stock and distribution in the profile were not affected by the treatments; with greater SIC stocks founded in deep soil layers. An artificial neural network model was developed that allowed the estimation of SOC (R-2=0.64) based on climate, soil properties and land use. The model, linked to information from satellite image classification, was used for the estimation of present SOC stock of pampean soils, which accounted for 4.22 +/- 0.14 Gt in an area of 48.2 Mha. Using soil surveys performed during the 1960-1980 period we estimated a SOC stock of 3.96 +/- 022 Gt Consequently, no change of total SOC stock seems to be produced in the last decades in the region. At smaller scale, counties with SOC content greater than 95 t ha(-1) to 1 m depth lost carbon; increases prevailed below this threshold. Apparently. SIC reservoirs seem have not change during the last decades. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Greenness and Brightness Features
AB The expected increase in world population requires a redoubling of efforts to increase agricultural yields including rice crop which is the main food of many countries of the world and in particular the countries of the Middle East. Therefore, estimating the size of the agricultural yield should be one of the first tasks of governments in the promotion of research to achieve food security and to study the obstacles resulting from environmental degradation. The Vegetation Indices (VIs) and the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) features are particularly used to evaluate the presence and condition of vegetation, using satellite images. In this paper, new classification will introduced to harness these features to calculate the acreage of rice and compare them with the declared areas by the Ministry of Agriculture to make sure of their precisions. Typically, rice cultivation begins in the study area (Najaf Province) in mid-June and up to the top of the vegetative phase after 3 to 3.5 months (i.e. between September and October), then up to the harvest stage in thirty days (i.e. November). So, the present research will use Landsat-8 (Operational Land Imager OLI) images captured in September for the years 2013 and 2014 to ensure the validity of measurements. Among the many algorithms which have been developed for monitoring the biophysical characteristics of vegetation, only two of the six features of TCT (i.e. Brightness and Greenness have been adopted to use because they spectrally behave similarly like the Red and Infrared bands of the OLI images.

AB Humans have influenced their natural environment as long as they have existed. For thousands of years this influence was negligible or temporary. From time to time humans left their marks on the surrounding landscape, but these "marks" generally disappeared as ecosystems recovered to a more or less "pristine" state. The changes are not well known because the mysterious rises and declines of ancient cultures are poorly documented. During the last 300 years, however, the influence of humans on their surrounding landscape has increased at a staggering rate. Rapid increases in population numbers boosted the need for food and fodder. Land needed for crops and ranching expanded mostly at the cost of forests and natural grass-lands. Estimates of the decrease in global forested area during the last 300 years range from 8 to 13 million km(2), corresponding with 15% to 25% of the forest extent in 1700. Approximately 15 to 19 million km(2) of natural grassland and savanna were also domesticated to some extent. Much of the uncertainty in these estimates can be explained by the use of different classification schemes of historical inventories, different methodological approaches, and the absence of present-day technologies, such as satellites, for measurement of change. Nevertheless, these land-use changes are large enough to have contributed significantly to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that roughly one fifth of the total anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases during the 1990s were from changes in land use.

AB With the declines in water levels of the Central and Southern High Plains Aquifer, there is a critical need to accurately map the irrigated agriculture in this region as it is the largest user of groundwater resources. The goal of this study was to develop a geospatial database of all areas under the most dominant irrigation system in the region: center pivots. The borders of all center pivots (50,116) were manually digitized using high spatial resolution satellite imagery, delineating the area that can be potentially irrigated by these systems. Most center pivots were comparable in size (ca. 50 ha), with a range of 1 to >230 ha. The areas of digitized center pivots at the state and study area levels were relatively close to estimates of two actual irrigated area products based on automatic land classification. The new layer was also used to extract available data on groundwater level changes since predevelopment (before 1950). Aquifer regions under center pivots in Colorado and Texas had the smallest and largest declines in water level, respectively. The new layer offers advantages in terms of accurately identifying the area covered by center pivots and has potential research and practical applications such as studying adopted practices in response to water level declines, assessing field-scale irrigation uniformity, and extracting distributed soil, weather, and crop data to be used in various precision agriculture applications. The new layer is freely available to the public as supplemental information of this article (https://doi.org/10.13031/14707284).

AB Scenes from the series of multispectral sensors on the Landsat satellites were used to map recent changes (between 1972 and 2004) in forest cover within and adjacent to stream networks of an intensively farmed region of the southern Great Barrier Reef catchment (Australia). Unsupervised ISODATA classifications of Tasseled-Cap transformed data (at 57 m ground resolution) mapped forest and cleared areas within 150 m of Pisoneer catchment waterways with 72.2% overall accuracy (K-hat = 0.469), when adjusted for the size of each class. Although the user's accuracy was higher for the forest class (82.1 +/- 8.4% at alpha = 0.05), large errors of commission (34.2 +/- 8.3%) substantially affected map accuracy for the cleared class. The main reasons for misclassification include: (1) failure to discriminate narrowly vegetated riparian strips; (2) misregistration of scenes; and (3) spectral similarity of ground cover. Error matrix probabilities were used to adjust the mapped area of classes, resulting in a decline of forest cover by 12.3% and increase of clearing by 18.5% (22.4 km(2) change; 95% confidence interval: 14.3-29.6 km(2)) between 1972 and 2004. Despite the mapping errors, Landsat data were able to identify broad patterns of land cover change that were verified from aerial photography. Most of the forest losses occurred in open forest to woodland habitat dominated by Eucalyptus, Corymbia, and Lophostemon species, which were largely replaced by sugarcane cropping. Melaleuca communities were similarly affected, though they have a much smaller distribution in the catchment.

AB High spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery are essential data for land cover discrimination and mapping of vegetation dynamics, offering insights into the number, extent, and condition of agricultural fields. However, an accurate account of the number, location, and variability of fields can be challenging to obtain in a timely manner, particularly at scale or in regions where ground-supporting data are not available, limiting the capacity for food production and water use assessment and planning. To bridge this capacity gap, a convolutional neural network approach was adopted and combined with two clustering techniques: the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and spectral clustering, to provide an account of agricultural fields and their extent across a region lacking ground based information. A random forest classification was also employed to discriminate crop types. Using an annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 2018 Landsat-8 data, the approach was applied to classify the shape and delineate the extent of agricultural fields across an agricultural region in Saudi Arabia that had an area under irrigation exceeding 2,300 km(2). When assessed against manually identified center-pivot fields (CPFs), the method achieved 97.4% producer's and 98.0% user's accuracies on an object basis, and 81.4% producer's and 85.4% user's accuracies on a pixel basis for identifying non-CPFs (i.e., tree crop plantations and other non-woody crops). The over-and under-segmentation error for CPFs was 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, with intersection over union errors reported as being 3.5%. The framework showed stability when retrospectively applied to Landsat data from the year 2000, returning 97.5% producer's and 96.6% user's accuracies for CPF identification. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics of agricultural development over the past three decades, an analysis of field behavior between 1988 and 2020 was subsequently undertaken. The analysis indicated that the number of CPFs in the study region increased from 45 (covering 20 km(2)) in 1988 to 5,080 CPFs by 2016 (covering 2,368 km(2)), followed by a recent reduction to 3,700 CPFs in 2020 (covering 1,581 km(2)). Through the multi-temporal analysis, individual fields were able to be characterized in terms of their expansion, contraction and activity throughout the study period. Overall, the proposed method was simple to train, efficient in dealing with large datasets, relied on limited in-situ records to a very small degree, and has the potential to be applied to larger national scales, providing an ongoing assessment of important agroinformatic metrics.

AB Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) is one of the most noxious herbaceous weeds in the world with adverse impacts on among others animal and human health, crop production, the environment, local as well as national economies. To optimize Parthenium mitigation, it is necessary to accurately monitor its spread using earth observation data. However, one of the challenges of mapping Parthenium weed is that its spectral response is similar to that of surrounding herbaceous plant species, resulting in low classification accuracies. Due to variability in its phenological characteristics and associated species, determining differences within the growing season may optimize the discrimination and subsequent mapping of the Parthenium weed. However, determination of the window(s) with the most prominent variability has been overlooked in past studies. Furthermore, no specific algorithm has been determined to be efficient in finding such window(s). ExtraTrees (EXT), an underused classifier in earth observation studies, possess interesting properties for satellite image processing such as high speed and performance. In this regard, this study attempted to (1) determine the optimal window period for discriminating Parthenium weed from coexisting plant species and (2) to compare the performance of EXT and the random forest (RF) algorithms. Results showed that the beginning of February was the optimal period for mapping Parthenium weed, with overall accuracy of 88.1%. EXT outperformed RF for most of the dates. This study lays the foundation for optimizing earth observation data derived models for characterizing invasive species, leveraging on the high temporal resolution of the new generation sensors.

AB This study analyzed more than 50 years of land cover and land use changes in the 260 km(2) Koga catchment in North Western Ethiopia. The data used includes 1: 50,000 scale aerial photographs, Landsat MSS, TM and ETM images, and ASTER images together with ground truth data collected through field surveys and community elders' interviews. Aerial photographs have high spatial resolution but provide lower spectral resolution than satellite data. While most land use/cover change studies compare changes from different spatial scales, this study applied land use/cover classification techniques to bring the data to a relatively similar scale. The data revealed that woody vegetation decreased from 5,576 ha to 3,012 ha from the 1950s to 2010. Most of the deforestation took place between the 1970s and 1980s, but there is an increasing trend since then. No significant changes were observed in the area used for agriculture that comprises the pastures and crop fields since the 1950s, while there is an enormous increase in the area used for settlement, due to a tremendous increase in population from one point in time to another. The bare lands that used to exist in previous years were found to be totally covered with other land cover/use classes and no bare lands were observed in the study area in the year 2010. Population pressure and land use policies were found to be reasons for the changes in land use/cover while soil degradation, decrease in the indigenous woody vegetation and erosion were the observed consequences of the land use/cover changes.

AB To explore precision farming profits, the variability within a plot can be evaluated using digital technology by different remote means. The objectives of this study were to determine crop coverage (CC) of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merril) with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data obtained by digital photographs on the field and from the satellites LANDSAT (7 and 8), with an overpass each 16 days and a pixel of 30 m, and PROBA-V, which has daily frequency and 100 m of spatial resolution, in order to evaluate productivity differences between sectors of a 45 ha rainfed plot located at south of Cordoba city, Argentina. In the plot, sowed on 22/11/2014 and harvested on 10/04/2015, 16 sampling areas were established to record periodically photographs with a modified camera and, in 8 of them, supplementary crop information. A non-linear model was developed from NDVI data of digital camera (NDVIc) to estimate the soybean CC that showed an appropriate predictive performance. Furthermore, NDVI data of LANDSAT (7 and 8) (NDVIL) and PROBA-V (NDVIp-v) were also applied to estimate CC, resulting in models whose structure and accuracy was similar to that obtained with the digital camera (R-2 = 0.956 and 0.939, respectively). According to the radiometric information the two instruments provide, the digital images classification procedure to determine CC requires increasing the threshold from 0.0 to 0.05 when soybean progresses towards the maturation and senescence stages and green material is mixed with the senescent one. Growing conditions were very favorable for soybean in 2014-2015, since precipitation (PP) not only showed a marked continuity with 60 rainy days during the cycle, but also 642 mm accumulated in this period far exceeded maximum evapotranspiration (ETmax) of 389 mm. The CC had a major development in all sectors, maintaining a complete coverage condition for more than 50 days during most of the reproductive stage. However, prevalent overcast sky restricted significantly solar radiation (SR) and reduced potential yield (PY) to an average value close to 6000 kg ha(-1) which, according to the plot yield map, produced a reduced yield gap (YG) between 10.6 and 19.8%. From the proposed model and with the NDVI data of LANDSAT 7 (NDVI7), soybean CC was estimated in the same plot for 2010-2011. Water availability were less favorable in this case, with accumulated values of 584 mm and 460 mm, for PP and ETmax, respectively, while a higher availability of SR during the crop season increased notably PY that reached a range between 7347 and 8224 kg ha(-1). Moreover, lower water availability was evidenced increasing YG in the plot (40-53%). From the spatial evaluation carried out, only one-third of the plot located at the south reached the highest productivity in both crop seasons, leaving open the question about the weather influence in each productive cycle with respect to the effectiveness of the site-specific management.

AB This paper presents a case study of land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes from 1975 to 2014 in the central highlands of Ethiopia and traces out its impact on socioeconomic conditions of the local community in the study area. We used four time series Landsat satellite images, that is, Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat Thematic Mapper (1986), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (2000), and Landsat 8 OLI scenes (2014), to investigate the changes in LULC. In addition, individual interviews with 51 randomly selected households, discussions with focus group and key informants, and field observations were also incorporated for the study. The image classification indicated four categories of LULC classes: Natural forest, eucalyptus plantations, cropland/settlements, and grasslands. Between 1975 and 2014, cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations considerably increased, whereas grassland cover drastically decreased. According to the results, the area under cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations increased by 62 and 335%, respectively, with 74% concomitant decrease in the area of grasslands in the same period. Survey results showed that deterioration of soil fertility (41.2%) followed by shortage of land (35.3%) is the major constraint for crop production for poor farmers in the study area. However, better-off farmers ranked deterioration of soil fertility (64.7%) followed by lack of credit (17.6%) as priority constraints for crop production. Interviews mainly focused on selected women group revealed that the expansion of eucalyptus in the area greatly curbed the burdens of collecting fuel woods from long distances in the past. The availability of too many religious holidays (on average 16days/month) directly or indirectly contributes to the current seasonal food shortages of the community. Generally, our results show that the community in the study area is beset with a host of social, economic, and institutional challenges. As a result, majority of the farming households are destitute, unable to make a livelihood from their small plot of land and live in absolute poverty. Therefore, in light of these finding, it is imperative that timely interventions by government and other development stakeholders are needed to come to grips with problems of soil fertility, land-use change, and food insecurity in the study area.

AB Over the last 2 decades, geospatial technologies such as Geographic Information System and spatial interpolation methods have facilitated the development of increasingly accurate spatially explicit assessments of soil erosion. Despite these advances, current modelling approaches rest on (a) an insufficient definition of the proportion of arable land that is exploited for crop production and (b) a neglect of the intra-annual variability of soil cover conditions in arable land. To overcome these inaccuracies, this study introduces a novel spatio-temporal approach to compute an enhanced cover-management factor (C) for revised universal soil loss equation-based models. It combines highly accurate agricultural parcel information contained in the Land Parcel Identification System with an object-oriented Landsat imagery classification technique to assess spatial conditions and interannual variability of soil cover conditions at field scale. With its strong link to Land Parcel Identification System and Earth observation satellite data, the approach documents an unprecedented representation of farming operations. This opens the door for the transition from the currently used potential soil erosion risk assessments towards the assessment of the actual soil erosion risk. Testing this method in a medium-size catchment located in the Swiss Plateau (Upper Enziwigger River Catchment), this study lays an important foundation for the application of the very same methods for large-scale or even pan-European applications. Soil loss rates modelled in this study were compared with the insights gained from emerging techniques to differentiate sediment source contribution through compound-specific isotope analysis on river sediments. The presented technique is adaptable beyond revised universal soil loss equation-type soil erosion models.

AB The Pannonian Plain is one of the centers of ragweed distribution in Europe. The province of Vojvodina (Serbia) is located on the southern part of the Pannonian Plain, representing a highly infested region. In this study, we have used the SILAM atmospheric dispersion model to simulate ragweed pollen concentrations during the season 2016 in the Vojvodina region. SILAM was tested with three different source maps of ragweed distribution in Vojvodina only: (1) map used in operational SILAM, which was calibrated with the SILAM model and observations, (2) map derived using "top-down" approach with land cover data inventory, and (3) map obtained with "top-down" approach using crop classification from the satellite data. Additionally, the sensitivity studies were done using two modified maps to study the effect of the source strength and long-range transport. Results of simulations were validated with the bi-hourly, daily, and seasonal pollen concentrations measured at five stations in Vojvodina. Overall Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.51 (Map 1), 0.50 (Map 2), and 0.42 (Map 3), while debiased scores were 232.95 pollen m(-3) (Map 1), 245.59 pollen m(-3) (Map 2), and 258.24 pollen m(-3) (Map 3). Even though Vojvodina is in the area of a major European source, regional transport of ragweed pollen from a few hundred kilometers of the surrounding area was important in explaining the presence of pollen in the afternoon hours, although it could not completely explain total pollen quantity. The results confirmed that it is vital to calibrate source maps using atmospheric dispersion model with the observed pollen data.

AB Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type, crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area - defined as continental to global - cropland mapping is challenging due to differential manifestation of croplands, wide range of cultivation practices and limited reference data availability. This study presents the results of a cropland extent mapping of 64 countries covering large parts of Europe, Middle East, Russia and Central Asia. To cover such a vast area, roughly 160,000 Landsat scenes from 3351 footprints between 2014 and 2016 were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We used a pixel-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm with a set of satellite data inputs capturing diverse spectral, temporal and topographical characteristics across twelve agroecological zones (AEZs). The reference data to train the classification model were collected from very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) and ancillary datasets. The result is a binary map showing cultivated/non-cultivated areas ca. 2015. The map produced an overall accuracy of 93.8% with roughly 14% omission and commission errors for the cropland class based on a large set of independent validation samples. The map suggests the entire study area has a total 546 million hectares (Mha) of net croplands (nearly 30% of global net cropland areas) occupying 18% of the study land area. Comparison between national cropland area estimates from United Nations Food and Agricultural Organizations (FAO) and those derived from this work also showed an R-square value of 0.95. This Landsat-derived 30-m cropland product (GFSAD30) provided 10-30% greater cropland areas compared to UN FAO in the 64 Countries. Finally, the map-to-map comparison between GFSAD30 with several other cropland products revealed that the best similarity matrix was with the 30 m global land cover (GLC30) product providing an overall similarity of 88.8% (Kappa 0.7) with producer's cropland similarity of 89.2% (errors of omissions = 10.8%) and user's cropland similarity of 81.8% (errors of commissions = 8.1%). GFSAD30 captured the missing croplands in GLC30 product around significantly irrigated agricultural areas in Germany and Belgium and rainfed agriculture in Italy. This study also established that the real strengths of GFSAD30 product, compared to other products, were: 1. identifying precise location of croplands, and 2. capturing fragmented croplands. The cropland extent map dataset is available through NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at tps://doi.org,10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30EUMARUMECE.001, while the training and reference data as well as visualization are available at the Global Croplands <https://croplands.org > website, GEE code is accessible at: https://code.earthengine.google.com/1666e8bed34e0ce2b2aaf1235ad8c6bd.

AB This contribution highlights the advantages of using a multidisciplinary modelling approach to the characterisation of the environmental dynamics of a typical semi-arid Mediterranean region, the Flumendosa river basin located in central Sardinia (Italy). Here, the widespread presence of geomorphological active techniques as support tools. Radiometric enhancement and supervised classification processing of multitemporal Landsat(TM) images were used to derive land cover information, allowing to understand the seasonal evolution of the area arid to monitor the presence and movement of organic materials These data were then combined with those derived from ground truth and ground Survey campaigns concerning not only geology arid geomorphology, but also pedology, land use arid vegetation coverage. At the same time, rainfall simulations were carried out in order to evaluate the principal parameters involved in the soil erosion processes, On these data a hydro-geomorphological model based on the spatial prevalence or the different erosion processes, In drought-prone semi-arid Mediterranean regions characterised by an ancient geomorphologic evolution such as the area tinder examination, erosion processes are mainly controlled by the relative contribution of soil properties, land use mid morphologic parameters, The different combinations of these induce the spatial prevalence of either erosion by overland flow or erosion by subsurface flow, which, together with other processes less important in the studied area, contribute to the existence of a given erosion hazard for each portion of the basin. A model for the prediction of the relative soil loss hazard should hence take into account both phenomena. Generally speaking erosion by overland no, is the prevalent process in the Flumendosa basin but in hillslopes where appropriate conditions are met pipe kind seepage flow can greatly contribute to the overall sediment production and transport, Thee conditions are mainly. i) a highly variable rainfall between seasons, ii) the presence of an underlying impermeable layer In the soil;, in) regolith materials prone to shrinking-swelling phenomena. iv) human or naturally induced reduction of the Vegetation cover and. v) the presence of at least one dispersible processes interacts with the consequences of intense human activities on crop cultivation and forest management to produce a fragile environment the equilibrium of which must be carefully surveyed and maintained. To this end, an hydro-geomorphological soil erosion hazard model was devised and applied on the slope basin, using remote sensing and G.I.S.
   was applied. Six main parameters (i.e. soil crosivity, land use, hillslope gradient and curvature, contributing area arid soil infiltration capacity.) were used and combined with a matrix linear combination, At the last, the results were tested and validated using the Following geomorphological and soil parameters or the soil database. slope, drainage. surface texture.

AB Remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for weed detection is a valuable asset in agriculture and is vastly used for site-specific weed control. Alongside site-specific methods, time-specific weed control is another critical aspect of precision weed control where, by using different models, it is possible to determine the time of weed species emergence. This study combined site-specific and time-specific weed control methods to explore their collective benefits for precision weed control. Using the AlertInf model, a weed emergence prediction model, the cumulative emergence of Sorghum halepense was calculated, following the selection of the best date for the UAV survey when the emergence was predicted to be at 96%. The survey was executed using a UAV with visible range sensors, resulting in an orthophoto with a resolution of 3 cm, allowing for good weed detection. The orthophoto was post-processed using two separate methods: an artificial neural network (ANN) and the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) to discriminate between the weeds, the crop, and the soil. Finally, a model was applied for the creation of prescription maps with different cell sizes (0.25 m(2), 2 m(2), and 3 m(2)) and with three different decision-making thresholds based on pixels identified as weeds (>1%, >5%, and >10%). Additionally, the potential savings in herbicide use were assessed using two herbicides (Equip and Titus Mais Extra) as examples. The results show that both classification methods have a high overall accuracy of 98.6% for ANN and 98.1% for VARI, with the ANN having much better results concerning user/producer accuracy and Cohen's Kappa value (k 83.7 ANN and k 72 VARI). The reduction percentage of the area to be sprayed ranged from 65.29% to 93.35% using VARI and from 42.43% to 87.82% using ANN. The potential reduction in herbicide use was found to be dependent on the area. For the Equip herbicide, this reduction ranged from 1.32 L/ha to 0.28 L/ha for the ANN; with VARI the reduction in the amounts used ranged from 0.80 L/ha to 0.15 L/ha. Meanwhile, for Titus Mais Extra herbicide, the reduction ranged from 46.06 g/ha to 8.19 g/ha in amounts used with the ANN; with VARI the amount reduction ranged from 27.77 g/ha to 5.32 g/ha. These preliminary results indicate that combining site-specific and time-specific weed control might significantly reduce herbicide use with direct benefits for the environment and on-farm variable costs. Further field studies are needed for the validation of these results.

AB An experimental site was set up in a large, flat and homogeneous area of rice crops for the validation of satellite derived land surface temperature (LST). Experimental campaigns were held in the summers of 2002-2004, when rice crops show full vegetation cover. LSTs were measured radiometrically along transects covering an area of 1 km(2). A total number of four thermal radiometers were used, which were calibrated and inter-compared through the campaigns. Radiometric temperatures were corrected for emissivity effects using field emissivity and downwelling sky radiance measurements. A database of ground-based LSTs corresponding to morning, cloud-free overpasses of Envisat/ Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is presented. Ground LSTs ranged from 25 to 32 degrees C, with uncertainties between +/-0.5 and +/-0.9 degrees C. The largest part of these uncertainties was due to the spatial variability of surface temperature. The database was used for the validation of LSTs derived from the operational AATSR and MODIS split-window algorithms, which are currently used to generate the LST product in the L2 level data. A quadratic, emissivity dependent split-window equation applicable to both AATSR and MODIS data was checked as well. Although the number of cases analyzed is limited (five concurrences for AATSR and eleven for MODIS), it can be concluded that the split-window algorithms work well, provided that the characteristics of the area are adequately prescribed, either through the classification of the land cover type and the vegetation cover, or with the surface emissivity. In this case, the AATSR LSTs yielded an average error or bias of - 0.9 degrees C (ground minus algorithm), with a standard deviation of 0.9 degrees C. The MODIS LST product agreed well with the ground LSTs, with differences comparable or smaller than the uncertainties of the ground measurements for most of the days (bias of +0.1 degrees C and standard deviation of 0.6 degrees C, for cloud-free cases and viewing angles smaller than 60 degrees). The quadratic split-window algorithm resulted in small average errors (+'0.3 degrees C for AATSR and 0.0 degrees C for MODIS), with differences not exceeding +/-1.0 degrees C for most of the days (standard deviation of 0.9 degrees C for AATSR and 0.5 degrees C for MODIS).

AB Monitoring spatial and temporal variability of Vegetation Indices (VIs) is important to manage land and water resources, with significant impact on the sustainability of modern agriculture.
   Although algorithms based on optical data give accurate products, cloud cover dramatically reduces the temporal resolution of these outputs. The launch of new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constellations such as COSMO-Skymed opened new opportunities to develop agro-hydrological applications. Indeed, these satellites may represent a suitable source of data for operational applications due to their high spatial and temporal resolutions (10 m in StripMap PingPong acquisition mode, best revisit time with 4 satellites: 4 images per day at equator; every 7 hours on average at 40 latitude). Although X band is not optimal for agricultural and hydrological applications, reliable continuous assessment of the VIs can be achieved combing optical and SAR images. To this aim, an algorithm was implemented and validated coupling a VI derived from optical DEIMOS images (VIopt) and the crossed HV backscattering sigma(HV)degrees (PingPong in HV polarization).
   A correlation analysis has been performed between sigma degrees and VIs measurements taken simultaneously to Cosmo-SkyMed acquisitions in several plots. The correlation analysis was based on: incidence angle, spatial resolution and polarization mode. Results have shown that temporal changes of sigma(HV)degrees(Delta sigma(0)(HV)), acquired with high angles (off nadir angle, theta > 40 degrees) is characterized by the best correlation with variations of VI (Delta VI). The correlation between Delta VI and Delta sigma(0)(HV) is shown to be temporally robust. Based on this experimental evidence a model to infer VISAR at the time t(i+1) once known the VIopt at a reference time, t(i) and Delta sigma(0)(HV) between times t(i+1) and t(i), was implemented and verified.
   The study is carried out over the SELE plain (Campania, Italy) mainly characterized by herbaceous crops. Five couples of COSMO-Skymed and optical DEIMOS images have been acquired between August and September 2011. Data have been collected within the COSMOLAND project (Use of COSMO-SkyMed SAR data for LAND cover classification and surface parameters retrieval over agricultural sites) funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Results confirm that VISAR obtained using the combined model is a satisfactory surrogate of the VIopt.

AB Waterbirds have high potential as bioindicators of the status and functioning of estuarine ecosystems, because they respond to multiple stress factors in a wide range of spatial scales. The objective of this study was to analyze the dependence of the population size of waterbird species with different degrees of association with waterbodies (High: HAW, Low: LAW) on attributes of the surrounding landscape. This was accomplished by long-term monitoring (2006-2015) of the populations of waterbirds in three estuaries of central Chile; the Itata, Mataquito, and Reloca Rivers. We acquired data on the composition and structure of the landscape for each site from satellite sensors (Landsat TM5, ETM+7 and OLI 8), specifically the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI). We also obtained the covers of grassland and crops, bare soil and shrubland annually (summer) using a supervised classification. Using point-count data (2013-2015) from the landscape surrounding the Itata estuary, we compared the proportion of the population of different species present within and outside the wetland. The negative temporal correlation (p<0.05) between the number of Yellow-billed pintails (Anas georgica) inside and outside the estuary strongly suggests the movement of individuals between these two habitats. We found that the abundance of many species in in the estuaries was affected by the variation of some landscape attributes. However, that proportion of LAW and HAW species showing such relationships did not differ significantly. The most important attributes of the landscape for waterbird populations were moisture (flooded sites) and vegetation photosynthetic vigor, shrubland cover. The growing use of waterbird population data as an environmental monitoring tool requires a deep understanding of the factors that drive the changes in both population numbers but also in the data describing the latter. This study highlights the importance of incorporating into waterbird population assessments information from both inside the waterbodies and from their surrounding landscapes.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Land use planning and management is considered a very complex issue since it is usually solved by the multisectoral-interdisciplinary hierarchy decomposition approaches. In general, land use planning indicates the consideration of integrating biophysical and socio-economic variables. Evaluation of biophysical variables is usually a first step for land use analysis and it involves the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE). This study aims at integrating biophysical and socio-economic data with Geographical Information System (GIS) for land suitability evaluation of irrigated wheat cultivation. The selected area is located in Haripur Upazila, Thakurgaon district, north-west part of Bangladesh. The major economic crops in this area are rice and wheat. Relevant biophysical variables such as soil texture, soil moisture, soil drainage, soil depth, soil pH, soil organic matter, slope, land type and supplementary water resource were considered. The socio-economic factors used in this study were availability of manpower, market linkage and road linkage. The suitability is based on the FAO framework for land evaluation. For MCE, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied for judging the parameters and computing the priority index to each parameter. The various thematic layers were overlaid using ArcGIS version 9.2 software to create land suitability map of unique characteristics. To generate current land use/cover map, Terra/ASTER 28 February 2001 satellite image was classified through supervised classification using ERDAS Imagine version 9.1 software. Finally, we overlaid the land use/cover map with the land suitability map for wheat cultivation to identify differences and similarities between the present and potential land use. The results of this research identified that in the study area, 34% of current wheat fields were under moderately suitable areas, 35% was under marginally suitable areas and 31% was under not suitable areas.

AB This research illustrates the technical efficiency of the pan-India paddy cultivation status obtained through a stochastic frontier approach. The results suggest that the mean technical efficiency varies from 0.64 in Gujarat to 0.95 in Odisha. Inputs like human labor, mechanical labor, fertilizer, irrigation and insecticide were found to determine the yield in paddy cultivation across India (except for Chhattisgarh). Inefficiency in the paddy production in Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha in 2016-2017 was caused by technical inefficiency due to poor input management, as suggested by the significant sigma U-2 and sigma(2)v values of the stochastic frontier model. In addition, most of the farm groups in the study operated in the high-efficiency group (80-90% technical efficiency). No specific pattern of input use can be visualized through descriptive measures to give any specific policy implication. Thus, machine learning algorithms based on the input parameters were tested on the data in order to predict the farmers' efficiency class for individual states. The highest mean accuracy of 0.80 for the models of all of the states was achieved in random forest models. Among the various states of India, the best random forest prediction model based on accuracy was fitted to the input data of Bihar (0.91), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.89), Andhra Pradesh (0.88), Assam (0.88) and West Bengal (0.86). Thus, the study provides a technique for the classification and prediction of a farmer's efficiency group from the levels of input use in paddy cultivation for each state in the study. The study uses the DES input dataset to classify and predict the efficiency group of the farmer, as other machine learning models in agriculture have used mostly satellite, spectral imaging and soil property data to detect disease, weeds and crops.

AB The potential for direct detection of chemicals on vegetation and for detecting vegetation stress and damage from exposure was reviewed within the context of the proposed Hyperspectral Environment and Resource Observer ( HERO) satellite mission. The direct detection of 10 selected toxic chemicals was deemed unlikely. Detecting vegetation stress resulting from exposure to these chemicals may be feasible, based on several image analysis approaches considered for two levels of damage: (i) severe defoliation, mortality, and effects at the full crop or forest stand scale; and (ii) more subtle stress and damage such as discolouration, spotting, bleaching, and light defoliation that occur at subpixel scales. Image classification, vegetation indices, spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and change detection are expected to be suitable for the former, whereas only SMA and advanced modelling approaches are expected to be suitable for the latter because of the subtle nature of reflectance change at subpixel scales. A key recommendation is the need for a spectral library of toxic substances and the stress and damage caused to various types of vegetation at different growth stages. Current information on this is limited and represents a constraint to effective analysis and evaluation. Based on this application, HERO mission parameters were considered, with recommendations that the current spectral resolution and ground sampling distance (GSD) be improved, with a sensitivity analysis required to determine proper values to provide optimal detection of toxic hazards and vegetation stress. Other sensor and mission parameters such as spectral range, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), swath width, and orbital repeat period with off-nadir sensing and temporal relook frequency were deemed acceptable, but improvements would be desirable. Extensive testing involving laboratory experiments and airborne hyperspectral imagery for a variety of toxic substances over different areas and vegetation types is required for assessment using different image analysis algorithms to confirm this and other recommendations for HERO prelaunch.

AB We presented a methodology to accurately classify mountainous regions in the tropics. These landscapes are complex in terms of their geology, ecosystems, climate and land use. Obtaining accurate maps to assess land cover change is essential. The objectives of this study were to (1) map vegetation using the Random Forest Classifier (RFC), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and ancillar geographic data (2) identify important variables that help differentiate vegetation cover, and (3) assess the accuracy of the vegetation cover classification in hard-to-reach Ecuadorian mountain region. We used Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images of the entire scene, a RFC algorithm, and stratified random sampling. The altitude and the two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) provide more information on vegetation cover than the traditional and often use normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in other settings. We classified the vegetation cover of mountainous areas within the 1016 km(2) area of study, at 30 m spatial resolution, using RFC that yielded a land cover map with an overall accuracy of 95%. The user's accuracy and the half-width of the confidence interval for 95% of the basic map units, forest (FOR), paramo (PAR), crop (CRO) and pasture (PAS) were 95.85% +/- 2.86%, 97.64% +/- 1.24%, 91.53% +/- 3.35% and 82.82% +/- 7.74%, respectively. The overall disagreement was 4.47%, which results from adding 0.43% of quantity disagreement and 4.04% of allocation disagreement. The methodological framework presented in this paper and the combined use of SVIs, ancillary geographic data, and the RFC allowed the accurate mapping of hard-to-reach mountain landscapes as well as uncovering the underlying factors that help differentiate vegetation cover in the Ecuadorian mountain geosystem.

AB Leaf area index (LAI), the most frequently used parameter for monitoring agricultural ecology, could be utilized to provide scientific basis for crop disease, growth and carbon cycle monitoring as well as yield estimation. Vegetation indices (VIs), which can be employed to indicate LAI, are important data sources for satellite-based LAI production. And the most widely used one is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Several standard satellite LAI products such as MODIS use NDVI as an input. However, the saturation characteristics of NDVI would introduce errors in the production of LAI. To find a possible optimized VI to derive the LAI of rice, 28 sets of spectral observations and corresponding LAI data were collected in the sample fields of Jiangxi Province. Four commonly used VIs including NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) were extracted based on the in suit rice spectra. The response performance of the ground-based VIs to concurrent LAI measurements was assessed in this study. The linear regression results showed that the other three VIs had better adaptability than NDVI (R-2 =0. 38), while EVI had the best performance (R-2 =0. 82). MSAVI (R-2 =0. 744) and SAVI (R-2 =0. 751 1) also showed a better performance than NDVI. To continue, the differences between the results of ground-based model and the lookup table of MODIS LAI backup algorithm were compared. The MODIS LAI backup algorithm was derived from the empirical relationship between NDVI and LAI based on eight coarse biomass types. For biomass 1, it contained cereal and grass, and rice belonged to this category. In this paper, the lookup table of biomass 1 based on MODIS LAI backup algorithm was validated using the in situ LAI and spectral observations. The mean predict error of the algorithm was more than 3. 2; and mean relative tolerance was up to 530%. This means large error will be introduced in rice LAI monitoring of this area if we use MODIS LAI backup algorithm. The low accuracy of MODIS backup algorithm may be caused by the coarse biomass classification system. In fact, different vegetation types included in biomass 1 had very significant difference in their canopy characteristics. Mixing them all in one class would result in an unacceptable errors to the LAI inversion for a specified crop type such as rice. The different saturation ranges of NDVI to inverse the LAI were also considered. The NDVI values kept unchanged with the increase of LAI when LAI was greater than 4 in the MODIS backup algorithm. Nevertheless, for the regression based on the rice field measured LAI and spectral observations, the saturation domain of NDVI was reached when LAI was larger than 2. After that, the accuracy comparison of the four ground-based VI models implemented using root mean square error. The results showed that the mean predict error for NDVI model was 1. 019 and only 0. 55 for EVI model, which was only 1/6 of MODIS backup algorithm and 1/2 of NDVI model. Compared with the other three VIs, an addition blue band was utilized in the calculation of EVI to attenuate the aerosol impact on red band. This may be one of the possible reasons to explain the better performance of EVI. Therefore, an algorithm based on EVI could be developed as an alternative approach to improve the accuracy of LAI inversion.

ID INTERFEROMETRIC SAR
AB A method has been investigated for the measurement of topography using airborne fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Terrain slopes in both the range and azimuthal directions have been estimated using multipass flight geometries. Using these slope values, the Poisson equation was then solved to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the terrain topography. The method measures polarimetric orientation angles which are then converted into terrain slopes in the azimuthal direction. The conversion of these orientation angles into terrain slopes requires additional knowledge of the radar look angle and the range direction terrain slopes. The solution for slopes is, therefore, a problem coupled between the range and azimuthal directions. For specialized multipass flight geometries these orthogonal terrain slopes are solved for, and maps of terrain slopes are produced. In particular, the processing of two-pass orthogonal and two-pass antiparallel (headings Theta and Theta+ 180 degrees) NASA - Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne SAR data sets has been carried out for an area in central California. When orthogonal slopes are derived using either of these data sets, a digital elevation model may be generated. The L band, polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) DEM created by this solution is compared to a coregistered C band, interferometric SAR (IFSAR) DEM. Similar comparisons are made for terrain slopes in the azimuthal - range directions which are generated by the POLSAR and IFSAR elevation data. The polarimetric SAR, operating from an aircraft, or satellite, in a strip-mapping mode, is capable of measuring terrain topography for large areas provided that phase-preserving fully polarimetric data are taken. Polarimetric SAR data are also widely used for studies of crop classification, surface roughness, biomass density, and soil moisture content. All of these studies are adversely affected by scattering changes attributable to topography. The technique investigated here potentially offers a means to correct for these effects by making simultaneous, coregistered estimates of local orthogonal terrain slopes.

DE Slope failure; Landslide; Debris slide/flow; Rockfall/slide; Rock
   glacier; Slope-failure complex
AB Mass movements in northeastern Afghanistan include large-scale rockslides and complex slope failures, as well as failures in loess. The loess region in northeastern Afghanistan occurs in the Badakhshan and Takhar provinces and was likely created by dust blown to the east from the Karakum Desert and the alluvial plains of northern Afghanistan. This loessic dust was deposited against the Hindu Kush mountain range which rises up along the eastern half of Afghanistan as a result of transpressional tectonism. It overlies less permeable crystalline and sedimentary bedrocks such as Triassic granite, Proterozoic gneiss, and Miocene and Pliocene clastics in the area with the largest concentration of slope failures. Thirty-four loess slides and flows were mapped and analyzed using remote satellite imagery over digital elevation models on Google Earth (TM). This source enabled location, classification, and measurement of failures. Findings revealed that most failed slopes faced north, west, and northwest. This trend can be explained possibly as different moisture contents resulting from the primarily westerly wind direction, which may cause more precipitation to be deposited on west-facing slopes, and sun position during the hottest part of the day. Additionally, the easterly rising Hindu Kush range may cause more slope area to face west in the study region. Other contributing factors could be the very high seismicity of the area, which may cause rapid dry fluidized loess flows, and landscape modification by humans. Several loess slope failures appear to be generated by water concentration through irrigation ditches and possible rutted tire tracks, which can create tunneling between the loess and its less permeable bedrock. Causes and effects of loess failure in Afghanistan need to be investigated in more depth. Further study may lead to the adoption of more sustainable and safe farming practices and more informed housing locations, which may prevent loss of property, crop, and transport routes.

ID SUCCESSION
AB Several studies discussed a disagreement concerning forest extent in Poland between land cadaster and status on the ground. The aim of the paper was to assess the actual forest extent in Poland based on an existing spatial datasets such as: Digital Forest Map (covering explicitly the State Forests), Topographic Database, Database of Parcel Identification System, High Resolution Layer (Copernicus Land Monitoring product based on classification of satellite data) and National Forest Data Bank. The geospatial data analyses were preceded by an accuracy assessment of the available datasets, which allowed to assign weights to each of the dataset. The result of this project was the actual forest extent map, which refers to the national definition of forest as defined in the Forest Act of 28 September 1991 (forest by definition is a homogeneous area of 0.1 hectares). This includes all forms of ownership forests and areas that are forested, but officially recorded as non-forest. Moreover, the map of the forest extent under the Kyoto Protocol, including areas that meet the criteria of actual forest extent map and additionally forest areas designed or used for housing, recreation, infrastructure, and other industrial and agricultural areas (e.g.: permanent crops orchards) were determined. The results confirmed that the actual forest extent is higher by almost 800 thousand hectares then the official statistics provided by the Central Statistical Office of Poland. According to the official statistics forest in Poland covers 29.4% of the country, however this study revealed that 32% of the country, considering the national forest definition, and 33.5%, considering the forest definition under the Kyoto Protocol, is occupied by forest. It showed the need for the land cadaster update. Precise information on spatial distribution of forest extent is crucial for the national purposes i.e. reporting, implementation of the National Afforestation Program and also for the international commitments under the climate convention to determine the accurate forest carbon content and carbon dioxide sequestration.

AB Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are the key factors driving biodiversity and ecosystem services decline globally. This study examines spatiotemporal LULC changes in a Ramsar coastal temporary wetland (Larnaca Salt Lake) on the island of Cyprus between 1963 and 2015. LULC changes in the area are related to variations in the provision of ecosystem services (ES) namely food provision, climate regulation, avifauna support and landscape aesthetics. LULC mapping was performed based on the interpretation of aerial photos taken in 1963, while 2015 mapping was based on CORINE classification validated by satellite image analysis and fieldwork. We used the following indicators for the ES examined: (1) crops' yield for the estimation of food supply, (2) carbon storage potential for climate regulation, (3) land cover potential to support avifauna richness and (4) naturalness as a proxy for landscape aesthetics. Quantifications were based on a mixed-methods approach with the use of statistical data, expert opinion and bibliography. Estimates for every service were assigned to CORINE land use classes (CLC) present in the area. Landscape structure was measured using a suite of commonly employed landscape metrics. The results showed that between 1963 and 2015 there has been a significant reduction in food provisioning service by 75%, a 37% reduction in carbon storage capacity, an 11% reduction in the capacity to support avifauna, and a 13% reduction in landscape aesthetics. Increased soil surface sealing, mainly with the construction of the international airport, which resulted in the conversion of natural or semi-natural to artificial surfaces, has been the main reason for the decrease in ES supply over the last fifty years in the study area. The character of the area in terms of land use types richness and diversity remains fairly stable but the dominant land use types have experienced fragmentation. The study sets the basis for a monitoring scheme to evaluate the state of the temporary wetlands with emphasis placed on spatial processes as a link to ES provision.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK
AB The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been widely applied for flooding mapping based on change detection approaches. However, errors in the mapping result are expected since not all land-cover changes are flood-induced, and those changes are sensitive to SAR data, such as crop growth or harvest over agricultural lands, clearance of forested areas, and/or modifications on the urban landscape. This study, therefore, incorporated historical SAR images to boost the detection of flood-induced changes during extreme weather events, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Additionally, to incorporate the spatial signatures for the change detection, we applied a deep learning-based spatiotemporal simulation framework, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), for simulating a synthetic image using Sentinel One intensity time series. This synthetic image will be prepared in advance of flood events, and then it can be used to detect flood areas using change detection when the post-image is available. Practically, significant divergence between the synthetic image and post-image is expected over inundated zones, which can be mapped by applying thresholds to the Delta image (synthetic image minus post-image). We trained and tested our model on three events from Australia, Brazil, and Mozambique. The generated Flood Proxy Maps were compared against reference data derived from Sentinel Two and Planet Labs optical data. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we also generated Delta products for two baseline models (closest post-image minus pre-image and historical mean minus post-image) and two LSTM architectures: normal LSTM and ConvLSTM. Results show that thresholding of ConvLSTM Delta yielded the highest Cohen's Kappa coefficients in all study cases: 0.92 for Australia, 0.78 for Mozambique, and 0.68 for Brazil. Lower Kappa values obtained in the Mozambique case can be subject to the topographic effect on SAR imagery. These results still confirm the benefits in terms of classification accuracy that convolutional operations provide in time series analysis of satellite data employing spatially correlated information in a deep learning framework.

AB Agricultural drought is crucial in understanding the relationship to crop production functions which can be monitored using satellite remote sensors. The aim of this research is to combine temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) classifications for identifying drought areas in Chuping, Malaysia which has regularly recorded high temperatures. TVDI and NDWI are assessed using three images of the dry spell period in March for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. NDWI value representing water content in vegetation decreases numerically to -0.39, -0.37 and -0.36 for the year 2015, 2016 and 2017. Normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) values representing vegetation health status in the given area for images of years 2015 to 2017 decreases significantly (p <= 0.05) from 0.50 to 0.35 respectively. Overall, TVDI in the Chuping area showed agricultural drought with an average value of 0.46. However, Kilang Gula Chuping area in Chuping showed a significant increase in dryness for all of the three years assessed with an average value of 0.70. When both TVDI and NDWI were assessed, significant clustering of spots in Chuping, Perlis for all the 3 years was identified where geographical local regressions of 0.84, 0.70 and 0.70 for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 was determined. Furthermore, Moran's I values revealed that the research area had a high I value of 0.63, 0.30 and 0.23 with respective Z scores of 17.80, 8.63 and 6.77 for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, indicating that the cluster relationship is significant in the 95-99 percent confidence interval. Using both indices alone was sufficient to understand the drier spots of Chuping over 3 years. The findings of this research will be of interest to local agriculture authorities, like plantation and meteorology departments to understand drier areas in the state to evaluate water deficits severity and cloud seeding points during drought.

AB Semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land mainly includes extensively managed grasslands, agro-forestry areas and all vegetated features that are not used for crop production, such as hedgerows, buffer strips, field margins and woodlots. Semi-natural vegetation plays a major role in the supply of ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, water quality control and erosion prevention. The efficiency of ecosystem services for agriculture should therefore depend upon the spatial distribution of semi-natural vegetation. In spite of such a relevance, semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land has never been mapped at the European scale. Therefore, we report here the first 1- km resolution map of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land at the European Union scale. For that, we use an innovative convergence-of-evidence mapping method. We also present an assessment and a classification of the relation between semi-natural vegetation and ecosystem service supply at the regional scale. The major improvements in our mapping method are the following: (1) both large and small patches of perennial vegetation are detected in fine-resolution satellite images by incorporating the spectral rule-based preliminary classifier, (2) the identification of semi-natural grassland is enhanced, (3) European ancillary maps are used to help mapping of woody vegetation and identification of agro-ecosystems. Validation shows that our output map is 34.3 % more accurate than pre-existing components. In addition, results show that regulating ecosystem services increase with the abundance of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural lands with a coefficient R (2) of 0.67. The results also show no specific trend in relation to provisioning ecosystem services. These findings mean that semi-natural vegetation is usually beneficial for regulating services, whereas the relation to provisioning services is strictly context-dependent. Overall our study supports greening measures design in the frame of the Common Agricultural Policy for 2014-2020. Results also will help to identify green infrastructure elements and priority areas for ecological restoration.

AB Croplands are commonly mapped using time series of remotely sensed images. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is an effective method for realizing this. However, DTW algorithm faces the challenge of capturing complete and accurate representative cropland time series on a national scale, especially in Asian countries where climatic and topographic conditions, cropland types, and crop growth patterns vary significantly. This study proposes an automatic cropland extraction method based on the DTW algorithm and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), hereinafter referred to as ACE-DTW, to map croplands in Pakistan in 2015. First, 422 frames of multispectral Landsat-8 satellite images were selected from the Google Earth Engine to construct monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Next, a total of 2409 training samples of six land cover types were generated randomly and explained visually using high-resolution remotely sensed images. Then, a multi-layer DBSCAN was used to classify NDVI time series of training samples into different categories automatically based on their pairwise DTW distances, and the mean NDVI time series of each category was used as the standard time series to represent the characteristics of that category. These standard time series attempted to represent cropland information and maximally distinguished croplands from other possible interference land cover types. Finally, image pixels were classified as cropland or non-cropland based on their DTW distances to the standard time series of the six land cover types. The overall cropland extraction accuracy of ACE-DTW was 89.7%, which exceeded those of other supervised classifiers (classification and regression trees: 78.2%; support vector machines: 78.8%) and existing global cropland datasets (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover: 87.1%; Global Food Security Support Analysis Data: 83.1%). Further, ACE-DTW could produce relatively complete time series of variable cropland types, and thereby provide a significant advantage in mountain regions with small, fragmented croplands and plain regions with large, high-density patches of croplands.

AB The overarching goal of this research was to develop and demonstrate an automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) that will rapidly, routinely, and accurately classify agricultural cropland extent, areas, and characteristics (e.g., irrigated vs. rainfed) over large areas such as a country or a region through combination of multi-sensor remote sensing and secondary data. In this research, a rule-based ACCA was conceptualized, developed, and demonstrated for the country of Tajikistan using mega file data cubes (MFDCs) involving data from Landsat Global Land Survey (GLS), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30 m, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m time-series, a suite of secondary data (e.g., elevation, slope, precipitation, temperature), and in situ data. First, the process involved producing an accurate reference (or truth) cropland layer (TCL), consisting of cropland extent, areas, and irrigated vs. rainfed cropland areas, for the entire country of Tajikistan based on MFDC of year 2005 (MFDC2005). The methods involved in producing TCL included using ISOCLASS clustering, Tasseled Cap bi-spectral plots, spectro-temporal characteristics from MODIS 250 m monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maximum value composites (MVC) time-series, and textural characteristics of higher resolution imagery. The TCL statistics accurately matched with the national statistics of Tajikistan for irrigated and rainfed croplands, where about 70% of croplands were irrigated and the rest rainfed. Second, a rule-based ACCA was developed to replicate the TCL accurately (similar to 80% producer's and user's accuracies or within 20% quantity disagreement involving about 10 million Landsat 30 m sized cropland pixels of Tajikistan). Development of ACCA was an iterative process involving series of rules that are coded, refined, tweaked, and re-coded till ACCA derived croplands (ACLs) match accurately with TCLs. Third, the ACCA derived cropland layers of Tajikistan were produced for year 2005 (ACL2005), same year as the year used for developing ACCA, using MFDC2005. Fourth, TCL for year 2010 (TCL2010), an independent year, was produced using MFDC2010 using the same methods and approaches as the one used to produce TCL2005. Fifth, the ACCA was applied on MFDC2010 to derive ACL2010. The ACLs were then compared with TCLs (ACL2005 vs. TCL2005 and ACL2010 vs. TCL2010). The resulting accuracies and errors from error matrices involving about 152 million Landsat (30 m) pixels of the country of Tajikistan (of which about 10 million Landsat size, 30 m, cropland pixels) showed an overall accuracy of 99.6% (k(hat) = 0.97) for ACL2005 vs. TCL2005. For the 3 classes (irrigated, rainfed, and others) mapped in ACL2005, the producer's accuracy was >86.4% and users accuracy was >93.6%. For ACL2010 vs. TCL2010, the error matrix showed an overall accuracy on 96.2% (k(hat) = 0.96). For the 3 classes (irrigated, rainfed, and others) mapped in ACL2010, the producer's and user's accuracies for the irrigated areas were >= 82.9%. Any intermixing was overwhelmingly between irrigated and rainfed croplands, indicating that croplands (irrigated plus rainfed areas) as well as irrigated areas were mapped with high levels of accuracies (similar to 90% or higher) even for the independent year. The ACL2005 and ACL2010, each, were produced using ACCA algorithm in. similar to 30 min using a Dell Precision desktop T7400 computer for the entire country of Tajikistan once the MFDCs for the years were ready.
   The ACCA algorithm for Tajikistan is made available through US Geological Survey's ScienceBase: http://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/folder/4f79f1b7e4b0009bd827f548 or at: https://powellcenter.usgs.gov/globalcroplandwater/content/models-algorithms. The research contributes to the efforts of global food security through research on global croplands and their water use (e.g., https://powellcenter.usgs.gov/globalcroplandwater/). The above results clearly demonstrated the ability of a rule-based ACCA to rapidly and accurately produce cropland data layer year after year (hindcast, nowcast, forecast) for the country it was developed using MFDCs that consist of combining multiple sensor data and secondary data. It needs to be noted that the ACCA is applicable to the area (e.g., country, region) for which it is developed. In this case, ACCA is applicable for the Country of Tajikistan to hindcast, nowcast, and forecast agricultural cropland extent, areas, and irrigated vs. rainfed. The same fundamental concept of ACCA applies to other areas of the World where ACCA codes need to be modified to suite the area/region of interest. ACCA can also be expanded to compute other crop characteristics such as crop types, cropping intensities, and phenologies.

AB Monitoring spatial and temporal variability of vegetation is important to manage land and water resources, with significant impact on the sustainability of modern agriculture. Cloud cover noticeably reduces the temporal resolution of retrievals based on optical data. COSMO-SkyMed (the new Italian Synthetic Aperture RADAR-SAR) opened new opportunities to develop agro-hydrological applications. Indeed, it represents a valuable source of data for operational use, due to the high spatial and temporal resolutions. Although X-band is not the most suitable to model agricultural and hydrological processes, an assessment of vegetation development can be achieved combing optical vegetation indices (VIs) and SAR backscattering data. In this paper, a correlation analysis has been performed between the crossed horizontal-vertical (HV) backscattering (sigma degrees(HV)) and optical VIs (VIopt) on several plots. The correlation analysis was based on incidence angle, spatial resolution and polarization mode. Results have shown that temporal changes of sigma degrees(HV) (Delta sigma degrees(HV)) acquired with high angles (off nadir angle; theta > 40 degrees) best correlates with variations of VIopt (Delta VI). The correlation between Delta VI and Delta sigma degrees(HV) has been shown to be temporally robust. Based on this experimental evidence, a model to infer a VI from sigma degrees (VISAR) at the time, t(i + 1), once known, the VIopt at a reference time, t(i), and Delta sigma degrees(HV) between times, t(i + 1) and t(i), was implemented and verified. This approach has led to the development and validation of an algorithm for coupling a VIopt derived from DEIMOS-1 images and sigma degrees(HV). The study was carried out over the Sele plain (Campania, Italy), which is mainly characterized by herbaceous crops. In situ measurements included leaf area index LAI), which were collected weekly between August and September 2011 in 25 sites, simultaneously to COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and DEIMOS-1 imaging. Results confirm that VISAR obtained using the combined model is able to increase the feasibility of operational satellite-based products for supporting agricultural practices. This study is carried out in the framework of the COSMOLAND project (Use of COSMO-SkyMed SAR data for LAND cover classification and surface parameters retrieval over agricultural sites) funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).

AB Anthropogenic land degradation affects many biogeophysical processes, including reductions of net primary production (NPP). Degradation occurs at scales from small fields to continental and global. While measurement and monitoring of NPP in small areas is routine in some studies, for scales larger than 1 km(2), and certainly global, there is no regular monitoring and certainly no attempt to measure degradation. Quantitative and repeatable techniques to assess the extent of deleterious effects and monitor changes are needed to evaluate its effects on, for example, economic yields of primary products such as crops, lumber, and forage, and as a measure of land surface properties which are currently missing from dynamic global vegetation models, assessments of carbon sequestration, and land surface models of heat, water, and carbon exchanges. This study employed the local NPP scaling (LNS) approach to identify patterns of anthropogenic degradation of NPP in the Burdekin Dry Tropics (BDT) region of Queensland, Australia, from 2000 to 2013. The method starts with land classification based on the environmental factors presumed to control (NPP) to group pixels having similar potential NPP. Then, satellite remotely sensing data were used to compare actual NPP with its potential. The difference in units of mass of carbon and percentage loss were the measure of degradation. The entire BDT (7.45 x 10(6) km(2)) was investigated at a spatial resolution of 250 x 250 m. The average annual reduction in NPP due to anthropogenic land degradation in the entire BDT was -2.14 Mg C m(-2) yr(-1), or 17% of the non-degraded potential, and the total reduction was -214 Mg C yr(-1). Extreme average annual losses of 524.8 gC m(-2) yr(-1) were detected. Approximately 20% of the BDT was classified as "degraded". Varying severities and rates of degradation were found among the river basins, of which the Belyando and Suttor were highest. Interannual, negative trends in reductions of NPP occurred in 7% of the entire region, indicating ongoing degradation. There was evidence of areas that were in a permanently degraded condition. The findings provide strong evidence and quantitative data for reductions in NPP related to anthropogenic land degradation in the BDT.

AB A Global Irrigated Area Map (GIAM) has been produced for the end of the last millennium using multiple satellite sensor, secondary, Google Earth and groundtruth data. The data included: (a) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 3-band and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10 km monthly time-series for 1997-1999, (b) Systeme pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT VGT) NDVI 1 km monthly time series for 1999, (c) East Anglia University Climate Research Unit (CRU) rainfall 50 km monthly time series for 1961-2000, (d) Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30) 1 km digital elevation data of the World, (e) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (JERS-1 SAR) data for the rain forests during two seasons in 1996 and (f) University of Maryland Global Tree Cover 1 km data for 1992-1993. A single mega-file data-cube (MFDC) of the World with 159 layers, akin to hyperspectral data, was composed by re-sampling different data types into a common 1 km resolution. The MFDC was segmented based on elevation, temperature and precipitation zones. Classification was performed on the segments.
   Quantitative spectral matching techniques (SMTs) used in hyperspectral data analysis were adopted to group class spectra derived from unsupervised classification and match them with ideal or target spectra. A rigorous class identification and labelling process involved the use of: (a) space-time spiral curve (ST-SC) plots, (b) brightness-greenness-wetness (BGW) plots, (c) time series NDVI plots, (d) Google Earth very-high-resolution imagery (VHRI) 'zoom-in views' in over 11 000 locations, (e) groundtruth data broadly sourced from the degree confluence project (3 864 sample locations) and from the GIAM project (1 790 sample locations), (f) high-resolution Landsat-ETM+ Geocover 150 m mosaic of the World and (g) secondary data (e. g. national and global land use and land cover data). Mixed classes were resolved based on decision tree algorithms and spatial modelling, and when that did not work, the problem class was used to mask and re-classify the MDFC, and the class identification and labelling protocol repeated. The sub-pixel area (SPA) calculations were performed by multiplying full-pixel areas (FPAs) with irrigated area fractions (IAFs) for every class.
   A 28 class GIAM was produced and the area statistics reported as: (a) annualized irrigated areas (AIAs), which consider intensity of irrigation (i.e. sum of irrigated areas from different seasons in a year plus continuous year-round irrigation or gross irrigated areas), and (b) total area available for irrigation (TAAI), which does not consider intensity of irrigation (i.e. irrigated areas at any given point of time plus the areas left fallow but 'equipped for irrigation' at the same point of time or net irrigated areas). The AIA of the World at the end of the last millennium was 467 million hectares (Mha), which is sum of the non-overlapping areas of: (a) 252 Mha from season one, (b) 174 Mha from season two and (c) 41 Mha from continuous year-round crops. The TAAI at the end of the last millennium was 399 Mha. The distribution of irrigated areas is highly skewed amongst continents and countries. Asia accounts for 79% (370 Mha) of all AIAs, followed by Europe (7%) and North America (7%). Three continents, South America (4%), Africa (2%) and Australia (1%), have a very low proportion of the global irrigation. The GIAM had an accuracy of 79-91%, with errors of omission not exceeding 21%, and the errors of commission not exceeding 23%. The GIAM statistics were also compared with: (a) the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and University of Frankfurt (UF) derived irrigated areas and (b) national census data for India. The relationships and causes of differences are discussed in detail. The GIAM products are made available through a web portal (http://www.iwmigiam.org).

AB The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is biologically diverse, economically important, and home to about 65 million people. The region has undergone extensive environmental changes since the 1990s due to such factors as agricultural expansion and intensification, deforestation, more river damming, increased urbanization, growing human populations, expansion of industrial forest plantations, plus frequent natural disasters from flooding and drought. The Mekong river is also heavily used for human transportation, fishing, drinking water, and irrigation. This paper discusses use of pre-existing LULC maps from 1997 and 2010 to derive a LMB regional LULC change map for 9 classes per date using GIS overlay techniques. The change map was derived to aid SWAT hydrologic modeling applications in the LMB, given the 2010 map is currently used in multiple LMB SWAT models, whereas the 1997 map was previously used. The 2010 LULC map was constructed from Landsat and MODIS satellite data, while the 1997 map was from before the MODIS era and therefore based on available Landsat data. The 1997-2010 LULC change map showed multiple trends. Permanent agriculture had expanded in certain sub-basins into previously forested areas. Some agricultural areas were converted to industrial forest plantations. Extensive forest changes also occurred in some locations, such as areas changed to shifting cultivation or permanent crops. Also, the 1997 map under classified some urban areas, whereas the 2010 LULC map showed improved identification of such areas. LULC map accuracy were assessed for 213 randomly sampled locations. The 1997 and 2010 LULC maps showed high overall agreements with reference data exceeding 87%. The LULC change map yielded a moderately high level of overall agreement (78%) that improved to similar to 83% once LULC classification scheme specificity was reduced (forests and agriculture were each mapped as singular classes). The change map regionally showed a 4% decrease in agriculture and a 4% increase in deciduous and evergreen forests combined, though deforestation hot spot areas also were evident. The project yielded LULC map data sets that are now available for aiding additional studies that assess LMB LULC change and the impacts such change may pose to water, agriculture, forestry, and disaster management efforts. More work is needed to map, quantify and assess LULC change since 2010 and to further update the 2010 LULC map currently used in the LMB SWAT models.

AB The annual trace gas emissions from a West African rural region were calculated using direct observations of gas emissions and burning practices, and the findings compared to the guidelines published by the IPCC. This local-scale study was conducted around the village of Dalun in the Northern Region of Ghana, near the regional capital of Tamale. Two types of fires were found in the region - agricultural fires and wildfires. Agricultural fires are intentionally set in order to remove shrub and crop residues; wildfires are mostly ignited by herders to remove inedible grasses and to promote the growth of fresh grass. An agricultural fire is ignited with a fire front moving against the wind (backfire), whereas a wildfire moves with the wind (headfire). Gas emissions (CO2, CO and NO) were measured by burning eight experimental plots, simulating both headfires and backfires. A common method of evaluating burning conditions is to calculate modified combustion efficiency (MCE), which expresses the percentage of the trace gases released as CO2. Modified combustion efficiency was 95% in the wildfires burned as headfires, but only 90% in the backfires. The burned area in the study region was determined by classifying a SPOT HRV satellite image taken about two months into the dry season. Fires were classified as either old burned areas or new burned areas as determined by the gradient in moisture content in the vegetation from the onset of the dry season. Classified burned areas were subsequently divided into two classes depending on whether the location was in the cultivated area or in the rangeland area, this sub-classification thus indicating whether the fire had been burned as a backfire or headfire. Findings showed that the burned area was 48% of the total region, and that the ratio of lowland wildfires to agricultural fires was 3:1. The net trace gas release from the classified vegetation burnings were extrapolated to 26-46 x 10(8) g CO2, 78-302 x 10(6) g CO, 17-156 x 10(5) g CH4, 16-168 x 10(5) g NMHC and 11-72 x 10(3) NOx. Calculation of the emissions using proposed IPCC default values on burned area and average biomass resulted in a net emission 5 to 10 times higher than the measured emission values. It was found that the main reason for this discrepancy was not the emission factors used by the IPCC, but an exaggerated fuel load estimate.

AB Background: Mapping the spatial distribution of the dengue vector Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and accurately predicting its abundance are crucial for designing effective vector control strategies and early warning tools for dengue epidemic prevention. Socio-ecological and landscape factors influence Ae. aegypti abundance. Therefore, we aimed to map the spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti and predict its abundance in northeastern Thailand based on socioeconomic, climate change, and dengue knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) and/or landscape factors using machine learning (ML)-based system.
   Method: A total of 1066 females adult Ae. aegypti were collected from four villages in northeastern Thailand during January-December 2019. Information on household socioeconomics, KAP regarding climate change and dengue, and satellite-based landscape data were also acquired. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to map the household-based spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). Five popular supervised learning models, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF), were used to predict females adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). The predictive accuracy of each modeling technique was calculated and evaluated. Important variables for predicting female adult Ae. aegypti abundance were also identified using the best-fitted model.
   Results: Urban areas had higher abundance of female adult Ae. aegypti compared to rural areas. Overall, study respondents in both urban and rural areas had inadequate KAP regarding climate change and dengue. The average landscape factors per household in urban areas were rice crop (47.4%), natural tree cover (17.8%), built-up area (13.2%), permanent wetlands (21.2%), and rubber plantation (0%), and the corresponding figures for rural areas were 12.1, 2.0, 38.7, 40.1 and 0.1% respectively. Among all assessed models, RF showed the best prediction performance (socioeconomics: area under curve, AUC = 0.93, classification accuracy, CA = 0.86, F1 score = 0.85; KAP: AUC = 0.95, CA = 0.92, F1 = 0.90; landscape: AUC = 0.96, CA = 0.89, F1 = 0.87) for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance. The combined influences of all factors further improved the predictive accuracy in RF model (socioeconomics + KAP + landscape: AUC = 0.99, CA = 0.96 and F1 = 0.95). Dengue prevention practices were shown to be the most important predictor in the RF model for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand.
   Conclusion: The RF model is more suitable for the prediction of Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand. Our study exemplifies that the application of GIS and machine learning systems has significant potential for understanding the spatial distribution of dengue vectors and predicting its abundance. The study findings might help optimize vector control strategies, future mosquito suppression, prediction and control strategies of epidemic arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). Such strategies can be incorporated into One Health approaches applying transdisciplinary approaches considering human-vector and agro-environmental interrelationships.

TI Cloud and cloud shadow screening across Queensland, Australia: An
   automated method for Landsat TM/ETM plus time series

ID COVER; DYNAMICS; IMAGERY
AB The 20 + year collection and moderate resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery provide a crucial data source for analysing land surface change over time for a range of applications. In Queensland, Australia, a number of government policies, natural resource management programmes and research activities are reliant on large-area, multi-temporal land cover monitoring applications based on Landsat satellite imagery. However, clouds and associated cloud shadows frequently obstruct the view of the land surface. The restriction of analyses to cloud-free imagery will reduce the opportunities to sample the land surface and limit the analysis of trends in reflectance overtime. This study presents a new automated method to screen cloud and cloud shadow and is intended for application to entire time series of Landsat imagery rather than single images processed in near- real time. The method uses a hierarchical approach and takes advantage of spectral, temporal, and contextual information. Outliers are located relative to the time series of land surface reflectance by smoothing time series information using minimum and median filters which are then used in multi-temporal image differencing. Seeded region grow and morphological dilation (pixel buffering) filters are then applied to map a larger spatial extent of the cloud/cloud shadow. Spectral and contextual rules were developed empirically using calibration and validation data derived from six Landsat WRS Path/Rows (number of images = 60) with varying climatic and land surface characteristics across the state of Queensland, Australia. The validation demonstrates that cloud contaminated pixels were accurately classified with producer's, user's and overall accuracies of 98, 87 and 97%, respectively. The ability to detect cloud shadow was less accurate, in comparison, with producer's, user's and overall accuracies of 90, 62 and 97%, respectively. The pixel buffer was found to be the largest source of commission error for cloud and cloud shadow in the final classifications. However, for many applications removing additional cloud/shadow at the expense of higher commission errors may be desirable. The performance of the method was also compared with the published Fmask (Function of mask) method. This demonstrated a moderate improvement in the detection of cloud (producer's accuracies: time series 98% and Fmask 90%; and an equivalent user's accuracy of 87%), and a significant improvement in the detection of cloud shadow (producer's accuracies: time series 90% and Fmask 78%; user's accuracies: time series 62% and Fmask 50%). Importantly, the results indicate that this automated method is robust and that temporal information can improve the detection of cloud and cloud shadow, although shadow detection above cropping areas is limited. The calibration/validation of the method has been restricted to Queensland, Australia. With further development there is potential for this method or one using a similar framework to have wider application in other landscapes. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

DE Soil moisture; Temporal persistence; Downscaling
ID STABILITY; SURFACE; CLIMATE
AB Soil moisture estimation is an integral component of operational hydrology including flood forecasting, drought monitoring, catchment management, and groundwater recharge estimation. Typically, soil moisture information is required at variable spatial scales for the above applications. As a result, soil moisture data at one spatial scale are often aggregated to larger areas or disaggregated to smaller areas for a particular application. There is also increasing demand for accurate downscaling of satellite derived data to smaller spatial resolutions. This transition in spatial scale is often fraught with uncertainties because of the high spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture. However, the rank of soil moisture at a particular location in relation to other spatial locations is widely known to be temporally stable at a certain probability. The concept of temporal persistence of soil moisture offers the potential to better estimate soil moisture across spatial scales. The application of temporal persistence for estimation of soil moisture across spatial scales has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. As a result, this study examines the relationship between the rank stability of soil moisture and physiographic features including vegetation types and soil texture groups. This investigation provides physiographic explanations for temporal persistence of soil moisture, and therefore facilitate soil moisture estimation across scales.
   To assess the estimation across scales, soil moisture data for three spatial resolutions of 12-k m, 5-k m, and 1-km data for the Yanco region in New South Wales, Australia were used. The soil moisture data for the 12-k m, 5-k m and 1-k m resolutions are land surface model estimates obtained from the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES). The vegetation data set was obtained from the Australian National Dynamic Land Cover Data set (DLCD). The DLCD was generated from a 16-day Enhanced Vegetation Index composite collected at 250-m resolution from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) for the period from 2000 to 2008. The DLCD has land cover features clustered into 34 ISO classes with descriptions for the structural character of vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops and pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open grasslands.
   The soil texture data set was derived from the Digital Atlas of Australian Soils which was obtained from the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS). ASRIS provides a digital map of soil types and their descriptions, typical ranges for soil properties for each soil type, morphology, and physical properties of soil profiles. The soil classification in ASRIS has six main textural groups including sands, sandy loams, loams, clay loams, clay, and light clays. Moreover, the meteorological forcing data including short and long wave incoming radiation, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, pressure, and specific humidity were obtained from the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator - Australian (ACCESS-A) at hourly time step with approximately 12-k m spatial resolution. The ACCESS-A precipitation data set was bias corrected using a 5-k m gridded precipitation data from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) data obtained through the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
   The results identified temporally stable locations between the three resolution pairs with a percent relative difference of about 6% maximum and 0.1% minimum; indicating that the overall difference for downscaling soil moisture across the three resolution pairs is about 3% of the original value. It was found that temporal stability of soil moisture can facilitate downscaling of soil moisture across different spatial scales, with improved accuracy for decreasing size of spatial resolution. Soil texture and vegetation land cover do not provide strong indicators to identify temporally stable locations, with vegetation cover having a higher correlation than soil texture because of its high homogeneity in the Yanco area.
